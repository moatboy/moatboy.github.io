{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Ameren's moat stems primarily from its regulated utility business.  Regulated utilities often enjoy regional monopolies, creating barriers to entry for competitors. This provides a degree of pricing power and stable cash flows.  However, this moat is relatively narrow. Regulatory bodies restrict the returns that utilities can earn on their investments, limiting their profit potential.  Furthermore, technological advancements (e.g., distributed generation, renewable energy) and increasing competition in certain segments (e.g., customer acquisition in deregulated markets) are gradually eroding the traditional advantages enjoyed by utilities.

> Ameren acknowledges increased competition in the distributed generation space, specifically solar and wind power (Q3 2023 earnings call).


**Management (3/5):**

Management quality is a mixed bag. Positives include:

* **Consistent dividend growth:** Ameren has a long history of dividend increases, indicating a focus on returning cash to shareholders. (This aligns with the principles of "intrinsic investing" emphasized by Benjamin Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*).
* **Constructive regulatory relationships:** Ameren actively participates in regulatory proceedings and seems to maintain reasonable relationships with regulatory bodies. This is critical for a regulated utility.  As per Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, regulations are most useful when they do something "nice" for the company by limiting competition.
* **Focus on core business:** Ameren's focus on its core utility operations indicates a degree of capital allocation discipline. (In *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, Buffett emphasizes the importance of "capital allocation" as crucial for a company's long-term success).

However, there are also some concerns:

* **Limited growth:** Ameren operates in a mature, low-growth industry. While the company has pursued some growth initiatives (e.g., renewable energy investments), these have not yet translated into significant growth rates. (As discussed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, growth is a key driver of value but achieving it can be harder than it looks, especially in mature industries).
* **Moderate insider ownership:** While some insider ownership exists, it is not substantial enough to fully align management's interests with those of shareholders. (Buffett advocates for significant insider ownership in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*).
* **Opaque communication:**  While Ameren provides some financial and operational information, it lacks the transparency desired by intrinsic investors, especially in its segment disclosures. As shown in company financials, limited information is provided about the performance of the business units, such as unique visitors.
* **Below-average ROIC:** Ameren's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), even adjusted for internally-generated intangible assets,  is mediocre, hovering around its cost of capital. (As explained in *Valuation*, a company must be able to sustainably earn a return on its capital that exceeds its cost of capital to be considered for purchase).

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts include:

* **Infrastructure investment:**  Ameren has plans for substantial infrastructure investments, which could lead to higher allowed returns and improved profitability in the future. This is reflected in their latest 10K filings. For example, in the Q3 2023 call, Ameren Missouri announced a large multiyear infrastructure upgrade plan for electric transmission.
* **Regulatory changes:** Favorable changes in the regulatory environment could improve allowed returns and boost earnings. As discussed in *Valuation*, the regulatory environment is important when valuing utility companies as regulatory bodies determine the rate of return a utility can earn. 
* **Acquisitions in adjacent markets:** Ameren mentions mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in regulated spaces as part of their long-term strategy. If Ameren makes value-creating acquisitions, this could positively affect value.


**Valuation ($12.20 Billion):**

We will value Ameren using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, following the principles laid out in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*.  We will use a business-as-usual scenario assuming modest growth and moderate returns on new investments, reflecting our somewhat pessimistic outlook. As per *The Essays of Warren Buffet*, when making valuations, use the cash flows projected by the management when creating a DCF.

**Assumptions:**

* **Explicit forecast period:** 5 years (Given the volatility and difficulty of making long-term forecasts in the utility industry, we prefer a shorter forecast period. As stated in *The Intelligent Investor*, forecasts must be grounded in the economics of the business being valued)
* **Revenue growth:** 2% (reflecting the projected long-run historical growth rate of the electric and natural gas distribution markets)
* **Operating margin:** 20% (Ameren's average operating margin from 2008 to 2022, a pessimistic estimate that takes into account recent margin pressure)
* **Tax rate:** 25% (in line with historical averages, keeping in mind potential for change in tax laws as discussed in *Valuation*)
* **Reinvestment rate:** 60% (This implies an expected Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) in the continuing value period of 7.8%. This is only slightly above the cost of capital of 7.5%, reflecting our pessimism about returns exceeding cost of capital).
* **Cost of capital:** 7.5% (Weighed average cost of capital, based on a target capital structure of 44% debt and 56% equity)
* **Continuing value:** Growing perpetuity (In *Valuation*, it is recommended that for DCF valuations the discount rate for perpetuity be less than the cost of capital.
)
* **Growth rate in perpetuity:** 2%
* **Terminal year:** 2028


**Calculations:**

1. **NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes):** Computed for each year of the explicit forecast period using the assumed revenue growth and operating margin.
2. **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** Computed for each year by subtracting reinvestment from NOPLAT. Reinvestment = Change in invested capital = Capital Expenditures + Change in Working Capital. 
3. **Present Value of FCFF:** Discounted each year's FCFF back to the present value using the cost of capital.
4. **Continuing Value:** Computed using the growing perpetuity formula at the end of the explicit forecast period. Continuing value = (NOPLAT in 2029 * (1+g))/(WACC-g). 
5. **Present Value of Continuing Value:**  Discounted back to the present value using the cost of capital.
6. **Enterprise Value:** Sum of present values of FCFF and continuing value.
7. **Equity Value:** Subtract market value of debt and other non-equity claims (minority interests, preferred stock) from enterprise value.  We use the book value of debt as a proxy for the market value of debt given the stability of Ameren's financials.
8. **Value per share:** Divide equity value by number of shares outstanding.

**Valuation Summary (in $ millions):**

|       | 2024 | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | Total |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Revenue| 5,112| 5,214| 5,317| 5,422| 5,529|      |
| NOPLAT| 1,022 | 1,043 | 1,064 | 1,085 | 1,107|      |
| FCFF  | 410  | 417  | 425  | 433  | 441  |      |
| PV of FCFF   | 370  | 340  | 313  | 288  | 266  | 1,577|
| Continuing Value |       |       |       |       | 10,650| 10,650|
| PV of Continuing Value |   |   |   |   | 8,626 | 8,626 |
| Enterprise Value | |   |   |   |  | 10,203 |
| Debt  | | | | | (1,560) | (1,560) |
| Equity Value|   |   |   |   |       | 8,643 |
| Value/share       |     $43.06 |


> **Important Note:** These calculations are simplified. We are using consensus estimates for annual data, and the financial statements are incomplete.  Moreover, we have assumed no change in capital structure or major asset sales. These simplifications could introduce bias and are just for the purpose of providing a quick, illustrative valuation. 

Therefore, based on our business-as-usual scenario and DCF valuation, Ameren's implied equity value is approximately $8.643 billion, or $43.06 per share. (Note this is above its price of $41.40 as of 2024).


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

Ameren has faced scrutiny regarding its proposed rate increases and the environmental impact of its coal-fired power plants.

> Ameren discusses the issues around the Rush Island Energy Center in its Q3 2023 earnings call, noting the planned closing of the coal plant in the early 2030s.


**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Successful execution of infrastructure investments:**  If Ameren can successfully execute its infrastructure investments and achieve the projected returns, this could significantly boost earnings and potentially lead to a higher valuation.
* **Regulatory support for clean energy initiatives:**  Increasing regulatory support for clean energy investments could accelerate Ameren's transition to renewable energy sources and potentially create new growth opportunities.


**Catalyst Rating:** 2/5 (The catalyst rating is moderate. While the infrastructure investments and clean energy initiatives have the potential to create value, there is a degree of uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of their impact).
