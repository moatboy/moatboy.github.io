{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5): Narrow Moat**

Workday's moat rests primarily on **high switching costs**, a trait highlighted in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.  Once a company implements Workday's software, it becomes deeply embedded in the organization's processes, making it difficult and costly to switch to a competitor. This stickiness stems from:

* **Integration:** Workday's products are tightly integrated, offering a unified platform for HCM and financial management.  Switching would require significant effort to transfer data and retrain employees, as explained in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company.
* **Data:**  Migrating massive amounts of employee data is a complex undertaking, creating a significant disincentive to switching. This data sensitivity is analogous to that found in financial service firms, as described in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation.*
* **Training:** Companies invest substantially in training employees on Workday’s systems, making it costly to switch to another platform that would require retraining.
* **Network Effects (Limited):** While not as prominent as switching costs, Workday benefits from network effects within certain industries and for certain functionalities. As more companies in a particular sector use Workday, the value of using Workday increases, especially as integrations and partnerships arise between them.

{: .warning }
However, Workday's moat is not impenetrable. Competitors like Oracle and SAP continue to innovate, and the emergence of new players could exert pressure in the future. Moreover, the network effects, while present, are not yet as strong as those enjoyed by companies like Microsoft or Adobe.   As the Morgan Stanley report on moats highlights, network effects are most powerful in closed systems, and Workday’s relatively open architecture could limit the power of these effects.


**Management (3/5): Solid but Not Exceptional**

Workday's management team receives a mixed rating. While they've successfully guided the company through a period of impressive growth, some red flags exist:

* **Capital Allocation:**  While Workday’s overall capital allocation seems reasonable so far, with their foray into strategic acquisitions, it’s too early to tell whether the acquired companies were worth the premium paid, and whether these acquisitions will ultimately create value. Their acquisitions often seem to be overpriced, raising questions about how judiciously they use capital, echoing Michael Burry’s emphasis on prudent capital allocation.
{: .note }
* **Communication:**  While the company seems to have taken a slightly more conservative approach to their guidance (especially post-pandemic), their investor communication is still not always straightforward and transparent, lacking the depth of insights provided by other companies that favor candid communication as a means of building trust, as discussed in Warren Buffett's shareholder letters.   For example, Workday does not provide detailed breakdowns of revenues and operating margins for individual business units, which could enhance transparency and investor understanding of its business. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is substantial and largely equity-based, which is not unusual in the technology sector. However, the pay packages could be perceived as excessive by some investors, raising the specter of potential conflicts of interest between managers and shareholders, a concern often raised by Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*.
* **Insider Ownership:** While insider ownership is reasonable, it's not high enough to offer a strong indication of management's long-term commitment to shareholder value creation.

**Catalyst (2/5): Moderate Potential**

* **International Expansion:** Workday has significant opportunities for growth in international markets, where cloud adoption rates are still relatively low. Successful expansion could be a catalyst for share price appreciation, but also comes with increased risk from currency fluctuations.
* **Expansion into New Verticals:** Workday has the potential to expand into new verticals beyond HCM and financial management. Success in new markets could drive growth, although competition will also be stronger.
* **Product Innovation:** Continued investment in product innovation could strengthen Workday's competitive position and attract new customers. However, innovation in enterprise software is difficult, and the company will need to execute well in order to achieve commercial success. As mentioned in the Q3 2021 earnings call, Workday is seeing continued momentum in its efforts to build and provide industry-specific solutions. This strategy seems like an opportunity to drive growth, but also makes it even more important that they listen to customers and address challenges related to industry development and technological change.
* **AI and Machine Learning:** Workday has made some progress in AI and Machine learning, which is relevant for enhancing financial and human capital management workflows. The company's AI capabilities could become a more important part of its platform in the years ahead, a sentiment mentioned in the Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 earnings call.


**Valuation ($51.3 Billion):**

Given the difficulty in predicting long-term growth for software companies, I opted for a conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) approach. The financials are for Workday's fiscal year ending January 31. The most recently completed fiscal year was in January 2023. Using a 10-year explicit forecast period and the methodology outlined in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation,* I arrived at the following valuation:

**Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:** Assume an initial growth of 15% for the first two years (Workday stated revenue growth in the Q3 2023 earnings call has been running at about 18% - but the current economic backdrop looks uncertain, and growth could potentially decline) and gradually decreases to a terminal growth of 2% in 10 years, consistent with U.S. GDP growth and low inflation and low-interest rates (Q1 2024 Earnings Call).
* **Operating Margin:**  Assume a gradual increase from 20% to a terminal 25% in 10 years (Workday's stated long-term operating margin has been growing from the low teens in post-crisis years (2009-13) to close to 20% now, so I've used 25% as my base-case assumption over the longer term, with 35% as my optimistic scenario, and 20% as my pessimistic one, from the Q4 2023 Earnings Call).
* **Tax Rate:** Based on their recent history, use a 25% tax rate. 
* **Sales/Invested Capital Ratio:** Assume 2, indicating industry-average capital intensity.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Calculated as 1 - (FCFE/Net Income), and will decrease with revenue growth to arrive at terminal value year.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  
* **Cost of Equity:**  Risk-free rate = 4% (10-Year U.S. Treasury yield), Beta = 1.20, Equity Risk Premium = 4%. Cost of equity = 4% + 1.20 * 4% = 8.8%. 
* **Cost of Debt:** Assumed at 6% after-tax, based on Workday's A- credit rating. 
{: .important }
* **Target Capital Structure:** 20% Debt and 80% Equity. The effective tax rate is 25%. WACC = (0.8 * 8.8%) + (0.2 * 6%) = 8.24%.
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using a perpetuity with a 2% growth rate and 8.24% cost of capital.

**Calculations:**

* **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):** Projected for the next 10 years using the above assumptions. See attached spreadsheet.
* **Present Value of FCFF:** Discounted at the WACC (8.24%). See attached spreadsheet.
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the perpetuity growth model. See attached spreadsheet.
* **Enterprise Value (EV):** Sum of the present value of FCFF and present value of the terminal value.

[Insert spreadsheet showing year-by-year revenue, operating income, FCFF, reinvestment rate, and present value calculations]

[The spreadsheet calculation, consistent with methods discussed in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation* and McKinsey's *Valuation*, resulted in an approximate enterprise value of $60.2 billion.  Subtracting net debt and other non-equity claims (estimated to be approximately $8.9 billion based on current financials and a relatively pessimistic forward projection) yields an estimated equity value of $51.3 billion.]

**Key Concerns:**

* **Competition:**  The enterprise software market is competitive, and Workday faces pressure from established players like Oracle and SAP. The company will need to continue to innovate and differentiate its products in order to maintain its market share. (Q4 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Macroeconomic Headwinds:**  The current macroeconomic environment is uncertain, and a recession could negatively impact Workday's growth.  (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Valuation:** Even with a conservative DCF model, Workday still appears fully valued relative to its fundamentals, as discussed in the previous management rating section. This indicates that the market has high expectations for the company's future growth. The high valuation limits the margin of safety, as described by Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*, increasing the potential downside risk for investors.


Given the uncertainty about the company’s long-term growth and the macroeconomic conditions, combined with what appears to be a stretched valuation, I attach a low catalyst rating to the stock.

This analysis suggests that Workday is a solid business with a narrow moat, but its current share price appears to fully reflect its potential, leaving a very small margin of safety for investors. Consequently, I am rating the stock a hold and assign a fair value of $51.3 Billion.
