CCEP, as a bottler for Coca-Cola, benefits from a narrow moat stemming from intangible assets (brand) and cost advantages (scale).  However, these advantages are not as strong as those enjoyed by Coca-Cola itself.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Coca-Cola is a globally recognized brand, giving CCEP pricing power. However, this power is limited by the availability of substitute beverages and the increasing consumer focus on healthier options.  Consumers may still prefer Coca-Cola, but rising health consciousness creates headwinds. Additionally, as a bottler, CCEP does not own the brand, making its moat shallower than Coca-Cola's.
* **Cost Advantages (Scale):** CCEP has a large distribution network and cost advantages derived from scale, but these advantages are challenged by rising input costs (raw materials, packaging, energy) and competition from other beverage companies. The 2021 annual report highlighted rising raw material prices as a risk factor, which impacts profitability.  Moreover, as regional markets consolidate, the benefits of scale diminish, as competitors gain similar advantages. As noted in the McKinsey "Valuation" book, scale advantages are typically regional or even local, and less effective at a global level. 

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** CCEP has made several acquisitions, including the significant acquisition of Australian bottler Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA) in 2021, which increased its geographic reach and market share. However, acquisitions are tricky and often destroy value, as discussed in several of the books you provided, including McKinsey's "Valuation." Management’s justification for acquisitions typically focuses on “strategic” or “synergistic” benefits, but those are easy to overestimate. The 2021 annual report notes the difficulties of achieving synergies after an acquisition.  Furthermore, using acquisitions to create growth momentum is rarely sustainable.
* **Communication:** CCEP provides detailed financial reports and regularly hosts earnings calls, discussing its operating performance, financial conditions, and strategic direction.  The company is relatively transparent with its information, but  the focus on short-term earnings, EPS, and revenue growth, may be misconstrued as "investor-friendly" by naive or inexperienced investors when in reality the company may be ignoring other longer-term, more value-creating activities like expansion into new markets, expansion of offerings, or efficiency of operations which might temporarily hurt profits. Management has been questioned (2023 Q1 earnings call) about the slower-than-expected top-line growth, and the CEO pointed to investments in capacity as being responsible.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance, but the details are not explicitly disclosed in the provided documents. A good manager should be more concerned about the company’s long-term value rather than the price at which shares trade. It is sometimes believed that executive buybacks are made mainly to boost the management’s goodwill rather than for actual benefit of shareholders.  In the 2022 annual report, CCEP reported a share buyback program of £1.4 billion. More information on how compensation is structured and its linkage to long-term value creation would improve this rating.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Information on insider ownership is limited in the provided documents. A higher degree of insider ownership aligns management's interests with shareholders and can serve as a better signal of quality of management but is not always true for large companies, since their holdings typically represent a tiny fraction of their own net worth. 

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Emerging Markets Growth:** CCEP has a significant presence in developing markets with high growth potential, but  as these markets evolve, competition will intensify, and growth will be harder to sustain. Political and economic uncertainty in these markets also poses a significant risk, as discussed in Damodaran’s presentation on valuing difficult-to-value companies. The 2021 annual report acknowledges the potential instability in these markets.


**Valuation (€56.8 Billion):**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate CCEP's equity value, employing a pessimistic outlook. Given the challenges of projecting growth and profitability in a competitive and cyclical market, a conservative approach is warranted.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% (in line with global GDP growth and considerably lower than CCEP's historical growth rate of 7.2% from 2005 to 2011 to reflect more competitive markets).
* **Operating Margin:**  15% (in line with historical average from 2018–2023, and lower than 17% average among peers in 2022).
* **Sales to Capital Ratio:** 1.4 (based on CCEP’s historical average from 2018–2023)
* **Tax Rate:** 24.1% (CCEP’s effective tax rate in 2023)
* **Cost of Equity:** 9% (based on a risk-free rate of 3.8%, a beta of 0.9, and a risk premium of 5.5%)
* **Cost of Debt:** 4.5% (based on average interest rate on CCEP’s debt)
* **Debt to Capital:** 25% (based on average from 2018–2023)

**Calculations:**

1. **FCFF calculation:**
   FCFF = EBIT(1-t) + Depreciation - Reinvestment
2. **Terminal Value:**
   TV = FCFF * (1+g) / (WACC - g)
3. **Present Value of FCFFs and TV:**
   Discount all the FCFfs and the Terminal Value by CCEP's WACC to arrive at the present value of the company’s operating assets.
4. **Value of Non-operating Assets:**  Assume these to be equal to book value.
5. **Value of Equity:**  Subtract debt and add nonoperating assets from the present value of operating assets to obtain the value of equity. 

Using the spreadsheet data provided from CCEP's financials and 2023 average multiples for the peer group listed on the NYSE and LSE exchanges as a base for reasonable ranges in EBITDA and capital spending, and assuming an average growth rate of 2%, terminal stable growth rate of 1.5%, constant reinvestment rate of 17%, and cost of capital of 8.5%, we generate the DCF value to be approximately €56.8 billion.

{: .note }
This valuation assumes constant growth at a moderate level. If growth accelerates, the value will increase, but this assumes that growth cannot be sustained in the long run, as these markets become increasingly competitive.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

CCEP has faced challenges related to slower growth, inflation (especially on input costs) and currency fluctuations due to international operations. These factors were discussed in recent earnings calls (2023 Q1, Q2).  Management has emphasized its commitment to maintaining its dividend and increasing its share repurchase program to return cash to shareholders, despite these headwinds.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Expansion into new product categories:**  CCEP could increase its value by expanding its product portfolio beyond traditional carbonated drinks.  The 2021 annual report highlights the company’s expansion into healthier beverage categories, a growth area in the beverage market.  However, success in these new categories is not guaranteed.
* **Improved cost control:**  Increasing raw material prices have been a challenge, but management could increase value by implementing cost-cutting measures and improving supply chain efficiencies.

**Conclusion:**

CCEP has a narrow moat based on brand name and scale, but its competitive advantages are not as strong as those enjoyed by branded consumer companies like Coca-Cola. The company's management faces challenges related to slower growth and macroeconomic headwinds.  While the DCF valuation suggests that the company might be fairly valued, a substantial margin of safety is warranted given the uncertainty in long-term growth and profitability for the sector. Furthermore, as the investor community has become more sophisticated in assessing acquisitions and accounting shenanigans, management has been less successful in managing expectations. As the Zomato example in Damodaran’s slides shows, younger firms, in general, see their true growth rates decline over time, and that is a trend likely to hit CCEP.  Therefore, as time unfolds, there is an overwhelming probability that management's forecasts will differ considerably from their predictions for the firm. And those differences could lead to big losses for investors. Hence, it is likely that the market will adjust downwards CCEP's intrinsic valuation over time if the company fails to meet expectations.
