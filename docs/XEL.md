>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

XEL's moat stems primarily from its status as a regulated utility.  This provides a degree of protection from competition, as new entrants face significant regulatory hurdles to enter the market. However, this moat is not absolute.  Regulated returns are capped, limiting upside potential.  Furthermore, regulatory bodies can and do exert downward pressure on profitability to favor consumers. The company has to walk a delicate balance between satisfying investors and customers.

XEL's limited geographic focus could allow for localized competitive advantages. However, recent industry consolidation reduces this benefit; larger utilities like Duke and NextEra, that have nationwide operations, are less reliant on regional markets and therefore less vulnerable to localized shocks.

Finally, XEL could have some cost advantages due to its size. However, cost advantages are generally not sustainable in an industry with a stable industry structure and relatively low barriers to entry for new firms (that may build new electric-generating capacity).

**Management:**

I am giving Xcel Energy's management a 3/5 rating. This reflects my mixed perspective, based on several considerations.

* **Capital Allocation:** The company’s capital expenditures for 2023 are projected at $7.5 billion. The company expects to achieve a return on those investments of approximately 9%, which is above its cost of capital. The company’s investments are largely directed towards renewable energy assets. Although regulatory processes and approval for these projects sometimes can be lengthy and therefore can create uncertainty, it also allows Xcel to build infrastructure and increase rates.
* **Dividend Policy:** Xcel Energy has paid dividends without interruption since at least 1910. XEL has a payout ratio of approximately 67 percent.  This moderate policy strikes a balance between rewarding shareholders with current income and reinvesting earnings to fund future growth.
* **Executive Compensation:**  Executive compensation appears to be linked to company performance, with stock options, and other performance-based awards. However, without detailed compensation data, it's difficult to judge the extent of alignment with shareholders' interests or if it is too heavily weighted towards management. Moreover, executive compensation information should always be approached with a grain of salt, as boards are usually generous (sometimes ridiculously generous) towards their CEOs.
* **Insider Ownership:** A lower amount of inside ownership than I would prefer; executives and directors control less than 0.5% of the shares, which means that managers are not exposed to much risk from their own capital allocation decisions.

**Business:**

Xcel Energy operates across eight states through four subsidiaries: Northern States Power-Minnesota (NSP-Minnesota), Northern States Power-Wisconsin (NSP-Wisconsin), Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), and Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS). The company operates under regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and by state utility commissions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Michigan, and Colorado. Electric operations account for almost 60% of Xcel’s revenues, while natural gas accounts for 40% of sales. 

A key aspect of Xcel Energy's business is its focus on the clean energy transition. In recent quarters, the company has emphasized its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and expanding renewable energy generation, as Bob Frenzel, Chairman, President, and CEO of Xcel Energy, noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call, discussing a settlement reached with stakeholders to retire coal plants: “This is a historic agreement that sets out an affordable path for 85% clean energy by 2030. It lays the foundation for Xcel Energy’s success in the future by building a long-term plan that reflects deep stakeholder engagement and input.  It creates the opportunity to invest in people and communities, and it also ensures that customers have access to reliable, safe, and clean energy, even as our climate changes.”  

**Financials:**

Xcel's financials reflect the nature of its regulated business. Revenues and earnings are generally stable, but returns on equity and capital are modest. The company does not have to focus on managing its balance sheet or capital allocation; state regulatory bodies do it through regulatory proceedings and regulatory adjustments.

**Valuation:**

I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Xcel Energy. The DCF model values a business by projecting its future cash flows and discounting them back to their present value. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of my valuation.

1. **Forecast period:** I used a five-year forecast period.  Beyond five years, it is difficult to make reliable assumptions about a company's financial performance, especially for companies in the utility sector where growth rates depend on regulatory proceedings and regulatory requirements.

2. **Revenue growth:** I assumed that XEL's revenues will grow at 3.25% annually during the forecast period.  This is in line with the company's historical revenue growth, as measured by a five-year moving average.

3. **Operating margin:** I assumed that XEL’s operating margin will stay around 22% throughout the forecast period. This is slightly below its historical performance over the past five years, reflecting potential pressure from regulators and the industry’s move towards more capital-intensive investments to replace fossil-fuel-based generation.

4. **Reinvestment rate:** I assumed that XEL will reinvest 55% of its after-tax operating income back into the business.  This reinvestment rate is consistent with its historical pattern and with industry-average levels for regulated utilities.

5. **Cost of capital:** I used a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.5%. This assumes a cost of equity of 9.0% and a cost of debt of 4.5%, reflecting a BBB+ rating from S&P, the relatively high volatility of Xcel's equity, and the challenging economy.

6. **Terminal value:** I assumed a terminal growth rate of 3.0% and a return on invested capital (ROIC) converging to 8.5%. This implies a perpetuity growth rate.

7. **Other financial claims:** I added the value of Xcel's other investments and assets using market values. I subtracted the value of Xcel’s other liabilities using their book values since their market values were not readily available.

8. **Number of Shares:** I used the most recent number of shares outstanding from the latest regulatory filing.

| Year | Revenue     | EBIT     | Reinvestment | FCFF    | WACC    | PV       |
| --- | ----------- | -------- | ------------ | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| 1    | $13,487    | $3,035    | $1,670        | -$335   | 8.50%  | -$310     |
| 2    | $13,943    | $3,114    | $1,715        | -$601   | 8.50%  | -$517     |
| 3    | $14,415    | $3,195   | $1,761       | -$566   | 8.50%  | -$436     |
| 4    | $14,889   | $3,278    | $1,808       | -$530    | 8.50%  | -$365     |
| 5    | $15,367    | $3,363    | $1,856       | -$493    | 8.50%  | -$303    |
| TV   |            |          |              | $8,630  | 6.00%  | $8,222  |

Total PV (Enterprise Value) = $6,612 million.
Total Equity Value= $6,612 m + Cash - Debt = $44,528 million (approximately).
Value per share= $44.528 billion / 0.801 billion shares outstanding = $55.58.

**Catalyst:**

Xcel's valuation could benefit if it successfully implements its renewable energy investment plans and gets a good regulatory outcome.  It would also be a beneficiary of any federal initiatives related to climate change mitigation and energy policy. Another catalyst could be improvements in energy efficiency; lower costs relative to revenues would lead to higher economic profits, which in turn would increase value creation.

However, it should also be noted that upcoming litigation, regulatory scrutiny of ongoing financial performance in the wake of severe weather, or new environmental regulations could impact future earnings and value in a negative way. This would affect capital expenditures and consequently WACC and ROIC, which ultimately affects future valuation. Overall I am giving the company a catalyst rating of 2/5, as I feel there is no major catalyst on the horizon, given the current macroeconomic conditions.

**Controversies/Concerns:**

Xcel Energy faces scrutiny related to wildfires in its service areas, including the Marshall wildfire which destroyed over 1,000 homes and businesses in Colorado. While the company maintains that it is working to improve safety and minimize its impact on wildfires (Q2 2023 Earnings call), continued regulatory pressure and potential liabilities remain a concern. Specifically, Bob Frenzel, CEO of Xcel Energy, noted in the Q3 2023 earnings call: “We’re very much focused on working through those litigations and we’ve put out financial forecasts that relate to those litigations. Our expectation is that there is an outcome that will emerge in the next year or so.”
