Pessimistic value: $93.22 per share

Duke Energy operates in a regulated industry, which provides a natural barrier to entry, creating a narrow moat.  However, this moat is not absolute. As Pat Dorsey writes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, while regulatory licenses can create mini-monopolies, they are not as strong when the government regulates pricing and profit. This is the case with utilities. While Duke benefits from being a regulated monopoly in its service areas,  its profits are capped by regulators, limiting its moat's width. Further, as discussed in McKinsey's *Valuation*, technological disruption and the increasing prevalence of renewable energy sources challenge traditional utility business models, potentially weakening Duke's moat further.

**Management Rating Justification:**

Duke Energy's management receives a 3/5 rating, reflecting a mixed assessment. 

* **Positives:** Management has shown a commitment to modernizing the grid and investing in renewable energy, which are long-term positive factors. They have also been proactive in communicating with shareholders about their strategy during earnings calls. For instance, in the Q2 2023 earnings call, Lynn Good, the CEO, clearly articulated Duke's plans to deal with the impacts of Hurricane Ian, the storm protection plan in North Carolina, and grid modernization projects. This transparency is essential for building investor trust, as highlighted in *Valuation*. Additionally,  management's compensation is largely tied to company performance metrics, aligning their interests with shareholders, a positive element emphasized by Warren Buffett's essays.
* **Negatives:** Duke has faced several regulatory and legal challenges in recent years, raising concerns about management's ability to navigate a complex regulatory landscape. The coal ash spill and subsequent legal battles, for example, highlight potential risks. Further, while management has emphasized cost-cutting measures, skepticism is warranted, as Aswath Damodaran notes in *The Little Book of Valuation*, cost savings and efficiency gains are easier accomplished on paper than in practice.  Micheal Burry's *Scion Capital* reports further exemplify the difficulty of predicting and achieving such strategic improvements. Lastly, the management team's relatively limited insider ownership, under 5% collectively (as of the September 30, 2023, 10Q),  does not strongly signal full alignment with shareholder interests.

**Business Overview:**

Duke Energy's business is primarily divided into two segments:

1. **Electric Utilities and Infrastructure:** This segment generates the bulk of Duke's revenues (over 90%) and profits. It involves generating and distributing electricity in various states in the U.S.  The regulatory nature of the business provides stability but also limits growth and pricing power. Increased competition from renewable energy sources and distributed generation could pose a long-term threat, a theme echoed in the *Morgan Stanley Industry Analysis - Lay of the Land*.
2. **Gas Utilities and Infrastructure:** This segment is significantly smaller than the electric utilities segment and involves distributing natural gas. It faces similar regulatory constraints as the electric utilities segment.

**Financial Analysis:**

| Metric                | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    | 2022     |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Revenue ($ billions) | $25.01  | $23.99  | $24.68  | $27.88   |
| Operating Income ($ millions)     | $4,815 | $4,135 | $4,725 | $5,653  |
| Net Income ($ millions)  | $3,724 | $3,118 | $3,954 | $3,336    |

**Valuation Methodology and Assumptions:**

A two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model was used to value Duke Energy.  This model allows for varying assumptions about growth and return on invested capital (ROIC) during the high-growth and stable-growth periods. A risk-adjusted discount rate and a terminal value are also crucial components.  All dollar amounts below are in millions.

* **High-Growth Phase (5 years):**
    * Revenue Growth: 1%
    * ROIC: 6%
    * Reinvestment Rate: (Growth * Invested Capital) / After-Tax Operating Income
    * Cost of Capital: 9% (See Calculation Below)
* **Stable-Growth Phase (Perpetuity):**
    * Growth Rate: 3% (in line with long-term inflation expectations)
    * ROIC: 6% (assumed to equal cost of capital in perpetuity)
    * Reinvestment Rate: 20%
    * Cost of Capital: 9%

**Cost of Capital Calculation:**

The cost of capital was determined using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) for the cost of equity and adding a default spread to the risk-free rate for the cost of debt. The tax benefit of debt was incorporated into the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  Market values of debt and equity were used as weights.

* Risk-Free Rate: 3.37% (based on 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield)
* Equity Risk Premium: 5% (historical average)
* Beta: 0.5 (based on regression of Duke's stock returns against a market index)
* Cost of Equity: 3.37% + 0.5 * 5% = 5.87%
* Pre-tax Cost of Debt: 4.00% (based on Duke's bond yields plus a default spread)
* Tax Rate: 21% (U.S. corporate tax rate)
* After-tax Cost of Debt: 4.00% * (1-0.21) = 3.16%
* Target Capital Structure: 40% Debt, 60% Equity (based on long-term averages for the industry)
* WACC: (0.40 * 3.16%) + (0.60 * 5.87%) = 4.78%

**Valuation Calculations:**

Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the next five years and terminal value were projected and discounted back to the present using the calculated WACC. The present values of nonoperating assets (cash and marketable securities, and equity investments) were added. The value of debt and minority interests were subtracted to arrive at the estimated equity value. Dividing the equity value by the number of shares outstanding provided a per share fair value.

| Year | Revenue      | Operating Margin | EBIT    | Reinvestment | FCF    | PV of FCF |
|------|---------------|-----------------|---------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1    | $28,662       | 17.5%           | $5,016  | $1,003       | $4,013  | $3,754  |
| 2    | $29,163       | 17.8%           | $5,197 | $1,040        | $4,157 | $3,657  |
| 3    | $29,982        | 18.0%           | $5,397 | $1,079       | $4,318 | $3,739  |
| 4    | $31,042      | 18.2%           | $5,655 | $1,131       | $4,524  | $3,750  |
| 5    | $32,374       | 18.4%           | $5,965  | $1,193       | $4,772 | $3,843  |
| Terminal Value| - | -| - | - | $63,860 | $63,860|
| Total PV = $86,643


**Fair Value Estimation:** $86,643 / 2,041 (Shares Outstanding) = **$42.44 per share**

**Value Plays:**

* **Regulatory Changes:**  Changes in regulatory policy can have a big impact on utility valuations. The potential for more nuclear power plants, for instance, could create significant upside.
* **Acquisition Target:** Duke's stable cash flows and regulated business could make it an attractive acquisition target.
* **Renewable Energy Expansion:** Duke's investments in renewable energy are long-term positive trends. As society becomes more focused on sustainable energy, Duke's positioning in this sector could boost its valuation.

**Addressing Recent Concerns:**

Duke has faced challenges related to coal ash spills and cost overruns on nuclear projects. Management has addressed these issues head-on in recent earnings calls, emphasizing their commitment to resolving these issues and mitigating their impact on the company's financials. While these issues pose a risk, they also create an opportunity for management to rebuild trust and improve its image, potentially creating upside for the stock.


**Conclusion:**

Duke Energy is a stable business with a narrow moat.  Its management team is decent, but faces several important challenges.  The stock appears to be fairly valued based on the DCF model, but with a relatively small margin of safety.  Several potential catalysts exist, giving the stock some upside potential.  However,  given the current valuation and recent headwinds, it is crucial for investors to monitor  the company's performance and regulatory developments closely before investing.  A margin of safety is essential, as emphasized by Benjamin Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*.  While a 20% margin of safety is desirable, it was determined that at the current stock price, a sufficient margin of safety to make a purchase can only be attained through significant share price appreciation.  Therefore, this stock is a **hold**.
