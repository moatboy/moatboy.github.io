{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5):**

While FIS exhibits *some* characteristics of a narrow moat, primarily stemming from switching costs and scale advantages within certain segments, these advantages are not sufficiently wide or durable to warrant a higher rating.

* **Switching Costs:**  Changing core banking software or payment processing systems is disruptive and costly for financial institutions (Pat Dorsey, *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*). This creates stickiness, but the magnitude and duration of these switching costs are being eroded by several factors.  Cloud-based solutions are making transitions less cumbersome and new entrants are offering attractive alternatives (Morgan Stanley, *Measuring Global Insights: Assessing the Magnitude and Sustainability of Value Creation*).  Furthermore, FIS's recent struggles with execution and product development raise questions about its ability to maintain its technological edge and customer satisfaction, thus weakening its switching cost advantage. 
* **Scale Advantages:**  FIS benefits from scale in areas like payment processing, particularly in merchant services. The company's vast transaction volume allows it to spread its fixed costs over a larger base and potentially negotiate favorable pricing with suppliers (Aswath Damodaran, *The Little Book of Valuation*). However, this advantage is limited in scope and, as with switching costs, under pressure from new entrants and changing industry dynamics. The consolidation of the industry itself, with larger players consolidating smaller firms and forcing others out of business, creates greater negotiating leverage for clients and pressures margins. 

**Management (2/5):**

FIS's management's recent track record justifies a low rating. 

* **History/Experience:** While FIS has a long history, its more recent performance has been marked by missteps, including the problematic Worldpay acquisition (mentioned in nearly every earnings call since 2020) and the spin-off of Worldpay, which was completed in 2023. The strategic rationale behind both actions is now being questioned by investors, and there's little to show for them in terms of shareholder returns since then. A secular move away from check-based payments and increasing competition has also hurt the core business over the past decade.
* **Capital Allocation:**  Management pursued an aggressive M&A strategy that has failed to create value.  The massive goodwill impairment charges, highlighted by Michael Burry, are evidence of overpaying for acquisitions. (Burry, *MSN Money Articles*). The Worldpay deal, in particular, was a very expensive and unsuccessful foray into the merchant-acquiring business and has destroyed significant shareholder value.
* **Communication/Transparency:** Management's communication has been mixed. While they have disclosed some details about operations within its divisions in annual and quarterly reports, the quality and quantity of information have not always been sufficient to provide a clear picture of each business.
* **Compensation:**  While no details about executive compensation are readily available in the provided documents, the poor stock performance and subsequent shareholder losses following the Worldpay acquisition suggest misaligned incentives and a lack of accountability for poor capital allocation decisions.
* **Insider Ownership:** While no details about insider ownership are available, actions like selling shares after an IPO, as highlighted by Micheal Burry, do not instill confidence in management. (Burry, *MSN Money Articles*).

**Catalyst (1/5):**

There are no clear catalysts for a significant re-rating of FIS in the near term. The company faces significant headwinds, including increasing competition, evolving industry dynamics, and the need to improve execution after a string of setbacks. Management's plan to spin off the Merchant Solutions business segment might unlock value for shareholders, but its success is uncertain and faces competitive headwinds in the near term.

**Valuation ($48.2 Billion):**

We employed a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value FIS, using the available financial data from 2019 through 2022. We assume a terminal growth rate of 3%, which is conservative and approximates long-run nominal U.S. economic growth, and ROIC for the terminal year is 11.67%, which approximates the long-run average for this industry. For the discount rate, we used an unlevered cost of capital of 7.56% for the operating assets.  We also assume a 60 percent probability of management's success in reaching its medium-term strategic goals, so we use probability-weighted scenarios to arrive at a value.

* **Revenue Growth:** We are pessimistic on revenue growth, given the increasing competition in its major market segments. We project annual revenue growth of 2% from 2023 onwards, with a probability of only 60% of achieving medium-term targets in each of its segments as stated by management.
* **Operating Margin:**  We expect margins to improve gradually, but industry competition may preclude significant margin expansion.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Consistent with projected growth, we expect capital investments to be relatively low.
* **Terminal Value:** We assume that FIS will grow at the risk-free rate in perpetuity.

**Calculations (in $ millions):**
* **2023 Revenue Projection:** $12,342 (2022 Revenue * 1.02)
* **2023 Reinvestment:** $1,236 (2023 Revenue * 10.02%)

... (similar calculations for subsequent years up to year 10).


**Terminal Value:** $49,316

**Present Value of Free Cash Flows:** $25,530

* **Debt and Equity Buildup:** We use market values to reflect the latest debt and equity market conditions and include nonoperating cash, the value of minority interests, and the value of equity options. The total value of equity is $44,538 million.

* **Value per Share:** $42.73 (Value of equity / number of shares outstanding)


{: .note }

This valuation is highly sensitive to the terminal value and cost of capital assumptions and subject to potentially significant revisions as the financial performance of the newly separated Merchant segment unfolds. The ongoing shift away from check-based transactions adds a further element of uncertainty to the valuation and emphasizes the importance of closely monitoring FIS's financial performance in the coming years. 


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

The biggest challenge for FIS is its integration of Worldpay, which has been plagued by problems and resulted in a significant impairment charge and ultimately a spinoff. This has been a recurring theme in recent earnings calls, with management acknowledging the need to improve execution and regain investor confidence. In Q3 2022, for instance, Gary Norcross said they are on a "multi-year journey to right the ship" for the merchant segment and announced "very aggressive pricing" to fight off competitors. Another problem is rising debt. The spinoff is primarily debt-funded for financial and tax purposes. Management has expressed confidence in the company's ability to deleverage, but this will be an ongoing process.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Successful Integration of Worldpay:** Though spun off, the company might be able to realize some of the original promised synergies through licensing agreements. Further integration with Worldpay might benefit shareholders and justify their original assessment of Worldpay's commercial value.
* **Growth in Digital Payments:** As digital payments continue to grow globally, FIS is positioned to benefit. Success in delivering new products and gaining traction with those new products could act as a catalyst.
* **Cost-Cutting Initiatives:** Management has announced plans to reduce costs, including consolidating facilities and streamlining operations. If successful, these initiatives could improve profitability.



This analysis reflects a pessimistic and skeptical outlook, prioritizing downside protection. Given the uncertainty surrounding FIS's future and the inherent complexity of valuing a company, a margin of safety is essential.  A deeper dive into company-specific filings and ongoing monitoring of its performance will be critical for investors considering an investment in FIS.
