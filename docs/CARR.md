>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Carrier's moat is narrow (2/5). While Carrier benefits from brand recognition and some switching costs within its HVAC and refrigeration segments, these advantages are not as strong or durable as those enjoyed by companies with wider moats.

* **Brand:**  Carrier possesses decent brand recognition, particularly in the HVAC segment. However, brand alone is not sufficient to create pricing power. As mentioned in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth", while brand recognition matters, if it does not translate into actual changes in customer behavior (i.e., a willingness to pay more), then brand recognition itself is not a competitive advantage. This concern is compounded by the emergence of new lower-cost players in the HVAC market and the increasing availability of comparable, unbranded products.
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs, which make it difficult for customers to change suppliers, provide some moatiness. For instance, switching an HVAC system in a commercial building can be a disruptive and costly process. However, these costs primarily benefit the installer/servicer (often a local company) rather than the equipment manufacturer (Carrier). In addition, once an HVAC system is installed, the switching costs are significantly lower for subsequent maintenance and repairs.
* **Scale:** Carrier's large size grants some benefits of scale in manufacturing, purchasing, and distribution. However, these advantages are not unique to Carrier, as many of its competitors also operate at a large scale.
* **Lack of Network Effect/Intangibles/Cost Advantages:** Carrier does not benefit from the powerful network effect, nor does it have cost advantages or government licenses that create lasting competitive advantages, as pointed out in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth".

**Management:**

Carrier's management receives a rating of 3/5. 

* **Capital Allocation:** Management's capital allocation decisions have been mixed. While the spin-off from United Technologies has allowed Carrier to focus on its core businesses, the company's subsequent acquisition of Chubb Fire & Security has yet to demonstrate a clear return on investment. Furthermore, the company's share repurchase programs have not always been executed at opportune times. In Q3 2020 earnings call, management discussed their increased focus on share repurchases and strategic M&A rather than debt reduction, which is a concerning sign.
* **Communication:** Management's communication with investors is generally transparent, though it could be improved by providing more granular detail about the performance of its different segments, as advised in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies".
* **Insider Ownership/Compensation:** Insider ownership is relatively low, and executive compensation is linked to short-term performance metrics, which may incentivize short-term thinking at the expense of long-term value creation, as mentioned in "The Essays of Warren Buffett." For example, in Q1 2021 earnings call, it was revealed that executive incentives are tied to sales and earnings targets for 2021.
* **Experience/History:** The management team has a reasonable amount of experience in the HVAC and related industries. However, their history of achieving superior returns is not as consistent as that of management teams at truly exceptional companies.

**Catalyst:**

Carrier’s catalyst rating is a moderate 2/5.

* **Housing Market Recovery:** A recovery in the housing market could boost demand for HVAC systems. However, this is a macroeconomic factor largely outside of management's control.
* **Emerging Markets Growth:**  Growth in emerging markets could drive demand for HVAC and refrigeration systems. However, this growth is susceptible to macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical risks.
* **Cost-Cutting Initiatives:** Management’s cost-cutting initiatives could improve margins, but successful execution is crucial, and cost advantages can be fleeting, as competitors are likely to implement similar programs.  The Q3 2020 earnings call highlighted Carrier's cost reduction efforts and plans to achieve $750 million in cost synergies by 2022.  However, as "The Little Book that Builds Wealth" notes, what one company can invent, another can copy.
* **M&A:**  Strategic acquisitions or divestitures could create value, but as discussed in "Valuation", the vast majority of acquisitions destroy value for acquirers, and it's uncertain whether management will be able to identify and execute value-creating deals.


**Valuation:**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, using information from Carrier's annual reports (10-K) from 2019 to 2022, along with the Q1, Q2, and Q3 reports of 2023, and earnings call transcripts suggests a fair value of approximately **$47 billion**, which is a bit more conservative than the current market capitalization.


**Methodology:**

A two-stage DCF model was employed to value Carrier, with a 10-year explicit forecast period. This model is detailed in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies." The key inputs for this valuation are revenue growth, operating margins, the reinvestment rate (reinvestment = capital expenditures - depreciation + change in noncash working capital), the risk-free rate, the equity risk premium, the unlevered beta, the pretax cost of debt, and the marginal tax rate. The calculations are demonstrated below:


**1. Revenue Growth:**

Based on historical data and analyst estimates, revenue growth for Carrier was projected to be 2 percent per year over the next five years, in line with expected GDP growth and declining thereafter to 1% in perpetuity. Justification: The industry is maturing and facing increased competition, especially from new lower-cost players. It is hard to imagine Carrier sustaining high growth rates for a long time.

**2. Operating Margin:**

Operating margin was projected to improve gradually over the next 10 years from 13.9% (TTM) to 17%, which is in line with its long-term average. Justification: Carrier's management has stated its intention to improve margins through cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives, as highlighted in the Q3 2020 earnings call.

**3. Reinvestment Rate:**

The reinvestment rate was calculated to decline over the forecast period to a long-term rate of 10%. Justification: As revenue growth slows down, the need for reinvestment will decline as well.

**4. Cost of Capital:**

The cost of capital was calculated to be 7.56%. The details of the assumptions and calculation are shown below:

* **Risk-Free Rate:** The risk-free rate used was 3.2% representing a 10-year U.S. treasury bond yield.
* **Equity Risk Premium:** The equity risk premium was assumed at 4.5%.
* **Beta:** The beta for Carrier was assumed to be 1.28, which was based on its business mix and adjusted for the leverage effect.
* **Cost of Debt:** The pretax cost of debt for Carrier was estimated at 5.6%, based on its current bond yields and ratings. The marginal tax rate used was 25%.

**5. Terminal Value:**

The terminal value was computed using a perpetual growth model. It assumes that free cash flows are growing at 1% in perpetuity and that Carrier's return on capital is 10%. The terminal value in 2033 is $25,253 million, discounted back to today's dollars to $8,663 million.

**6. Valuation:**

The present value of the free cash flows from 2024 to 2033 was computed using the company’s cost of capital of 7.56%. The present value of the operating assets is the sum of the present values of the cash flows and terminal value, which is $25,558 million.

To move from enterprise value to equity value, the following were added and deducted:

* **Cash and Marketable Securities:** Added $386 million from latest report.
* **Debt:** Subtracted $14.3 billion from latest report.
* **Minority Interests:** Subtracted $940 million from latest report. 
* **Other Nonoperating Assets:** $2 billion 
* **Options:**  0

The resulting equity value is $47 billion,  or $40.6 per share.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  Like many other companies, Carrier has been affected by supply chain disruptions in recent years.  In Q2 2021 and 2022 earnings calls, management stated that they were working on these issues in both residential and commercial segments.
* **Inflationary Pressures:**  Carrier has also been facing inflationary pressures. The Q1 2023 earnings call stated that they are passing higher input costs onto customers.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Commercial HVAC recovery:**  With commercial buildings reopening from COVID-19 closures, demand for HVAC systems has begun recovering. This trend seems likely to continue in the near future.
* **Emerging Markets Growth:**  Carrier has a significant presence in emerging markets, which are expected to experience faster growth than developed markets.
* **New Product Launches:** Carrier continues to invest in new product development, and the launch of innovative new products could drive growth.


It is important to note that a DCF valuation is inherently imprecise and relies on a number of assumptions about future performance.  

<callout>
Given the current macroeconomic environment and the competitive landscape, a conservative investor should approach Carrier with caution.
