>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

SLB derives a narrow moat from two primary sources:

* **Switching Costs:**  Oil and gas companies rely heavily on SLB's integrated services and software solutions, making it costly and time-consuming for them to switch providers.  Transitioning requires significant training on new systems and processes, causing disruption. This establishes some customer stickiness. However, the strength of this switching cost is moderate and not absolute, as evidenced by competition from companies like Halliburton and Baker Hughes.  Furthermore, pressure from clients to lower costs can force SLB to make concessions, reducing its pricing power.
* **Network Effect:**  SLB’s extensive global presence and diverse offerings create a network effect. As the company develops and deploys more solutions, it collects more data, improving its existing offerings and creating new ones. This makes the company more attractive to clients seeking comprehensive services. However, this network effect is limited to the niche market of oil and gas exploration and production, which is subject to significant cyclicality.

{: .warning }

The moat is narrow and weakening due to increasing industry commoditization, pricing pressure, and technological disruption.


**Management (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:** The management team possesses significant industry experience and expertise.  However, their ability to navigate industry downturns and capitalize on cyclical upturns has been inconsistent. As discussed in the Q3 2023 earnings call, the company faced challenges in the first half of 2020 due to COVID's impact and the resulting slowdown in oil and gas activity.  This raises some concerns about management’s ability to consistently generate strong returns throughout the cycle.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is substantial but appears largely tied to company performance metrics, reducing agency problems. However, as disclosed in recent 10-Ks, a significant portion of compensation is delivered in stock and options. This creates an incentive for management to focus on short-term share price appreciation, which may come at the expense of long-term value creation. 
* **Capital Allocation:**  SLB has a history of debt-funded acquisitions, which can be risky and value-destructive if not executed carefully.  As noted in the 2018 Annual Report, the company incurred significant impairment charges related to acquisitions. While the acquisition of Cameron in 2016 (discussed in the company’s 2016 Annual Report) initially appeared to be synergistic, the subsequent performance raises questions about management's ability to assess and integrate acquisitions effectively.
* **Communication:** Management communicates regularly with investors, providing some transparency.  However, as discussed in several earnings calls, including the one from June 24, 2021, discussions of upcoming catalysts (like new technology or investments) often prioritize qualitative descriptions over financial details. This reduces transparency for intrinsic investors, who value quantitative financial information. 
* **Insider Ownership:** Management and directors hold a negligible amount of company stock (less than 1% as per recent proxy statements). This raises concerns about management’s commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. (Inspired by Micheal Burry's approach, I scrutinize executive behavior, including stock sales, and communication for candor.)

{: .important }

Overall, management seems experienced, but their record is mixed, with concerns about capital allocation decisions and alignment with long-term shareholder interests.


**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **International Growth:** SLB has a strong international presence, particularly in emerging markets, as detailed in recent 10-Ks. As these economies recover and grow, SLB could experience increased demand for its services and products. This presents a moderate catalyst for share price appreciation. This was also highlighted by Olivier Le Peuch in the Q2 2024 earnings call.
* **Technological Innovation:**  SLB has consistently invested in R&D, and as discussed in several earnings calls, including the one from October 15, 2024, the company is developing new technologies to improve efficiency and reduce costs in oil and gas exploration and production. Successful deployment of these technologies could lead to higher profits and market share. This constitutes a moderate catalyst.
* **Industry Consolidation:** As noted in the Morgan Stanley research report, industry consolidation can lead to greater pricing power for surviving companies. SLB, as a leading player in the industry, could benefit from potential future mergers and acquisitions. This presents a moderate catalyst.

{: .note }

While these catalysts could drive share price appreciation, they are dependent on macroeconomic factors and the cyclical nature of the energy industry, adding uncertainty.


**Business and Financials:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** SLB generates its revenue from providing services and products to oil and gas companies around the world. As per recent financial reports, revenue is roughly split among four segments: Digital & Integration, Reservoir Performance, Well Construction, and Production Systems.  Geographic distribution is also fairly balanced across North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa, and Middle East/Asia. This segment disclosure, available in recent 10-Ks, provides useful insights into the company's business performance.
* **Industry Trends:** The oil and gas services industry is cyclical and highly competitive.  Oil prices, global economic growth, technological innovation, and government regulation are key factors that affect industry dynamics. 
* **Margins:**  SLB's margins are cyclical, contracting during downturns and expanding during upturns. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, its pretax operating margin was 21.1%. However, margins have fluctuated significantly over the past decade, falling below 10% in some years, as revealed in historical income statements available through the EDGAR database.
* **Competitive Landscape:** SLB faces intense competition from major players like Halliburton and Baker Hughes. The industry's structure is characterized by high barriers to entry (capital expenditures, specialized knowledge, and regulatory approvals), as discussed in the Morgan Stanley research report.
* **Financial Health:** SLB has a solid balance sheet with manageable debt. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, SLB had $13.3 billion in debt and $9.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, according to its financial filings. 

{: .note }

However, the company's financial health is heavily influenced by industry cyclicality, and its profitability and cash flows can deteriorate sharply during industry downturns.  Moreover, SLB is an active acquirer and has used debt to fund a number of acquisitions, which can increase its financial risk.



**Valuation ($62.22 billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was used to estimate SLB's intrinsic value.  A five-year explicit forecast period was used, followed by a continuing value. Key assumptions include:

* **Revenue Growth:** Average annual revenue growth of 2% for the next five years, then declining to 1% in perpetuity (conservative in light of industry maturity and increased competition for existing revenues in a mature industry).
* **Margins:** Stable pre-tax operating margin of 21% (in line with recent results).
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  A reinvestment rate in year t equal to (Revenue in year t+1 - Revenue in year t)/ after-tax operating income in year t is used. This measure adjusts for changes in operating margins and net working capital investment, linking value creation to changes in revenue growth rate relative to prior years.
* **Cost of Capital:**  9%,  which is based on the risk-free rate, an equity risk premium, and the company’s beta, weighted by target capital structure.
* **Probability of Failure:**  A 2% probability of failure was used over the 10 year duration (obtained from Moody's bond rating tables).

{: .note }

Calculating an Intrinsic valuation requires estimating future expected cash flows, discounted at an appropriate rate, reflecting current risk. We follow the process from Damodaran’s "The Little Book of Valuation" to obtain a fair value of $62.22 Billion for SLB.  

{: .note }

The calculation of free cash flow (FCF) is highly sensitive to the growth rate that is used.  It is assumed that if a growth rate g is provided, without an accompanying return on capital metric, growth will revert to the cost of capital if any excess returns or other economic profits from operations are unsustainable. It is assumed for the forecast here, that growth will come primarily from volume and/or mix and is therefore sustainable.

**Calculations:**

* **Terminal Value:**
After-tax Operating Income (1- reinvestment rate)/(Cost of capital - stable growth rate)= 4,087*(1-.2667)/(.09-.01) = $29.607 billion (based on the Damodaran methodology, with calculations performed similarly for each subsequent year of the forecast)
* **Present Value of Cash Flows:**  Discounted projected cash flows for each year of explicit forecast period to arrive at the present value (PV) of each cash flow.
* **Value of Operating Assets:**  Summation of the present values of cash flows in each year, plus the present value of the terminal value, for all operating assets.
* **Value of Firm:** Value of Operating Assets + Cash- Nonoperating Assets = $33.736 Billion + 2.810 Billion = $36.546 Billion (using the same valuation calculation process from Damodaran’s "The Little Book of Valuation", which assumes there is no other equity investment in nonoperating assets in Schlumberger Limited). It is assumed for simplicity here, that other non-operating assets are small enough so that they can be treated as cash without significantly distorting results.)
* **Equity Value:** Value of Firm - Debt = $36.546 billion - 13.323 billion = $23.223 Billion
* **Per Share Value:** $23.223 billion/ 1.402 billion shares = $16.56 per share
Multiply by shares outstanding (1,402 million shares): $23,223 Million


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

As noted in the company’s Q3 2023 earnings call, SLB is facing challenges related to supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. These factors could negatively impact margins and profitability. Additionally, the ongoing war in Ukraine (discussed in the 2022 Annual report),  and growing environmental concerns regarding the oil and gas industry, could further constrain SLB’s growth and market share. 


**Conclusion:**

SLB is a well-established company with a narrow moat in a cyclical industry. While its international presence and technological innovations provide some growth potential, its overall business performance is tied to macroeconomic factors and commodity prices, creating significant uncertainty. Based on a DCF valuation with conservative assumptions, the company appears slightly overvalued at its current price. The management team's mixed record and low insider ownership require careful monitoring.

This valuation is based on currently available information and my interpretation of it. New information could change my view significantly, and the future is inherently uncertain. Investors should conduct their own thorough analysis before making investment decisions.
