*   **Smaller, niche providers:** smaller providers, many focused on particular segments or niche markets, such as clinical research.

**What Makes Wolters Kluwer Different?**
{: .note }
Wolters Kluwer has carved out a defensible position in several key markets.

*   **Integrated Workflow Solutions:** Their offerings are designed to be deeply integrated into clients’ workflows, creating high switching costs.
*   **Longstanding Client Relationships:** Strong, deep relationships with long standing clients.
*   **Comprehensive Information:** Wolters Kluwer provides comprehensive data across its multiple segments, giving its products a competitive advantage.

**Moat Analysis:**

*   **Intangible Assets (Brands and Regulatory Approvals):** While Wolters Kluwer doesn’t have strong brand name recognition in the general public, its reputation among specialized users and within its various industries is significant.  Their strong brand recognition within their specific industries results in strong pricing power.   They also have regulatory approvals that offer some, though not insurmountable, advantages over smaller competitors.
*   **Switching Costs:** Once implemented, Wolters Kluwer's integrated software and information solutions become deeply ingrained in a client’s operations, creating a high cost and inertia to switch to alternative solutions.
*   **Network Effects:** They operate networks connecting buyers and sellers which can provide value for their users as the number of users increases.

**Moat Rating: 3/5**

*   While there are powerful moats within individual industries, they aren’t as entrenched as companies who have very strong network effects. Further, although their offerings are important for legal and compliance, the core services are not absolutely critical for business survival as a whole. This gives a rating of a 3 out of 5. 

**Legitimate Risks That Could Harm the Moat and Business Resilience:**

*   **Technological Disruption:** Disruption from new technology can potentially disrupt the business as their systems may become out of date.
*   **Increased Competition:** Increasing competition can decrease profitability. The company needs to continuously innovate to stay ahead of competition, and also needs to prevent smaller competitors from eating into its market share.
*   **Economic Sensitivity:** While their services may seem essential, prolonged downturns can cause firms to cut on expenses and lead to weaker profits in this sector.
*   **Client Consolidation:** In certain industries, consolidation can decrease their customer’s bargaining power, and lead to pricing pressure on the company.
