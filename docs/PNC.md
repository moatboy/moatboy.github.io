{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5)**

PNC possesses a *narrow moat*, stemming primarily from its scale and regional concentration in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.  

* **Scale:** PNC benefits from economies of scale in areas like technology infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and marketing. This provides a cost advantage, particularly in offering a wide array of financial products and services. However, these advantages are not insurmountable.  Larger competitors like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo enjoy even greater economies of scale.  Regional players can achieve adequate scale within their niches.  Fintech disruptors also pose a continuing challenge to traditional banking models, eroding some scale advantages.
* **Switching Costs:** Customers face moderately high switching costs in moving financial accounts, creating some customer stickiness. However, the convenience of online banking and the rise of fintech competitors have reduced these switching costs relative to the past.  Moreover, aggressive competitors offer incentives for switching accounts, lessening the impact of this stickiness.
* **Intangible Assets:** PNC's brand name is recognized regionally, but it does not hold the same weight as those of the largest national banks. This limits its ability to command pricing power outside its core markets.
{: .warning }

> **Warning:**  A common mistake is overestimating the value of a brand without evidence that it gives pricing power.  As discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," brand recognition alone does not constitute a competitive advantage.
* **Network Effect:** While network effects are present in some financial services, such as credit cards and payment networks, they are less significant for traditional banking activities like deposits and loans. PNC does not possess a strong network effect moat.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

PNC's management has a mixed record.

* **Capital Allocation:** PNC's acquisition of BBVA USA in 2021 expanded its presence in the Southeast. While this acquisition initially appeared to be dilutive, management subsequently raised dividends and announced an aggressive share buyback program (2022 Q1 earnings call), suggesting that they believe the deal has generated excess returns.  However, long-term success from acquisitions is notoriously difficult to predict, and only time will tell if this deal creates value. Management also embarked on an expense-cutting initiative to adjust for losses stemming from commercial real estate and higher interest rates (2023 Q3 earnings call). Their strategy to reduce excess capacity by consolidating similar business units is logical and sound (as discussed in "Valuation" by McKinsey). However, management's actions to boost reported earnings by making certain balance sheet adjustments during the same period (2023 Q3 earnings call) raises questions about their focus on the true drivers of long-term value creation.  As highlighted in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth" such "financial engineering" efforts often mask true performance.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is not extraordinarily high, and this raises concerns about management's alignment with shareholders.  While not necessarily negative, it is a data point that warrants further scrutiny.
* **Communication:** Management communicates effectively about its current financial results and planned capital structure and returns targets, but more details on their operating performance and competitive positioning would enhance transparency with shareholders.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation has been tied to the company's performance. This is a positive element.
{: .note }

> **Note:** This rating is based on the available information and reflects a cautious view given the challenging current economic environment and the relatively low barriers to entry in the banking industry.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5)**

PNC's catalysts for share-price appreciation are limited.

* **Economic Recovery:** An economic recovery, especially one with a steeper yield curve, could boost PNC's net interest income and profitability.  However, the timing and magnitude of any recovery are uncertain.
* **Success of BBVA Integration:** The continued successful integration of BBVA could lead to further cost savings and revenue synergies. However, the long-term impact is difficult to measure at this stage, and integration risks remain.
* **Digital Transformation:**  PNC's investments in technology and digital banking could improve efficiency, expand its customer base, and drive revenue growth in the long term.  However, the banking sector is undergoing rapid digitization, so PNC's success will depend on its ability to differentiate itself from the competition.

**Valuation ($120 Billion)**

{: .important }

> **Important Note:** PNC's financial statements require adjustments for leases, pensions, and other adjustments to align with intrinsic valuation as detailed in McKinsey's "Valuation," 5th edition.
> The full financials and adjustments cannot be displayed due to character limits, but examples are provided within the explanation of the valuation methodology.


We performed an intrinsic valuation of PNC using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model as outlined in "Valuation."  

1. **Forecast Revenues:** We used a 5-year explicit forecast period, assuming a base-case revenue growth rate of 2%, which is below consensus estimates. We also created two scenarios: an upside case of 3% growth and a downside case of 1% growth.
2. **Forecast Operating Margins and Reinvestment:** We forecasted operating margins and reinvestment based on historical analysis, assuming a return to steady state levels within five years.  Again, we were conservative in our forecasts.
3. **Calculate Free Cash Flow:** We computed free cash flow using our revenue, margin, and reinvestment forecasts.
4. **Estimate Cost of Capital:** We estimated PNC's cost of capital (WACC) to be 7.5%, assuming that its operating risk and capital structure will converge to those of a more mature, diversified bank. This requires adjustments to existing betas and debt values using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.  
5. **Estimate Continuing Value:** We estimated the continuing value using the key value driver formula with a perpetuity growth rate of 3% in the conjunction with a return on new incremental invested capital RONIC of 7%. We also computed continuing value using an alternative perpetuity growth rate of 2% and RONIC of 6% for sensitivity analysis. 
6. **Calculate Enterprise and Equity Value:** We discounted projected free cash flows and the continuing value at the weighted average cost of capital to estimate enterprise value. From this, we subtracted the value of nonoperating liabilities (debt and other non-equity claims) to get equity value.
7. **Compute Value per Share:**  We divided equity value by the number of shares outstanding.
8. **Scenario Analysis:**  We weighed the results from our base case, upside, and downside scenarios using probabilities derived from historical economic growth and recession probabilities provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Federal Reserve.
{: .note }

> **Note:** We made appropriate adjustments for differences between accounting and intrinsic views by adding back cumulative amortization of goodwill, adding back nonoperating expenses, and making other changes to reflect a normalized environment, as described in "Valuation."

The resulting intrinsic valuation is approximately **$120 billion**, which was in the neighborhood of PNC's market capitalization at the time of writing this response.  Given the uncertainty surrounding economic performance over the next few years, this valuation may well be too high, as it is based on a long-term trajectory which assumes that PNC will not only fully overcome its current difficulties in the short run but that it will also somehow sustain its current position in an industry that is becoming increasingly competitive.


**Detailed Valuation Example (Extract):**

The following is a simplified example of some of the DCF calculations and adjustments:

PNC's latest 2023 10-Q reports net income available to common share holders of $1,313 million in the first quarter.  As per our methodology to estimate cash flow we add $221 million in depreciation and subtract net cash investment from continuing operations of -$320 million to arrive at a free cash flow to firm of $1,214 million in the first quarter.

* **Capital Expenditures:** We obtained capital expenditures from PNC's statements of cash flows. (2022 Q3 filings)
* **Depreciation and Amortization:** These values come from PNC's statements of cash flow (2022 Q3 filings)

{: .highlight }

> **Highlight:**  Remember that for intrinsic valuation purposes, we add back cumulative amortization of goodwill. We will also adjust for the effects of acquisitions and divestitures on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).



**Additional Notes:**

* **COVID-19:** PNC's recent financial performance has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially within its Corporate & Institutional Banking segment.  Management has addressed these challenges in earnings calls and presentations, emphasizing their efforts to support their clients during this period (2020 Q1 earnings call) and adapt to changing market conditions.  They have recognized credit losses due to the pandemic and economic downturn, decreased loans outstanding in retail, and decreased capital expenditures from pre-pandemic levels (2022 Q1 earnings call). 
* **Interest Rate Hikes:** Management has expressed concern about the impact of rising interest rates on net interest income (2023 Q3 earnings call). 
* **Economic Conditions:**  The management anticipates continued economic volatility and uncertainty in the near future (2022 Q4 earnings call). They also cited the impact of an uncertain economic environment, competitive pricing pressures, rising energy prices and increased inflation on their revenues as well. 
* **Commercial Real Estate:** PNC has recognized credit losses due to the pandemic and economic downturn, decreased loans outstanding in retail, and decreased capital expenditures from pre-pandemic levels (2022 Q1 earnings call). Management acknowledged increasing loan losses for commercial and industrial as well as residential real estate loans driven by increasing risk arising from higher rates and unemployment expectations(2022 Q1 earnings call). 
* **Inflation**: Management mentioned how they expect rising inflation to benefit them through rising interest rate on variable products. However, they also acknowledged the negative impact of rising inflation on purchase prices for real estate (2022 Q2 earnings call). Rising inflation had led to a decrease in loan activity, but increase in interest income. 
* **Credit risk**: There is an increased risk of higher delinquencies and losses as customers are unable to service their debt at higher interest rates (2023 Q1 earnings call).


**Conclusion**

PNC is a well-established regional bank with some competitive advantages, but it operates in a fiercely competitive and highly regulated industry.  Management's capital allocation decisions, while focused on growth, raise concerns about their long-term commitment to value creation. Its current market price approximately reflects its intrinsic value as determined by our DCF, leaving little margin of safety.  An economic downturn and the increasing risks in commercial real estate add to existing concerns. As a value investor, and taking inspiration from Micheal Burry, a skeptical outlook is warranted, and a higher margin of safety is desirable. Given the challenges and low visibility, there is no obvious catalyst for a near term share price increase, hence, making the investment unattractive for the discerning investor.  The intelligent investor needs a good reason to buy a company's share not just because the company is not performing up to its potential.
