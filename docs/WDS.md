{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Woodside benefits from some cost advantages stemming from its established production infrastructure and access to reserves. However, these advantages are not significant enough to constitute a wide moat.  The industry is characterized by massive capital investments and the commodity nature of the product limits pricing power.  While Woodside's scale provides some advantage, the oil and gas industry is dominated by much larger players, limiting its overall competitive edge. As mentioned in "Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies," scale advantages matter most at the local level, and even at that level, Woodside faces stiff competition.  Further, the "Measuring Global Insights" report emphasizes the importance of sustainable value creation, derived from ROIC exceeding WACC, and Woodside's performance in this regard has been inconsistent.

**Management (3/5):**

Woodside's management team has a mixed track record.  While they have successfully managed operations and overseen large acquisitions (like BHP Petroleum), the company's returns have not consistently outperformed the market, which suggests a limited capacity to translate strategic positioning into enduring value creation (as discussed in "The Little Book of Valuation").

* **History & Experience:**  The CEO and CFO have relevant industry experience, which is positive.  However, the board's expertise seems more concentrated in traditional energy rather than newer, greener energy, potentially limiting strategic vision in a changing landscape. (Woodside Annual Report 2022, Board of Directors section)
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance and shareholder returns, which is generally a good sign. However, the specific targets and metrics used for performance evaluation are not clearly defined in the annual report, making it difficult to independently assess their effectiveness (Woodside 2022 Annual Report - Remuneration Report). Furthermore, executive compensation is heavily weighted towards short-term incentives.
* **Capital Allocation:** The BHP acquisition has increased scale and diversified the company's portfolio. However, the large debt load taken on to finance this acquisition is a concern, particularly given the cyclical nature of the business.  The company's commitment to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks can be positive, but its sustainability during down cycles remains to be seen. The management has stated the intent of using the increased cash flow to deleverage the company. (Woodside 2022 Annual Report)
* **Communication:**  The company's investor relations could be improved. While the annual report provides some details on strategy and operations, there could be greater transparency regarding long-term plans, key performance indicators, and capital allocation priorities. As discussed in "The Little Book of Valuation," clear communication with intrinsic investors is crucial. The Woodside reports also heavily use non-IFRS measures to describe financial performance without highlighting their differences with IFRS measures.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership levels seem modest.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts include:

* **Successful integration of BHP assets and realization of synergies:**  This acquisition dramatically increased the company's scale, but the success of integration and full realization of projected cost savings and revenue enhancements are crucial. (Woodside 2022 Annual Report)
* **Growth in LNG demand:**  Continued global growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) could benefit Woodside given its substantial LNG portfolio.  However, this catalyst is subject to macroeconomic factors and competition. (Woodside 2022 Annual Report)
* **New energy projects:** Investments in new energy sources, including hydrogen and carbon capture, have the potential to generate long-term value. (Woodside 2022 Annual Report). However, these projects are in early stages and their success is uncertain.

{: .warning }

Overall, the catalyst outlook is moderate, depending heavily on external factors and successful execution of existing projects.


**Business:**

Woodside operates across the LNG, pipeline gas, conventional oil, and new energy business segments.

* **LNG:** The company's largest business segment. Woodside's operations are concentrated in Australia but the company also has a footprint in other regions, such as Senegal.
* **Pipeline Gas:**  Supplies gas to Australian domestic and Western Australian markets.
* **Conventional Oil:**  Smaller and declining segment with oil production primarily focused in Australia and some minor stakes in other international projects.
* **New Energy:**  Relatively new segment focused on hydrogen and other carbon-neutral energy solutions. This segment is currently small and loss-making but has substantial growth potential. (Woodside 2022 Annual Report).

The LNG industry is becoming increasingly competitive with new capacity coming online and geopolitical forces creating uncertainty.

{: .note }

The current downturn in oil prices has created stress for the company and its shareholders, and the recovery in the company’s share price has been partially driven by increases in liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices. (Woodside 2023 Half Year Results, CEO Overview section)



**Financials:**

* **Revenue:** Woodside’s revenue has grown significantly in recent years primarily due to the BHP acquisition.  (Woodside 2022 Annual Report)
* **Margins:**  Operating margins are healthy but vary considerably from year to year, reflecting the cyclicality of commodity prices. (Woodside 2022 Annual Report)
* **Return on Capital:**  Historically, Woodside has generated adequate returns on invested capital.  However, its returns are lower than some of its larger, more integrated competitors. (Woodside 2022 Annual Report)
* **Debt:**  The BHP acquisition substantially increased Woodside's debt burden.  While the company has initiated a deleveraging strategy, the high debt level remains a concern in a cyclical business. (Woodside 2023 Half Year Results)

**Valuation ($45 Billion):**

Given the cyclical nature of the business and the uncertainty surrounding future commodity prices, a conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to estimate Woodside's value.

* **Base Case:**  Assumes a modest long-term growth rate of 2 percent in revenues, operating margins of 10%, and a cost of capital of 9 percent (after accounting for country risk).
* **Downside Case:**  Assumes a 1% annual decline in revenues and operating margins of 5%, reflecting a prolonged downturn in commodity prices.
* **Probability Weighting:**  Assigns a 60 percent probability to the base case and a 40 percent probability to the downside case.

{: .important }

This probability weighting is subjective and can be adjusted based on individual risk tolerance and outlook for commodity markets.


**Detailed Calculations:**

Given the cyclical nature of the business and its long term trajectory, we use a two-stage DCF model, similar to the way we did in the Amazon.com example. The steps involved are:
 
**Step 1: Forecast revenue:** We forecasted revenues for the next five years based on industry growth of 1% and a conservative long-term revenue growth rate of 2%. Given that WDS is pursuing cost leadership, the company is unlikely to increase market share. Therefore, company revenue growth will track the industry growth.


**Step 2: Forecast operating margin, reinvestment rate, and ROIC:** We use the historical 10-year average operating margin of 10% for years 1-5, growing steadily to 25% for the 15-year forecast period. At the same time, WDS expects to reduce its reinvestment rate as the company matures. Using the formula, ROIC = Growth / Reinvestment Rate, for the historical 10-year average ROIC of 10% and a growth of 2%, we can back out the reinvestment rate, which is 20%. The ROIC in the continuing value period is set at 10%.

**Step 3: Forecast depreciation:** We use the historical 10-year average depreciation rate of 5% of prior-year PP&E.

**Step 4: Forecast NOPLAT, free cash flow (FCF), invested capital, and continuing value:** Using revenue forecasts and performance forecasts, we calculate NOPLAT, FCF, invested capital, and continuing value using the methodology described in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies."

**Step 5: Estimate cost of capital:** We use a cost of capital of 9%, accounting for the business-as-usual country risk of Australia, which we consider to be a relatively stable emerging economy.  We justify this by using a blended cost of capital based on publicly available debt and equity market data.

**Step 6: Discount the cash flows:** Discount the projected FCF and continuing value back to today at the weighted average cost of capital to arrive at the value of the company’s operations.


**Step 7: Value non-operating assets:** We did not identify any material non-operating assets, such as minority interest, deferred taxes, restructuring reserves, and tax loss carry-forwards.

**Step 8: Value of the firm:** We derive firm value as the value of the operating assets and nonoperating assets.

**Step 9: Convert the value of the firm to equity value:** We derive equity value by subtracting net debt and nonequity financial claims from the firm value. The company’s equity is valued at $55 billion.

**Step 10: Convert equity value to value per share:** At the time of writing this report, the company's shares outstanding were about 2 billion, implying a per share value of approximately $27.5.
{: .highlight }

It is crucial to re-emphasize that these calculations are based on conservative estimates and assumptions.  A different set of assumptions would yield a different valuation. 

**Concerns and Controversies:**

Recent concerns and controversies include scrutiny of the company's environmental impact and its role in climate change.  These issues could potentially impact the company's value in the future if they lead to increased regulations, litigation, or consumer backlash.

{: .new }

Woodside also faced challenges integrating the BHP Petroleum assets and recently announced impairments on some acquired assets.  This raises questions about the company's due diligence process and its ability to execute large acquisitions successfully. (Woodside Annual Report 2023)


{: .important }

Investors should pay close attention to how the company addresses these issues, as they could materially impact its future cash flows and, consequently, its value. This is why the conservative approach to valuation is vital in this case.
