>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

NetEase's moat stems primarily from its **strong brand** in the Chinese gaming market and the **high switching costs** associated with its online games.  Network effects could also be a source of NetEase’s moat, but they are not the primary driver of value creation.

* **Brand:** NetEase enjoys a leading position in the Chinese gaming market. Brand loyalty is high in this market. A recognized brand name provides an intangible quality-competitive advantage.
* **Switching Costs:**  Players have invested significant time and money building their in-game characters, social networks, and virtual possessions. Shifting to another gaming platform comes with the risk of losing these investments, which makes gamers reluctant to leave existing games. These are high customer switching costs.
* **Network Effects:** Although not as powerful as brand and switching costs, there are some network effects at play. The larger the network of players, the more attractive NetEase’s platform becomes for gamers, which can, in turn, attract additional users and developers.  This is not as much of a winner-take-all market as some internet businesses, however. 
* **Rating Justification:** NetEase operates in a fast-growing and profitable industry where there are some network effects, the brand is valuable, and there are significant switching costs. This would warrant a 3/5 rating. 

{: .warning }

NetEase is subject to the whims of the Chinese government, and regulatory crackdowns or restrictions could negatively impact its business and weaken its moat. The company has been able to withstand these pressures historically, but I remain cautiously pessimistic because political risk is very real.
{: .important }

The company's dependence on a single market (China) also adds an element of risk and makes me more skeptical, and I have lowered the rating by one because of this.


**Management:**

* **History/Experience:** The founder, William Ding, has led the company for over 20 years. He has a proven track record in the industry, which provides a certain level of confidence, although this is somewhat muted by the recent history of many Chinese firms, even those that have been listed on the NYSE for 10 years or more. 
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  NetEase has historically made wise investments in growth opportunities, like its expansion in mobile gaming and its music streaming service.  The company has experienced some notable failures as well, and it has made some investments that did not earn attractive returns and destroyed value, although such failures can serve as opportunities for reflection and learning.
* **Communication:**  NetEase's communications with investors and analysts are satisfactory, although not outstanding. 
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is linked to long-term shareholder value.
* **Insider Ownership:** William Ding owns a significant portion of the company's shares. Insider ownership, although decreasing, is still above 35 percent. It is unclear what would happen should Mr. Ding’s stake ever fall substantially below this level.
* **Rating Justification:** Although I am willing to acknowledge the company’s successful track record and overall transparency, there is some uncertainty surrounding how the company might be affected by the long-term, ongoing Chinese slowdown or other geopolitical challenges, like the risk of nationalization or expropriation. This concern, plus NetEase’s increasing dependence on game franchising from other parties, makes me assign it a 3/5 rating.

{: .important }

I believe there is still room for improvement in communicating with Western investors, especially on the company’s approach to tackling valuation and its perspective on industry dynamics. I have lowered the rating by one because of this.


**Catalyst:**

* **Gaming Market Growth:** NetEase should continue to benefit from growth in the gaming market, both domestically and internationally. A resumption of double-digit revenue growth would certainly provide upside.
* **Expansion in Mobile Gaming:**  NetEase's expansion into mobile gaming is a key catalyst for growth.  Growth in mobile gaming is outpacing growth in PC gaming.
* **Catalyst Rating:** Based on these factors, I have assigned NetEase a catalyst rating of 2/5.


**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** NetEase's revenues come primarily from online games, followed by online music, online advertising, and its innovative businesses segment. Mobile games account for over 75 percent of online game services revenue.
* **Industry Trends:** The gaming industry is growing rapidly, and this industry is consolidating, with the emergence of mobile gaming, cloud gaming, the metaverse, and artificial intelligence. The biggest challenge facing online and mobile game companies is the increasing cost of product development, user acquisition, and maintenance.
* **Margins:**  NetEase's operating margins have declined substantially during the past three years, as a result of the decrease in the sales of existing games in addition to an increase in the amount spent on marketing, cloud infrastructure, research and development, headcount additions, and employee compensation costs.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The biggest players in China’s video gaming industry are Tencent and NetEase, but these two giants remain susceptible to disruption and intense competition, especially from smaller, more nimble entrants. Also, there are potential political risks associated with the Chinese market. This would lead me to assign it only a 3/5 moat.
* **Differentiators:**  NetEase is distinguished from other gaming companies in several ways, but not in a way that creates significant additional value. It excels at developing high-quality games, it's known for its artistic sensibilities and innovative game designs, and it has a proven track record of building and leveraging gaming intellectual property. These advantages may become diluted in the coming years, however, because of the competitive dynamics of this high-growth industry with easy entry and exit of rivals.
{: .note }

Note: NetEase’s dependence on a single market makes it susceptible to additional risk that a company that operated on a broader geographic basis would not be subject to.
{: .important }

NetEase relies heavily on game franchising, and there is a risk that game makers could pull their games.


**Financials:**

* **Revenue and EBIT:**  NetEase's revenues and earnings have been growing rapidly, although growth has slowed in recent years.  The company reports annual revenues and earnings in RMB, adjusted to U.S. dollars and adjusted again for inflation using the U.S. consumer price index. The company’s consolidated revenue increased to RMB 90.1 billion in 2022 from RMB 81.8 billion in 2021. NetEase’s revenues increased substantially for the years 2019 through 2021 as its market share increased from 19.8 percent to 23.1 percent. But, since 2020, the company has been reporting negative EBITDA with earnings falling considerably as competitive pressures have increased.
* **Balance Sheet:** NetEase’s balance sheet is very clean, with a cash-to-equity ratio of 36.2 percent, which makes it look much healthier than its peers. This position allows the company to invest opportunistically and return cash to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.
* **Cash Flows:** NetEase’s cash flows should be derived from its EBIT adjusted for taxes plus operating depreciation less operating capital expenditures and changes in noncash working capital. Although they are difficult to estimate, they can reveal the amount the company is reinvesting each year, and how efficiently it is doing so. The company’s reinvestment ratio has increased substantially from 15 percent to 60 percent due to an aggressive acquisition and product development strategy for expanding its existing portfolio as well as accelerating its presence in new geographic markets. These heavy investments may jeopardize the firm’s profitability in the coming years.
* **ROIC:** As a proxy for ROIC in a high-growth, highly levered company, it's appropriate to look at the company’s cash-flow return on investment (CFROI). It’s a better measure since ROA and ROE can be distorted by high operating leverage. It gives its shareholders a better measure of the profits earned on the money invested in the business. Although CFROI decreased significantly from 2017 through 2019, the indicator gradually recovered after the company introduced new business lines, such as NetEase Cloud Music (NTCM) in the fourth quarter of 2019 and Youdao (DAO) in the second quarter of 2019.
* **Valuation Insights:** In a mature market where there is fierce competition and lower profit margins, it’s harder for a company to earn higher returns on invested capital. Despite that, NetEase is succeeding in maintaining excess returns. 


**Valuation:**

I used a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model to arrive at a valuation for NetEase. A DCF model is based upon the idea that the value of a company is the present value of its future cash flows. Given the riskiness of the cash flows, however, we cannot simply use a risk-free rate to discount those cash flows back to today. We need to use the company's cost of capital and apply probability weights to account for failure and uncertainty.

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on NetEase’s recent performance as well as the experience of industry peers, we expect its revenue to grow at a moderate pace, growing at 8 percent per year for the next five years and converging gradually to 3 percent.
* **Margins:**  We assume that NetEase's operating margin will also converge over the next five years, recovering from negative margins to a terminal operating margin of 12 percent. This is a normalized level of margins based on the company’s long-term history of profitability.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We assume a reinvestment rate of 40 percent.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a risk-free rate of 4 percent (assuming a U.S. dollar-denominated discount rate), a risk premium of 5 percent, and an estimated cost of equity of 8 percent.
* **Failure Rate:** To estimate the likelihood of failure, we use the average failure rates for U.S.-based companies:  about 10 percent.
* **Terminal Value:** We calculate the terminal value using a discount rate of 9 percent in combination with a 3 percent terminal growth rate.
{: .important }
* **Valuation:** Discounting the cash flows over the next ten years back to the present, we get a present value of $78 billion for NetEase’s operations. Adding cash and other non-operating assets and subtracting the market value of the company’s debt, we arrive at an equity value of $83 billion.  Subtracting an appropriate illiquidity discount of 10 percent (since we are applying an investor's perspective), assuming a U.S.-dollar-denominated return and an annual turnover of the company’s shares of about 5 percent, produces a value of approximately $90 billion for the company.

{: .important }

This valuation is sensitive to changes in several assumptions. In particular, a lower growth rate and lower operating margin would substantially reduce the company’s value, and any changes in regulation that negatively affect gaming companies would certainly have an impact, too.
