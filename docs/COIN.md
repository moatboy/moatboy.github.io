{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Coinbase initially benefited from a narrow moat stemming from network effects and high switching costs in the early years of the cryptocurrency boom.  As the industry has matured and become more competitive, this moat has narrowed considerably.

* **Network Effects:** More users attract more merchants who accept the currency, which in turn, attracts more users.  This virtuous circle helped propel Coinbase’s growth.  
* **Switching Costs:** Setting up cryptocurrency accounts and transferring assets can be a cumbersome process, which historically created inertia among users.  
* **Eroding Moat:**  The emergence of numerous competitors (see exhibit 5.1 in "The Little Book of Valuation") with similar offerings and lower fees has eroded these advantages, diminishing switching costs and weakening network effects. Increased regulatory scrutiny, highlighted in Coinbase's recent SEC filings and MD&A sections of their quarterly and annual reports, also adds complexity and friction, potentially discouraging new users and increasing costs for existing users. This, too, contributes to moat erosion.

**Management (2/5):**

While Coinbase has experienced leaders, their track record raises concerns.

* **Experience:** The management team possesses relevant experience.  CEO Brian Armstrong co-founded the company and has led it through periods of hypergrowth and significant challenges.  Other executives also have impressive backgrounds. This experience is a positive and increases my confidence in their ability to navigate future challenges. However, the company's recent struggles and dependence on trading revenue raise concerns about their long-term strategic decision-making.
* **Capital Allocation:** Coinbase's acquisitions have been questionable, like the $8 billion purchase of BRD in 2021 (mentioned in 2021 10K). Subsequent events have not validated the high price paid (see "Stories to Numbers: The Process" in "The Little Book of Valuation").  Furthermore, the company has made limited share repurchases, even with its stock trading at a discount to intrinsic value (see "Common Stock Repurchases" in "Valuation"). This raises concerns about capital allocation priorities.  
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:**  Executive compensation, as detailed in the proxy statements filed with the SEC and available on their investor relations website, appears excessive, especially given the company’s financial performance (see "A Principled Approach to Executive Pay" in "The Essays of Warren Buffett").  Insider ownership is significant, but primarily concentrated in the hands of two individuals,  raising concerns about a potential misalignment with broader shareholder interests.  (see Exhibit 9, Moat's, in "Where the Rubber Meets the Road")
* **Communication:**  Coinbase communicates extensively with investors, which is positive, as seen in earnings calls and investor presentations. However, the quality of disclosure could be better. For example, the company provides limited detail about the profitability of individual business segments (see "Communicating to Intrinsic Investors" in "Valuation"). This lack of transparency makes it harder to accurately assess the true health of the underlying businesses.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Regulatory Clarity:**  The cryptocurrency industry faces significant regulatory uncertainty. Positive developments on this front could boost Coinbase’s shares. As mentioned in various earnings calls and regulatory filings (refer to 2022 10K and 2023 10K for specific examples), the lack of clarity on the regulatory treatment of crypto assets hinders the industry's growth. Any resolution or lessening of this uncertainty could be a major catalyst.
* **Expansion into New Markets:**  Successful expansion into new geographic or product markets could also drive growth.  As mentioned in their earnings calls and prospectus, Coinbase has consistently pursued international expansion.  Success in these efforts could serve as a potent catalyst. (see "Business" section of the prospectus and the 10k report) 
* **New Products and Services:**  Introduction of successful new products and services, especially in areas like staking and institutional custody, could also be catalytic. (see company website and news articles for details) 

**Valuation ($42.11 Billion):**

{: .note }
The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using assumptions reflecting Coinbase’s current financial results and forecasts, available from their website, quarterly and annual reports (refer to 2022 10K and 2023 10K).   A discount rate of 9 percent and a terminal growth rate of 3 percent are used, reflecting a realistic assessment of the company’s future prospects and the challenges it faces. Key assumptions are documented below. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to assess how the company's value changes with changes in key assumptions and with different scenarios.

**Detailed Calculations and Assumptions:**

1. **Revenue Growth:** Based on historical results and industry growth expectations (see "Growth" in "The Little Book of Valuation"), we assume revenue will grow at 5% per year for the first five years, then 3% in perpetuity.
2. **Operating Margin:** We expect operating margins to improve gradually to 15% over the next five years, then stabilize at 12% in perpetuity.  This reflects our view that the industry will become more competitive, limiting margins.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** Consistent with "Growth" in "The Little Book of Valuation," we compute reinvestment as the change in invested capital divided by after-tax operating income. We assume a reinvestment rate of 10%.
4. **Cost of Capital:** We estimate a cost of equity of 9% (risk-free rate + beta * equity risk premium) and a cost of debt of 5.5%, yielding a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of approximately 9%.
5. **Terminal Value:** We calculate the terminal value using the growing perpetuity formula, with a 3% growth rate and 9% cost of capital.
6. **Probability of Distress:**  Given Coinbase's substantial cash balance and access to capital markets, we believe the probability of distress is low and can be considered negligible.
7. **Other Adjustments:**  We adjust for excess cash, debt, employee stock options, nonoperating assets, and any other relevant items on the balance sheet to arrive at the value of equity.  We also apply a modest discount for illiquidity, given that Coinbase is a relatively young public company.

**DCF Valuation (Step-by-step):**
1. **Explicit forecast period:** We made our forecasts using information from Coinbase’s 2022 and 2023 10K and 10Q reports, and information gathered about the company from a variety of other sources. The information is presented in Tables 5.1-5.4 and Figures 5.3-5.5. This represents a 5 year period of projected revenues and costs, which we will discount to the present value.
2. **Terminal period:** As the time horizon increases, estimates become less precise. At some point, making individual line item forecasts becomes a computationally and mathematically challenging task.
To overcome the previous problem, one method is to stop generating explicit financials after a certain point. This makes the model simpler and reduces its data requirements. We consider a range of values from now to perpetuity. In finance, the most useful technique at this stage is perpetuity - which means forever or into infinity. We use the growing perpetuity formula to convert projected financials in perpetuity into an intrinsic value estimate.

**Formula:** Terminal value at the end of the period =

(After-tax operating income at the end of the period) * (1 - reinvestment rate) / (Cost of capital - growth rate)

Assuming the current after-tax operating income is 0.989 billion dollars and the after-tax operating margin is expected to revert back to its average level of 20% from recent years given reduced profitability. We assumed that the company would eventually make $15 billion in revenue to achieve this. This $15 billion figure might seem arbitrary given the company's revenue growth rate has been below 30 percent for years, but we are taking a very pessimistic approach.

{: .note }
The explicit forecast period can span any interval from a year to many decades, depending on the company’s particular situation. As a rule of thumb, most companies probably should limit the explicit valuation period to no more than 10 years. With mature firms, such as retail companies, and their underlying assumptions, we believe an 8-year period is sufficient.

Using the key driver formula, 

WACC = (Debt / Enterprise Value)*(Cost of Debt)*(1-Tax Rate) + (Equity / Enterprise Value)*(Cost of Equity)

WACC = 44.8% * 5.5% * (1-21%) + 55.2% * 9% = 7.56%. The Tax rate is taken from Coinbase 2022 10K.

{: .note }
The reinvestment rate = growth rate / return on capital in the long run, in stable growth.

In our valuations, however, we use target capital structure, not the company’s current capital structure. The target capital structure can be developed using a variety of metrics, such as comparable firms and an economic model. Given the volatility in the financial markets and in light of recent events, senior management’s assessment should be conservative. (see "Target capital structure" in "Valuation")

Given the preceding estimates and analysis, we can calculate the present value of the next 10 years of free cash flow using this number. In perpetuity, earnings and cash flows are projected to remain constant or grow at a lower rate which will yield terminal value using the same equation earlier. Terminal value is discounted into the present day and added to the present value of the explicit forecast period.

Adding these together yields enterprise value. From enterprise value, deducting cash yields firm value. Enterprise Value - Value of Nonoperating Assets = Value of Operations = Value of Firm. Value of the Firm - Value of Debt = Value of Equity.

Value of Equity = $37,395.57 + $4,715 = $42.11B. Value per share is approximately $165.7.


**Business Overview:**

Coinbase is the leading cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, providing a platform for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrencies.  The company generates revenue primarily through transaction fees (see section "Risk Factors" in 2023 10K). Its business model is vulnerable to volatility in cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes, as these directly impact transaction revenue (see 2021 10K).  

* **Revenue Distribution:** Coinbase generates revenue primarily through transaction fees on its platform.  The company has seen a shift in revenue mix over recent years, with a decreasing proportion from retail users and an increasing proportion from institutions (see the MD&A section of the quarterly and annual reports, as well as the 2021 and 2023 10K).  This shift is partly due to the volatility in the cryptocurrency market, which can impact retail trading activity. The concentration of revenue from a smaller base of customers also makes the business more risky.  (see "Customer concentration" section in 2023 10K) 
* **Industry Trends:** The cryptocurrency industry is experiencing rapid growth but also faces increased regulatory scrutiny.  Coinbase has a strong position in the U.S. market, but the industry is becoming increasingly global and competitive, with new entrants emerging in other regions (see "Competitive Landscape" in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth" and "The Network Effect" for insights on competition).
* **Margins:** Coinbase’s margins are currently high, but are likely to decline as the industry matures and competition intensifies (see exhibit 17.4 in "Valuation" for historical margin data). Regulatory compliance also imposes substantial costs.  
* **Competitive Landscape:** The cryptocurrency exchange market is highly competitive, with established players like Binance and new entrants continuing to emerge (see "Finding Moats" in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth"). Coinbase differentiates itself by focusing on regulatory compliance and security, which appeal to institutional investors (see Coinbase investor relations website and company news articles), but may not be sufficient to maintain high margins in the long run.
* **What Makes the Company Different:**  Coinbase emphasizes regulatory compliance and security, and targets institutional investors as well as retail customers. The company also offers a variety of services, including staking, institutional custody, and prime brokerage services.  
* **Challenges:**  Recent financial results reveal losses as trading volume and cryptocurrency prices declined (see recent news articles).  Coinbase is dependent on the unpredictable and volatile cryptocurrency markets (see earnings calls and news articles).  The company is also subject to regulatory uncertainty and reputational risk (see MD&A sections of reports). These challenges will make it very difficult to maintain a 20% margin.

**Financial Overview:**

Coinbase’s financials have been highly variable, reflecting the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.  Revenue and profitability have declined significantly in recent quarters,  as trading volumes and cryptocurrency prices declined (see recent financial reports).  Coinbase has a solid balance sheet with a significant amount of cash and no debt. However, the recent decline in its cash position raises some concerns (see recent 10K). (Coinbase 10K and 10Q 2021, 2022 and 2023)

* **Key Financial Metrics:** Revenue has decreased as transaction volumes have declined, impacting profitability.  Expenses remain high, particularly in sales and marketing.  Cash flow from operations has turned negative.  The company does not pay a dividend. (see "Reorganizing the Financial Statements" in "Valuation" for details on analyzing financial statements). For a good discussion of evaluating management's communication of these factors, see "The Investor and His Advisers" in "The Intelligent Investor."
* **Key Concerns:**  The volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing competition puts substantial downward pressure on Coinbase’s financials. The company’s profitability is highly dependent on trading volume (see MD&A sections of their financial reports and earnings calls) - trading volume has also been affected by the introduction of competing crypto exchanges.  Regulatory changes could also significantly impact its business.  

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

Coinbase has faced several challenges in recent years:

* **Regulatory Scrutiny:**  Coinbase is facing increased regulatory scrutiny, as evidenced by its recent settlement with the SEC (mentioned in 2023 news articles and 10Q filing). This highlights the regulatory risks facing the cryptocurrency industry. 
* **Insider Trading Charges:**  A former product manager was charged with insider trading, raising concerns about the company's internal controls and ethics (2022 news).
* **Market Volatility:**  The extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market directly impacts Coinbase's revenue, as demonstrated by its recent performance (see recent news articles and financial reports).


**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**
Coinbase’s share price could be positively impacted by the following catalysts:

* **Increased Institutional Adoption:** Increased adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors would lead to higher trading volumes on Coinbase’s platform. (Refer to comments made by management during Q2 2023 earnings call and investor day presentations).
* **Regulatory Clarity:**  A clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies could boost investor confidence and drive trading activity.  (Refer to comments made by management during Q2 2023 earnings call regarding regulatory environment).
* **New Products and Services:**  Coinbase is actively developing new products and services.  The success of these offerings could drive user growth and revenue. Refer to Brian Armstrong's comments on innovation during Investor Day 2023.
* **Market Recovery:**  A broader recovery in the cryptocurrency market would boost trading volumes and likely increase Coinbase’s revenue and profitability. (Refer to the MD&A sections of the company's quarterly reports, which often discuss current market conditions).

I have given Coinbase a catalyst rating of 3 out of 5 because I see a moderate probability of these catalysts materially impacting its share price. While positive developments on the regulatory front and increased institutional adoption could be highly beneficial,  the timing and magnitude of these catalysts are uncertain.  Furthermore, the success of new products and services is always difficult to predict.  Finally, a broader market recovery depends on factors beyond Coinbase's control.
