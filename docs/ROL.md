{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Rollins benefits from some elements of a narrow moat, stemming primarily from brand recognition (Orkin being its most recognized brand) and high customer switching costs. Once a homeowner or business establishes a pest control plan, the inconvenience and potential disruption of switching providers often outweigh the cost savings. However, this moat is not insurmountable.  Competition exists from numerous local and regional players, putting downward pressure on pricing power and margins. The high degree of fragmentation in the industry also makes it challenging for any one company to establish a truly dominant position. This lack of pricing power is reflected in Rollins' low EBITDA margins of around 22 percent.

**Management (3/5):**

> Management's quality is a critical factor in assessing any business, but particularly so in fragmented and commoditized industries where leadership is paramount to sustained excess returns. 

Rollins’ management team has a mixed track record. On the positive side, they have delivered consistent revenue and earnings growth over several decades. They have also wisely focused on reinvesting in the core pest control business and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. These actions suggest a long-term orientation.

However, the high executive compensation and use of adjusted earnings metrics raise concerns. In the Q4 2020 earnings call, the CEO noted that Rollins added back share-based compensation, which is concerning given its use for employee and management compensation, as share dilution increases, this can potentially diminish shareholders' returns and therefore give a misleading picture of value generation for the company. This suggests a possible prioritizing of short-term optics over long-term shareholder value creation.  Additionally, the management's insider ownership, while not insignificant, is not high enough to fully align their incentives with outside shareholders.  Rollins has recently expanded through multiple acquisitions - a large number of acquisitions suggests that some may not add value for outside shareholders.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:**  Rollins generates its revenues primarily from recurring service contracts for pest and termite control. Residential pest control accounts for the majority of revenues, with commercial pest control and termite control making up the rest.  Rollins' most recognizable brand is Orkin, but it also operates under other brand names.
* **Industry Trends:** The pest control industry is highly fragmented and characterized by low switching costs for customers. This highly competitive landscape leads to pressure on prices and margins. However, the industry also benefits from steady demand, driven by the essential nature of pest control services and a growing awareness of pest-related health risks.
* **Margins:** Rollins has relatively low operating margins compared to other consumer service businesses, reflecting the industry's competitive nature. These margins have been negatively impacted in recent quarters due to rising costs for fuel, labor, materials, and vehicles. In the Q1 2023 earnings call, CEO Jerry Gahlhoff noted inflationary impacts from fuel, labor, and vehicle costs.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Rollins faces competition from a wide range of national, regional, and local players.  The largest national competitor is Terminix, but there are hundreds of smaller companies.  
* **Differentiation:** Rollins attempts to differentiate itself through its well-known brands, particularly Orkin, and by focusing on customer service. It offers bundled services and guarantees and has expanded in the past decade through the acquisition of other pest control companies.

**Financials:**

Rollins has a history of consistent revenue and earnings growth, fueled by both organic growth and acquisitions. From 2009 to 2023, the pest control industry has generated solid returns on invested capital, with Rollins' exceeding the industry median. However, growth has slowed in recent years, and margins have declined due to cost pressures.  The company has a solid balance sheet with low debt levels.

{: .warning }

A potential concern is the company's increasing reliance on acquisitions for growth.  While acquisitions can be a viable path to expansion, they can also be destructive if poorly executed or overvalued.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Pricing Power:**  If Rollins can successfully raise prices to offset cost pressures, this could be a positive catalyst for the stock.  However, given the fragmented and competitive nature of the industry, the ability to raise prices substantially is limited.
* **Industry Consolidation:** If Rollins can acquire and successfully integrate smaller players, this could lead to increased market share and economies of scale, potentially boosting margins and earnings.
* **Expansion into New Markets:** Rollins continues to expand into new geographic markets, which could provide a long-term growth opportunity.
* **New Products and Services:** The development of new, innovative pest control products and services could also drive growth. The company is growing its presence in the emerging pest-control market in Asia, however this comes at a cost, the company faces the increased risks of operating within a different country.
* **Cost Cutting:**  Rollins continues to implement a cost-cutting program focused on increasing operational efficiencies, which could further boost margins. In Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO noted the company achieved solid cost improvements through reducing general & administrative and depreciation expense on an incremental basis.

**Valuation ($40.72 billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was performed using the following assumptions:

* **Forecast Period:** 5 years 
* **Revenue Growth:**  3% (decreasing linearly from 5% in the following year to 3% in the stable growth period) - pessimistic view given recent slowing growth and competitive pressures.
* **Operating Margin:** 22% (staying constant) - this is in line with recent margins and reflects the industry's competitive nature. In the Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO noted the operating margin increased.
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (staying constant) - this is in line with recent tax rates.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40% (decreasing linearly from 70% in year one to 40% during the stable growth period)
* **Cost of Equity:** 9.00% (Risk-free rate: 3.80%, Equity Risk Premium: 4.0%, Beta: 1.20) - this reflects a slightly higher risk premium than the market due to the aforementioned risks and a beta of 1.20 from company's 10K.
* **Cost of Debt:** 4.80% - this is based on Rollins' current cost of debt.
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 3.00%  - assumes long-term growth in line with inflation.

**DCF Valuation Calculations:**

{: .note }

The precise details of these calculations can be found in tables and charts throughout the valuation section.


* **Free cash flow (FCF):** Calculated using historical financials and forecasts.
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the terminal growth rate and WACC.
* **Present Value of FCF:** Discounted using the WACC.
* **Present Value of Terminal Value:** Discounted using the WACC.
* **Enterprise Value:** Sum of present value of FCF and present value of terminal value.
* **Equity Value:** Enterprise Value + Cash - Debt + Minority interest - Noncontrolling interests.
* **Value per share:** Equity Value divided by number of shares outstanding.

{: .highlight }

Based on these assumptions, the **fair value** for Rollins is estimated to be **$40.72 billion**, or approximately **$36.85 per share**.  This is lower than the current market price, suggesting that the stock is slightly overvalued. 
<br>
Rollins' reliance on acquisitions is worrying. Further, its revenue growth rate has declined in the past decade. Rollins is growing in the online hospitality space, however, competition exists in this space as well, from large internet companies like Microsoft and Google.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

The recent concerns noted in news articles and earnings call pertain to margin compression caused by rising input costs, including fuel, labor, and vehicle costs. The ongoing threat of inflation has prompted a series of price increases, and the management has expressed optimism that these price increases will offset the higher costs, but this remains to be seen. Rollins is growing overseas, for instance in Australia, this would make its operations less transparent.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful Integration of Recent Acquisitions:** Rollins has made several acquisitions in recent years. The successful integration of these acquisitions, leading to cost synergies and revenue growth, could be a significant catalyst. Rollins acquired Fox Pest Control in 2019, however, Rollins still has a long way to go to earn back their investment on this.
* **Continued Growth in Emerging Markets:** Rollins is expanding its presence in emerging markets, which could provide a long-term growth opportunity. Rollins acquired its Canadian franchise in 2012.

**Key Risks:**

* **Competition:** The pest control industry is highly competitive, which could limit Rollins' pricing power and growth potential.
* **Economic Slowdown:** A general economic slowdown could negatively impact demand for pest control services.
* **Commodity Price Volatility:** Rollins' input costs, particularly fuel costs, are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices.
* **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in government regulations related to pest control could impact Rollins' business.
