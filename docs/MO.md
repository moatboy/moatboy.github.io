Altria's moat rests primarily on its well-known brands in the smokeable products segment, primarily *Marlboro* cigarettes. However, this moat is eroding due to declining cigarette volumes and increasing regulatory restrictions. Its other businesses, including oral tobacco products (*Copenhagen*, *Skoal*) and wine, are profitable but relatively small.  A key factor that makes intrinsic valuations challenging is its dual business model.

{: .warning }

The company's foray into reduced-risk products has been a mixed bag. Its investment in *JUUL* has resulted in significant losses, and its *on! nicotine pouch* products have shown modest success. While these products have the *potential* to diversify Altria away from combustible products, their long-term success is uncertain, and they are unlikely to fully offset the decline in cigarette sales any time soon.  Therefore, the company looks like a melting ice cube.
 

**Detailed Business Explanation**

* **Smokeable Products:** This segment, dominated by *Marlboro*, remains Altria's core business.  While *Marlboro* retains significant brand equity and pricing power (as evidenced by consistent price increases exceeding inflation), volumes continue their inexorable decline. This secular trend poses a significant challenge to Altria's future revenue growth.

During the second quarter 2023 earnings call, management stated, "Our leading premium brand, Marlboro...grew adjusted revenue and share with its adjusted revenue per unit continuing to outpace its reported share performance, exceeding its industry peers in retail channel volumes by 2 percentage points and its peers in retail channel revenues by 1.4 percentage points." This shows that Marlboro is outperforming some metrics. Yet the company's financial results clearly demonstrate that the smoking rate in the U.S. continues to decline. Altria's near-term growth in this segment will come from pricing power, squeezing existing customers, and cutting costs, not by increasing volume.

* **Oral Tobacco Products:**  This segment, including *Copenhagen* and *Skoal*, enjoys steady growth and generates solid cash flows. However, it is much smaller than the smokeable products business and faces competition from newer nicotine products.

During the second quarter 2023 earnings call, management stated, "Adjusted revenue per unit...grew both sequentially and year-over-year by 3.5% and 2.1% respectively...driven by higher pricing and favorable category mix." However, given FDA action to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars in 2024 (originally announced in April 2022), there's uncertainty around consumer purchasing behavior for smokeable products.

* **Wine:**  Altria owns *Ste. Michelle Wine Estates*, a profitable wine business. However, its contribution to Altria's overall financials is minimal.
* **Altria's Investments:** Altria has a number of nonoperating assets, including equity investments and excess cash.  The challenge for Altria is allocating this cash to create shareholder value effectively. Historically, the company has been prone to value-destroying acquisitions (e.g., *JUUL*).

**Financial Analysis**

Altria's financial health is characterized by declining revenues in its core business (though offset by price increases), stable operating margins, strong cash flows, high levels of debt, and share buybacks.  Its reinvestment needs are low, reflecting the limited growth opportunities in a mature industry. The company’s R&D intensity is low, since it is predominantly selling and distributing, not developing or improving, its product.

* **Revenues:** Declining in the smokeable product segment, offset by price increases, and flat to low growth in its oral tobacco segment.  
* **Margins:** Altria maintains a relatively high EBIT margin for a mature company, thanks to *Marlboro*'s pricing power. This is one of its moat characteristics.
* **Debt:**  High levels of debt are a concern, but the company generates more than enough cash flow to cover its interest expenses and remains well within the investment grade levels for coverage.
* **Capital Allocation:** Questionable. The *JUUL* investment was disastrous, and Altria has historically overpaid for acquisitions. Share buybacks are its main method of returning cash to shareholders.  
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** ROIC has declined over the past decade, hovering at levels close to its cost of capital. This indicates weak competitive advantage.


**Management Assessment**

Management's stewardship has been lackluster. The *JUUL* debacle raises serious questions about capital allocation skills, although in all fairness management, during the fourth quarter 2020 call, did say, "Our decision to make this investment was based on our analysis of JUUL's business, and is not something we took lightly. As such, I think we were all a bit surprised by the subsequent negative results of our operations. However, we'll continue to assess such situations and make similar investments in the future". In addition, insider ownership is low (less than 1%), and communication could be improved. Compensation for senior management is extremely high, even after the removal of Steve Jobs from our sample, as we can see in Altria's latest 10k and in the Journal of Corporate Finance, even for companies that generate relatively low returns.

Altria’s CEO said during the third quarter 2021 earnings call, “Our management is focused on building our business, not participating in activism. However, we welcome constructive investor dialogue and we recognize the significant improvement in ROIC in our smokeable product segment.”
