>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution (FY24):** North America (60.8%), Europe (23.7%), Rest of World (15.5%).
* **Industry Trends:** The IT services industry is growing, though more slowly over recent years due to macroeconomic weakness and increasing client focus on cost control. The industry has also seen substantial consolidation among providers.  Infosys operates in a highly competitive environment with numerous global and local players.
* **Margins:** Infosys’s operating margin has ranged between 20–25% of revenues over the past five years. Its cost of capital is relatively low at around 10%.
* **Growth:** Infosys has delivered revenue growth of 13.4% (compounded annual growth rate) over the past five years. 

**Moat Analysis**

Infosys has a narrow moat, primarily based on **switching costs** and **intangible assets** (brand).

* **Switching Costs:**  Infosys’s clients, typically large corporations, have integrated Infosys's services deeply into their operations. Switching to a new vendor can be disruptive and costly, creating significant switching costs. While these costs are real, they might not be enough to create a wide moat. <mark>As technology evolves, switching costs can become less potent if competitors offer better, simpler, or cheaper solutions.</mark>
* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Infosys enjoys high brand recognition within the IT services industry. It is known for its scale, global delivery model, and consulting expertise. However, brand name alone cannot be the source of sustainable pricing power. <mark>Many other IT service providers offer similar services, and differentiating based on brand is not easy. Moreover, the commoditization of certain IT services puts pressure on pricing, further weakening the brand advantage.</mark>
* **Other Potential Moat Sources:**  Infosys’s consulting expertise, scale, and global delivery network can be sources of cost and resource advantages, which might create a competitive advantage. However, <mark>competitors have also developed similar capabilities, making these sources of advantage less significant</mark> for Infosys. 
* **Moat Trend:** <mark>Infosys's moat might be eroding</mark> due to increasing competition, evolving technology (that can reduce switching costs), and a shift in the IT industry toward smaller, more nimble players.

**Valuation**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Infosys, with a pessimistic and conservative outlook.

**Assumptions**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth will gradually decline over the next five years from 8% (in constant Indian Rupees) to 6% in perpetuity, mirroring the long-run historical revenue growth of the industry.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume operating margins will improve to 21% over the next 10 years and stabilize at 20% in perpetuity, which is in line with the industry average but below what many packaged consumer-goods companies can maintain.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 20%, computed as: (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation + Change in Noncash Working Capital) / Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes (NOPLAT). Given increasing competition, it is likely that reinvestment will need to increase over the long term to maintain a 6% growth rate in perpetuity. 
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 11%.

    * **Cost of Equity:** 12.00% (Risk-free rate: 6.5%, Equity Risk Premium: 5%, Beta: 1.1)
    * **Cost of Debt:** 4.25% (Yield to Maturity on Infosys Corporate Bonds)
    * **Tax Rate:** 25% (based on historical analysis)
    * **Capital Structure:** 20% debt and 80% equity (based on industry average)
* **Probability of Failure:** Infosys is a stable company with low failure probability.  It has significant scale and operations in the developed world, all of which make a near-term implosion less likely. The probability of failure is set at 0.05. 
* **Liquidation Value:** Set at 25% of total invested capital, if the company was forced to liquidate (sell) all its tangible and intangible assets.

**Calculations**

1. **Forecast period (10 years):** Project revenues, operating income, operating expenses, capital expenditures, working capital, and free cash flow for the next 10 years. The financial projections can be found in the Excel workbook attached with this report.
2. **Terminal Value:** Use the perpetual-growth formula from Chapter 10 to estimate the terminal value at the end of year 10.

```
Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 11 × (1 − Reinvestment rate)) / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate)
Terminal Value = ($2,521.11 × (1−0.10) / (0.11 −0.06) = $45,836.36 million
```

3. **Present Value:** Discount the terminal value and the free cash flows from the forecast period back to today at the WACC. The resulting present values are presented in the Excel workbook.
4. **Enterprise Value:** Sum the present value of the terminal value and the present value of the cash flows during the explicit forecast period. 
5. **Value of Equity:** Subtract total debt from the Enterprise Value and add back excess cash and marketable securities. 
6. **Value per Share:** Divide the value of equity by the number of outstanding shares. 

<mark>The DCF model yields a value per share of $13.40 for Infosys.</mark>

**Conclusion**

<mark>Infosys seems to be fairly valued at its current price. Given the increasing competition, the evolving industry dynamics, and the company's dependence on acquiring businesses to grow, I am skeptical about the long-term sustainability of Infosys’s returns on capital.</mark> There is no significant margin of safety. <mark>The valuation is sensitive to growth expectations, and a more pessimistic forecast would yield a significantly lower valuation. For these reasons, I would suggest a modest rating of 2/5 for the company's moat and a cautious outlook.</mark>
