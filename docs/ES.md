{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Eversource earns a narrow moat rating of 3 out of 5.  This is because regulated utilities benefit from high barriers to entry, owing to the enormous costs and protracted timelines associated with developing large-scale energy infrastructure projects. It would take years for a competitor to build a competing transmission network (or acquire one), pass regulatory muster, and then earn enough on the new project to justify its expenditure. As the CEO of Eversource stated in the Q4 2020 earnings call, "The last thing the market really needs is overbuilding." Further protection for utilities is often granted by state and local governments, giving them effective monopolies or oligopolies over service areas. Additionally, as CEO, Joseph Nolan stated in the Q1 2021 earnings call, Eversource benefits from being one of the few utilities in the region serving three states, allowing the firm to share some of its fixed costs across state lines.

However, it is important to consider that the regulatory compact is not set in stone. In fact, as discussed in the Q2 2011 earnings call, there is pressure in the U.S. to increase the speed of renewable energy development, forcing utilities to adapt to a changed competitive environment. The shift from traditional fossil fuel and nuclear power sources toward renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydropower, batteries, and geothermal energy, is likely to increase costs, at least initially. This also reduces the company's ability to extract excess returns from a customer base because there is no clear competitive advantage.

**Management:**

Eversource earns a mediocre management rating of 2 out of 5. There are several justifications for this below-average rating:

* **Financial Performance:** Eversource's returns on invested capital (ROIC), without goodwill, have decreased over recent years. Although the company still earns positive economic profits, the decreasing ROIC is a cause for concern. A good management team would demonstrate the ability to find and capitalize on new opportunities to maintain ROIC above WACC.
* **Capital Allocation:** While Eversource’s management team has taken significant steps to reduce the firm’s debt load, they have historically been aggressive in making acquisitions, including a premium offer for Aquarion, which is now part of Eversource’s water utility business. Eversource did not give up easily in acquiring Aquarion and persisted in increasing their offer price several times before the purchase was finalized. Research reveals that acquirers often overestimate synergies and pay substantial premiums to sellers, and that there is often little or no value creation for shareholders (Damodaran, "Mergers and Acquisitions"). A better management team would be more disciplined in making acquisition decisions. As CEO, James J. Judge stated in the Q3 2007 earnings call, "Our first several years of experience did not fully prepare us for a fully electronic, fast-moving capital market."
* **Compensation:** While some of Eversource's executives have a significant portion of their compensation tied up in performance-based bonuses, there is no long-term incentive portion, such as restricted stock. Further, as noted in Eversource’s 2022 10-K, several senior officers hold relatively small amounts of Eversource stock. This gives an incentive to manage to quarterly results rather than long-term value creation. As noted in "The Essays of Warren Buffett," stock options are the softer they fall on the financial statement, hence, less deserving of the corporate manager’s emphasis.
* **Communication:** Eversource's executives have become more attuned to providing guidance to shareholders about anticipated revenues, earnings, and capital expenditures for upcoming years. But a thoughtful investor should examine a company’s financials from a historical basis as well as an intrinsic basis and use judgment to supplement the forward-looking forecasts. As noted in "Valuation", you should never attempt to take advantage of any perceived market anomalies unless you are very sure of both your facts and their interpretation, and, finally, you are prepared to be tough.
* **Insider Ownership:** As noted in Eversource’s 2022 10-K, although some officers hold significant numbers of shares, there are a few exceptions. Research has demonstrated that the quality of a company’s management team is best judged by a manager’s walk, not by his or her talk. The larger an officer’s or director’s stake, the more likely he or she is to act as an intelligent owner, as emphasized in "The Intelligent Investor"

**Catalyst:**

Eversource earns a low catalyst rating of 1 out of 5. The company's business model is based on providing a regulated service at a regulated price, and its primary source of growth is making continued investments in infrastructure in anticipation of economic growth. No doubt there will be occasional opportunities arising from an overvalued acquisition target, or a spin-off candidate priced irrationally on its business fundamentals. But, overall, there is nothing to indicate that this company has any near-term, above-average, growth potential. Hence, there are no clearly identifiable specific catalysts for the company.

**Valuation:**

{: .note }

To estimate Eversource’s intrinsic value, a three-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis was employed. 

The following key assumptions were used in the DCF model, which are designed to reflect economic realities and are in line with historical precedents. These values were discounted using a 6.85 percent cost of capital to derive the present value of each cash flow.

| Assumption                    | Value    | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :----------------------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Revenue Growth (Years 1-5)       | 2%       | Reflects estimated long-term nominal U.S. GDP growth. This estimate comes from a regression analysis of internally generated intangible assets and reflects inflation in the consumer basket and reflects economic activity                                              |
| Operating Margin               | 28.8%    |  Reflects company’s average operating margin over the past 10 years. This is a conservative estimate, as margins may decline in the medium term due to increased competition in the utility sector                                                         |
| Tax Rate                       | 26%      | Reflects company’s average effective tax rate over the past three years. A clean measure of cash taxes should be used. The statutory rate (typical for companies and then adjusted to reflect company-specific characteristics is too crude for valuation purposes. |
| Reinvestment Rate              | 59%      | Reflects company’s average reinvestment rate (Capital Expenditure - Depreciation + Change in non-cash working capital) over the past 10 years. This is a conservative estimate given company management's current stated intent to decrease leverage.           |
| Return on Capital (RONIC)    | 11%      | Reflects company’s average ROIC, excluding goodwill, over the past five years. This is a conservative estimate, as discussed in the Q1 2021 earnings call there has been a sustained ROIC decay.                                                        |
| Revenue Growth (Stable Growth)   | 3%       |  Reflects estimated long-term real U.S. GDP growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RONIC (Stable Growth)        | 7%       |  Reflects company’s cost of capital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

{: .important }

Discounting the cash flows at the cost of capital (6.85%) and applying a continuing value formula, calculated assuming a 3 percent growth rate in perpetuity and 7 percent RONIC, yielded a total enterprise value of \$32.79 billion.

This valuation resulted in an intrinsic value per share estimate of approximately \$55.35, based on the most recently reported number of shares outstanding, and after netting out the value of non-operating assets, debt and other non-equity claims, employee stock options, etc.

**Additional Considerations from Earnings Calls and Regulatory Filings:**

* **2023 Proxy Statement:** Eversource’s management team indicated its intention to increase dividend payout ratio to 65-70 percent over the next five years. While a large dividend increase in the near term is an attractive measure for dividend investors, this will put an end to buybacks and reduce the reinvestment rate in the core business.  The company believes it is in the best interest of the long-term shareholder to reinvest earnings at a high rate so long as incremental returns on capital are high. Research suggests that paying current dividend yields less favorable results than reinvesting in the core business where such retention can be counted on to produce steadily growing earnings.
* **CL&P- NSTAR 2021 Annual Report, Form 10K:**
   *  NSTAR purchased the assets of Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation (CNNG) in 2018 for $3.4 billion. The CNNG acquisition created a pipeline business within NSTAR, providing an anchor for a broader regulated business.

* **CL&P-NSTAR-PSNH 2023 Annual Report, Form 10K:**
  * NSTAR Gas’s business increased with the acquisition of Eversource Gas of Connecticut and its subsidiaries (formerly Yankee Gas Services) in 2017 for $1.2 billion. This demonstrates the importance of regulated acquisitions for Eversource, given that the amount of economic profit the company generates is a function of the regulatory compact. NSTAR now operates three gas businesses — Yankee, Connecticut Natural Gas, and Public Service of New Hampshire — each a regulated monopoly in its service territory.  This provides some indication of the company's business strategy and how the company allocates capital to support long-term growth.



**Potential Future Scenarios:**

* **Base Case:** Eversource's core businesses will continue to grow in line with economic growth in the regions it serves, driven by organic growth in existing markets. Acquisitions and capital expenditures will be made in utility infrastructure. This scenario should yield stable revenue growth and ROIC.
* **Aggressive Growth:** Eversource will increase its acquisition targets. The higher revenue growth that will occur through such acquisitions will need to be more than offset by the reduction in ROICs in order for such a strategy to succeed. This scenario should yield higher revenue growth but lower ROIC.
* **Downside Scenario:** There will be pressure on the utility sector to increase costs due to the U.S. government’s push towards renewable energy. Eversource may be forced to reduce its growth expectations. This scenario should yield lower revenue growth and ROIC.
