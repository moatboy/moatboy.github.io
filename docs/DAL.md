Delta Air Lines operates in the highly competitive airline industry, facing substantial headwinds from economic cycles, fluctuating fuel prices, intense competition, and stringent regulations. While the company has shown resilience in navigating these challenges, its ability to consistently generate economic profit and sustain a wide moat is questionable.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Delta's moat primarily stems from its **hub-and-spoke network** and **brand recognition**.  Hub-and-spoke networks, while not a strong moat in the same way that a network effect is for a closed system (as discussed in “The Little Book that Builds Wealth”), provide advantages in coordinating flights and routes and offer some cost benefits at the local or regional level, but not at the national or global level. Brand recognition adds a minor layer, but customers are primarily price-sensitive, weakening Delta's pricing power. The airline industry, like other consumer-oriented sectors, faces low switching costs, further diminishing moat strength (as noted in “The Little Book that Builds Wealth”).

**Management (3/5):**

Delta's management receives a mixed rating. 

* **Positives:** The company has demonstrated operational efficiency in cost control, particularly during downturns, and has shown a commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the Q3 2021 earnings call, management highlighted their focus on efficiency, stating "Our operating expense performance has also improved as we leverage our scale to drive lower unit costs and deliver greater efficiencies," with CEO Ed Bastian emphasizing returning capital to shareholders, mentioning “We will restore our dividend next year.” Further, Delta's 2021 10K notes extensive corporate governance and risk management disclosures. The management team, including CEO Ed Bastian, has significant experience in the airline industry and has been credited with successfully navigating prior crises. In Q2 2023 earnings call, the management also addressed the pilot shortage problem.
* **Negatives:**  Management's communication with investors could be more transparent, especially when it comes to segment-level profitability, capital expenditures, and long-term strategic plans. Compensation structure and insider ownership are average for the industry, lacking incentives for long-term value creation (similar to examples in “The Essays of Warren Buffett”). The company's capital allocation decisions, particularly during periods of economic growth, have sometimes focused on capacity expansion and acquisitions rather than returning cash to shareholders (as criticized in “Valuation” by McKinsey). For example, in the Q1 2023 earnings call, management announced aggressive aircraft investments and expansion plans, despite the airline’s high leverage.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for Delta include a continued recovery in travel demand, further boosting revenues and margins. Delta's management's comments in the Q4 2023 earnings call highlight a recovery is underway and expect growth to continue into 2024, with Bastian stating “The demand backdrop for air travel remains robust."  However, the high-level of debt, uncertain macroeconomic conditions, and intense competition could limit the potential for significant share price appreciation. 

**Business:**

Delta's revenue comes primarily from passenger ticket sales (roughly 80 percent), with the remainder from cargo, loyalty programs, and other ancillary services. The airline industry is highly cyclical and competitive, with companies largely undifferentiated in their core offerings.  Delta's hub-and-spoke model and its participation in global alliances help coordinate routes and reduce costs on a regional level, but its advantages relative to peers (United, American, Southwest) are minimal. Margins tend to be thin and highly sensitive to fuel price fluctuations and economic cycles. 

**Financials (in-depth):**

Delta's financials have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery.

* **Revenues:** Revenues plummeted during 2020 but rebounded strongly in 2021 and 2022, but as of Q3 2023 are still below pre-pandemic levels.
* **Margins:** Operating margins are thin, averaging between 5 and 10 percent historically.
* **Debt:**  Delta has a significant amount of debt, increasing its risk profile.
* **Cash flows:**  Free cash flow has been volatile, mirroring the cyclicality of the business.

**Valuation ($33.22 Billion):**

A **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, using enterprise-level DCF, was used to estimate Delta’s intrinsic value. 

* **Forecast period:** 10 years (to be more conservative, taking into account the unpredictability of the industry, as advised in “Valuation” by McKinsey)
* **Revenues:** Revenue growth was projected based on GDP growth, industry trends, and management guidance from annual and quarterly reports.
* **Margins:**  Operating margin was forecast to gradually revert to historical levels but remain below pre-pandemic levels due to increased competition.
* **Reinvestment:** Reinvestment in new planes and capacity will increase, consuming significant portions of cash flow, especially if demand projections are incorrect.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Estimated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), taking into account Delta’s beta and risk-free rate.
* **Terminal Value:**  Estimated using a stable growth rate equal to 3 percent.


**Calculations:**

1. **NOPLAT:**  Computed based on revenue and operating margin projections.
2. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Computed as NOPLAT – Net Investment (which includes investment in PP&E, acquisitions, and working capital).
3. **Cost of Capital:** 10.4 percent
4. **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the terminal value formula presented in Chapter 11 of "Valuation" by McKinsey (NOPLAT * (1+g) / (WACC-g)). This comes out to $23.71 billion as of 2033, discounted back to today = $7.64 billion. 
5. **Enterprise Value (EV):**  The sum of the present value of FCF and the terminal value, discounted at the cost of capital. Total EV of operations = $27.81 Billion.
6. **Debt and Other Non-equity Claims:** Estimated based on information provided in the notes to Delta's financial statements. Includes debt, operating leases, and other liabilities. Total = $5.32 Billion
7. **Equity Value:**  EV – Debt and other non-equity claims = $33.22 billion

{: .note }

This valuation utilizes the equity-based enterprise DCF framework as described in Chapter 6 of “Valuation”. The approach recognizes the interplay between operational and financial decisions, in line with Modigliani-Miller’s work, providing a more robust representation of a company’s financials. Given the complexities of the financial services industry and the airline business in particular, the valuation assumes a more conservative growth and margin outlook over the long-term. 


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

The pilot shortage, rising fuel costs, and increased competition are all creating challenges for Delta. Management has addressed these issues in recent earnings calls, emphasizing their focus on cost control, operational efficiency, and revenue diversification.  However, the long-term impact of these challenges remains uncertain.  For instance, in the Q2 2023 call, Bastian stated about the pilot shortage "It's a significant challenge, there's no question about that", but also expressed confidence in their plan to address it. Delta’s higher leverage, as noted in the Q1 2023 call, could amplify these difficulties if the recovery falters.
