Pessimistic value: $50 B

Hershey's dominates the US chocolate market, holding a substantial 46% share. This, coupled with its brand recognition, gives it some pricing power and constitutes a narrow moat.  It has some diversification with its salty snacks business, which reduces earnings volatility but has only low-to-moderate profitability. However, its moat faces a few challenges that prevent it from being wider:

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


1. **Limited Global Reach:** While it has some international presence, Hershey’s is primarily a US company. This geographic concentration increases its vulnerability to domestic economic downturns and limits its growth potential, compared to global food and beverage giants like Nestle and PepsiCo.

2. **Changing Consumer Preferences:**  Consumers are increasingly health-conscious, which presents a headwind for a company selling sugary treats. While Hershey's has introduced some healthier options, these have not yet become major revenue drivers.  This trend necessitates continued adaptation and innovation to maintain its market share.  In the Q4 2023 earnings call, the CEO said they are aware of the demand for “better-for-you” snacks and working on new offerings, but the company's revenue growth has been modest over the last decade, relative to many of its peers.

3. **Private Label Competition:** The company faces competition from private label brands, especially in the more price-sensitive segments of the market. This can put pressure on margins and force Hershey's to compete on price, eroding its pricing power. In the Q2 2021 earnings call, the CEO said they are keeping a close eye on private label penetration and so far not seeing a major shift. However, as we saw in “The Little Book of Valuation”, this vigilance is important for any company with low customer switching costs. 

4. **Input Costs:** Like any food company, Hershey's is susceptible to fluctuations in raw material prices (sugar, cocoa, milk). While these can sometimes be passed on to consumers, the company's profitability can be impacted in the short term. They do use commodity hedges to partially offset this risk, but as the Q1 2023 earnings call showed, they do not fully offset volatility from raw material prices.

**Management Rating Justification:**

Hershey's management is rated a 3 because while they have delivered steady growth, their capital allocation decisions have been questionable, and their communication on valuation-relevant financial data can be more effective. Their incentives also partially disconnect from long-term value creation:

* **Capital Allocation:**  While Hershey's has a solid history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, some of its acquisition decisions have raised concerns. The purchase of Amplify Snack Brands for $1.6 billion in 2017 was criticized as being overpriced and has yielded only mixed results.  Acquisitions have driven some revenue growth, but the long-term returns are not impressive. In Q4 2022 earnings call, the management reaffirmed that acquisitions will continue to be a part of the long-term revenue growth plan.  This raises questions about whether the premiums on acquisitions are too high relative to subsequent revenue and cost synergies.

* **Compensation:**  While Hershey’s management compensation is partially tied to company performance, it also includes a substantial portion of stock options. As Michael Mauboussin rightly points out, this can sometimes disincentivize value-creating decisions. 

* **Communication:**  Hershey's financial disclosures could be more transparent, providing more insight into the underlying economics of the company.  In particular, they provide little granular data about their individual business units and brands, which would allow analysts and investors to identify growth opportunities and better assess the value created by its business strategy. They provide some revenue breakout for each business segment, but few details about acquisitions, business development, or investment.

* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership at Hershey is modest, at less than 2%. This level of ownership is lower than average for its peer group and may not provide sufficient incentive for management to prioritize shareholder value creation over long-term horizons.

**Financials In-Depth:**

Hershey's financial performance has been steady but not spectacular. Revenues have grown at a modest rate, and margins have faced some pressure due to higher input costs and increased competition.

* **Revenues:**  Hershey's revenues are primarily derived from its North America Confectionery segment (chocolate, mint & gum and salty snacks). Its international business contributes a small but growing proportion of revenue. Its international growth is primarily organic, through their own distribution channels or joint ventures.

* **Margins:** The company's gross margins are healthy, but operating margins have declined slightly in recent years due to higher input costs and increased advertising spending. This spending is mainly to introduce the new Hersheyland experience in the US, to attract new customers to existing products or introduce new products.

* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Hershey's ROIC excluding Goodwill is fairly good at around 20%. This is a sign of a profitable and efficient business model. However, this number is inflated due to its brand name and not a reflection of managerial brilliance. It is in line with many of its peers. This would justify a moderately high valuation.

* **Capital Structure:**  The company has a conservative capital structure, with a debt-to-capital ratio of around 30%. This financial stability provides flexibility for acquisitions and share repurchases.

**Valuation:**

To arrive at a fair value of $50 billion, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used, with a terminal value approach. All valuation data used comes from a variety of sources that includes earnings calls, SEC filings, earnings releases and competitor information.

* **Revenue Growth:**  A long-term revenue growth rate of 3%, slightly below nominal GDP growth, was assumed, reflecting the maturity of the confectionery market and competition from healthier snacks.

* **Operating Margin:** A long-term operating margin of 20% was assumed, in line with its current level.

* **Reinvestment Rate:** A stable reinvestment rate of 50% was assumed, in line with the company's historical reinvestment policy.

* **Cost of Capital:**  A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7% was used, based on a 4% risk-free rate, a beta of 0.80, a market risk premium of 4%, and a cost of debt of 4%. These are all in line with the company's estimates. Note that we have not incorporated any country risk premium because the bulk of the earnings and value is in the US.

* **Terminal Value:** The terminal value calculation assumes the 3% revenue growth will continue perpetually, along with the same 20% margin and 50% reinvestment rate, and uses a 10% stable growth cost of capital. This high cost of capital reflects the uncertainty in making such long-term projections.  Note that it can be shown mathematically that the key-value driver formula and the growing perpetuity formula will deliver the same terminal value.

* **Nonoperating Assets:**  The value of nonoperating assets, which primarily takes the form of cash and marketable securities, and long-term equity investments was calculated as the market value of those assets as reported on its financial statements. The company's net debt (nonoperating liabilities - nonoperating assets excluding cash), was calculated and subtracted from the DCF-estimated value of operations. Nonoperating assets are valued as a going concern and not as a liquidation value.

* **Other Claims:**  There is no need to account for any management options, restricted stock, or convertible securities because we are valuing the firm using the equity cash flow (FCF) approach.  Furthermore, there are no other unusual non-equity claims that need to be factored into the valuation.

**Potential Catalysts:**

Hershey's catalyst rating is a 2. While there are no major catalysts on the horizon, the following factors could potentially boost the stock price:

* **International Expansion:** Successful expansion into emerging markets could unlock significant growth potential. The Q2 2023 earnings call showed they have been looking at new geographical markets, particularly in India and China. If successful, international expansion would create substantial value in the years ahead.

* **New Product Development:**  Hershey’s has been working on expanding its salty snacks business as well as on “better-for-you” offerings, to cater to evolving consumer preferences. The Q1 2023 earnings call revealed some success in these markets.  A breakthrough new product could re-accelerate revenue growth and expand its addressable market.
