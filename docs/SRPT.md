{: .highlight }
Sarepta's business model revolves around developing and commercializing gene therapy treatments for rare genetic diseases, where there is often limited competition but difficult regulatory requirements.

### Business Overview

Sarepta's revenues are almost entirely driven by sales of their three FDA-approved gene therapy products:
*   **EXONDYS 51**, **VYONDYS 53**, and **AMONDYS 45** are exon-skipping treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). While they are the same type of treatment, they each target different mutations.
*   **ELEVYS** a gene therapy to treat DMD patients.

{: .note }
All the products are marketed in the United States only, and although the company has been seeking ex-US approvals, they have faced hurdles in achieving commercial sales in Europe and other major markets.

*   The company has agreements with various partners to commercialize and manufacture products in other regions.
*   Sarepta’s revenue growth in the past 5 years has been tremendous, owing primarily to the uptake of its recently approved products.
*    The products are generally priced at premiums to other therapeutic treatments available to patients with similar indications.
*    However, sales have been volatile as some regions continue to have difficulties accessing the products.

### Industry Trends

*   The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and face a constant threat of disruption from competitors.
*   Within rare disease drug development, the FDA and other regulatory agencies provide special incentives, but the path to approval is arduous with high costs and lengthy processes.
*    Companies face ever-increasing costs of clinical trials, which makes cost management very important for profitability.
*  The landscape is also shifting toward gene therapies, which hold the potential for one-time, transformative treatments but are often met with high degrees of regulatory skepticism.

### Competitive Landscape

*   Sarepta operates in the highly specialized rare disease market, meaning competition isn't based on a broad market, but rather on treatments for specific ailments.
    *   Competition within their respective treatment categories, such as DMD, is high and ever increasing.
*   The main focus of a company lies in the ability to successfully develop and obtain approvals for new treatments.
*   The biggest competitor in general terms are companies with strong platforms in gene therapy and have greater R&D budget than Sarepta.
*   Some other big Pharma companies have an advantage due to their commercial infrastructure and economies of scale.

### What Makes Sarepta Different

*   Sarepta focuses almost entirely on genetic medicines to treat rare diseases.
*   The company has a strong history of bringing innovative treatments for DMD through regulatory approval.
*   Their long standing research and clinical development in exon-skipping technology has led to some important breakthroughs and has enabled development of ELEVYS.
*   The company has a diversified revenue base by having 3 products for DMD which targets different mutations of the disease.
*  The company’s primary source of moat comes from intellectual property and regulatory barriers from having approved products to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is hard to replicate.

### Financials in Detail

*   Revenues are solely derived from sales of products. For full year 2023 revenues were $902.5 million, an increase of 41.5% compared to full year of 2022 with $637.8 million.
*    Most of the revenue growth comes from increases in product sales for their already available products, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45, and the newly approved product ELEVYS.
*   The company’s net loss for 2023 was ($643.2) million vs ($853.6) million, in 2022. Company is not currently profitable.
*   R&D expenses are consistently high for the company, averaging more than half of revenues in the past few years. R&D expense for 2023 is $917.9 million.
*   SG&A is around 20% of sales. SG&A for 2023 is $365.5 million.
*   Gross margin for the company is roughly 70%.
*    Although the company has been generating huge revenues, the current profit structure is not suitable for achieving positive earnings, mainly due to heavy costs associated with research and development. 
*  The company has increased their debt over the past few years, with long-term debt now standing at $1.526 billion in 2023 from only $433 million in 2019.
*   The company had a total cash of $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

{: .warning }
Although the revenues have been increasing significantly due to their new products, the huge increase in R&D costs alongside general expenses, have made the path towards profitable revenues longer than expected.

### Recent Concerns / Controversies

*   In recent earnings calls, the management has stressed that they may need to seek additional funding in the future, as their expenses are predicted to remain very high in the coming years due to new product launches and development.
*   The company has had some struggles in ex-US approvals and commercialization of its products as discussed in the risk factors section.
*    Although the revenues for the existing product portfolio is showing a good momentum, commercial success for ELEVYS is very important to achieving the projected revenues in the coming years.

### Moat Assessment

*   **Intangible Assets:** Sarepta possesses intellectual property in the form of patents and regulatory exclusivities that protect their gene therapy drugs, especially their core business of treatment for DMD.

*   **Switching Costs:** Some switching costs may exist, but the therapies are intended for rare indications for which there is no other suitable treatment. These patients are likely to continue with the treatment until something better is available.

*   **Network Effects:** The network effect is not a significant aspect for the business.

*   **Cost Advantages:** Sarepta does not have sustainable cost advantages over its competitors. Most of its products are very high value and produced in small quantities making the cost structure similar to competitors.

Based on the above points, Sarepta has a narrow moat with an overall rating of **3/5**. The strength primarily arises from the patents and regulatory protection for their drugs.

### Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience

1.  **Regulatory Risks:** The company relies heavily on approvals and extensions of regulatory exclusivity. Any change in regulation could limit the commercial viability of their products.
2.  **Competition**: More companies are entering the space for gene therapy and DMD treatment. Companies with broader pipelines and platforms may make the market more competitive.
3.  **Clinical Trial Risks**: The success of a biotechnology company is tied to clinical trials. Any unforeseen setback could result in huge losses for the company.
4.  **Commercialization Risk:** Even if a product obtains FDA approval, commercialization and sales may fail to meet analyst expectations resulting in decline in valuation.
5.   **Manufacturing risks:** Given the complexity of biological molecules and gene therapy products, issues with manufacturing could arise, resulting in product shortage or supply disruption, and an inability to commercialize at scale.

While Sarepta is innovative, the success of the company is completely dependent on the success of their pipeline products, especially the gene therapy, ELEVYS. If this product fails to meet its expectations, then the entire company is at risk of not generating profits in future years. Despite these risks, Sarepta does show some resilience because of its lead in treating rare genetic disorders. The company has a good history of bringing treatments to the market, but this advantage can be overcome by competitors if the company fails to innovate or loses its current lead in the market.

### Understandability: 4 / 5
Sarepta's business is focused on gene therapy for rare diseases, which can be easily understood as a technology that enables the treatment of genetic disorders by correcting them on a molecular level. However, there may be some complexity in the nuances of their specific technicalities or the regulatory pathway to bring such therapies to market. The company's main products and their mechanism of action, while involving specialized technology, is also straightforward for an average investor to understand. 

### Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5
Sarepta's balance sheet reflects a growing company with a focus on innovation and expansion. There is no debt to worry about. However, their heavy capital spending is concerning. Therefore, the company is not the most financially stable, since it relies almost completely on revenues from current products to fund its R&D and operating expenses.
