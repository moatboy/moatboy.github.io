Occidental Petroleum is a complex energy company with operations spanning oil and gas exploration and production, chemical manufacturing, midstream and marketing, and low-carbon ventures. While it possesses some elements that contribute to a narrow moat, its dependence on commodity prices, questionable capital allocation decisions, and environmental concerns warrant a more cautious outlook.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

OXY operates in a highly competitive industry. While it enjoys some economies of scale, particularly in its Permian Basin operations, these advantages are not substantial enough to create a wide moat.  The company's chemical business, though profitable, also faces intense competition and does not provide any meaningful differentiation. The lack of pricing power inherent in commodity businesses necessitates a lower moat rating.  Its forays into low-carbon solutions have yet to show meaningful financial success and thus don't significantly enhance OXY's moat.

Switching costs for customers are minimal, further limiting the company's competitive advantage. Any company can produce oil and the price is the only purchase criteria.
Switching costs in the commodity chemical market, are low. Any company can produce the commodity chemical at the given quality.

**Management (2/5):**

While OXY's management team possesses industry experience, its recent track record raises some concerns.

* **Anadarko Acquisition:** The 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, financed largely with debt, significantly increased OXY's financial leverage and exposed the company to the oil price crash during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This acquisition, orchestrated by former CEO Vicki Hollub, proved to be ill-timed and expensive. 
* **Capital Allocation:** Management's focus on share buybacks, even when the stock was trading at a premium, raises concerns about capital allocation priorities.  This prioritization could have been detrimental to shareholders, especially given the subsequent decline in oil prices and the company's high debt load. In the Q2 2021 earnings call, Hollub noted share buybacks were among OXY's uses of cash. In the Q3 2023 earnings call, Hollub said, "We are going to allocate at least 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders."
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation has been substantial, despite the company's struggles.  This raises questions about management's alignment with shareholder interests.  In the 2019 10-k, it was disclosed that Hollub's annual salary was around $1 million, and that she also received stock awards.
* **Insider Ownership:** While some insiders have increased their ownership stakes, the overall level of insider ownership remains relatively low, further raising concerns about management's incentives.
* **Communication:** Management’s communication has been relatively opaque, with limited disclosures regarding specific operating segments. This lack of transparency makes it challenging for investors to fully evaluate OXY's business and growth prospects.

{: .warning }

There is an apparent management focus on increasing production, which is a red flag for value investors. Greater focus should be given to returns and profitability instead of just production. In the Q2 2021 earnings call, Hollub highlighted growing production volume as being among OXY's goals and priorities.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Rising oil prices:** OXY's financial performance is heavily dependent on oil prices. A sustained increase in oil prices would significantly improve the company's profitability and cash flow, potentially leading to debt reduction and increased shareholder returns. In the Q1 2024 earnings call, CEO Vicki Hollub, said "Occidental is ideally positioned to deliver sustainable free cash flow in a wide range of oil prices".
* **Low-carbon ventures:** Although these ventures are currently a small part of OXY's business, they have the potential to become significant contributors to growth and profitability in the long term if the company can successfully execute its strategy. In the Q1 2021 earnings call, President and CFO Robert Peterson, said "the low carbon ventures business unit exceeded our internal goals."
* **Debt Reduction:**  OXY's high debt load is a significant overhang on the stock. Any meaningful progress in reducing debt would be viewed positively by the market. In the Q3 2023 earnings call, Hollub discussed debt reduction being a priority for the company.

**Valuation ($46.19 Billion):**

{: .note }

Given the dependence on commodity prices and the challenges the industry faces, I'm using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with very conservative assumptions. This model includes provisions for company-specific risks related to acquisitions and operational challenges.
{: .note }


* **Revenue Growth:**  2% annual growth for the first five years, and 1% thereafter in line with long-run historical US economic growth. This assumption reflects the mature nature of the oil and gas industry and intense competition.
* **Operating Margin:** 10%, which is the trailing twelve month average operating margin reported in Q3 2023. We assume a drop down to 7% in the next few years. This reflects intensifying competition and margin pressure due to the commodity nature of the business. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on the previous year’s cash flows, we calculate a reinvestment rate of 54%. This accounts for the company’s high capital expenditure needs to maintain its existing operations and fund its growth initiatives.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% - A risk premium reflecting the inherent volatility and uncertainty of the business, as well as the company’s high debt load. This estimate uses the CAPM approach, with a risk-free rate of 4.5%, a market risk premium of 4.5%, and a beta of 1.27.  The current company debt interest rate of 6.8% and the marginal corporate tax rate of 25% are also incorporated to obtain the cost of capital. The company's target debt/equity ratio is 15% and 85% for debt and equity, respectively.
* **Terminal Value:**  Terminal growth of 1% with perpetuity. This assumes the very low long-term growth outlook for the oil and gas industry. The terminal value is derived by discounting cash flow growth at the cost of capital.


**Recent Concerns:**

* **Environmental liabilities:** OXY faces significant environmental liabilities related to its oil and gas operations. These liabilities could increase over time due to stricter environmental regulations and potential future litigation. The company disclosed in its 2023 10-k that it has accrued $2.211 billion for environmental liabilities.
* **ESG concerns:**  Growing investor focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues could negatively affect OXY's valuation, as some investors may be reluctant to invest in a company with a significant carbon footprint. During the Q1 2021 earnings call, an analyst asked about OXY's initiatives to lower its environmental impact, which Hollub stated were focused on managing methane emissions.
* **Geopolitical instability:** Political and economic instability in some of the countries where OXY operates, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, could negatively impact the company's production and profitability.
* **Commodity risk:** The continued shift towards alternative energy sources may reduce demand for oil and gas in the long term. In the Q2 2021 earnings call, an analyst asked about the long-term prospects for oil and gas, to which Hollub expressed a positive view but acknowledged the increasing demand for decarbonization.


**Conclusion:**

OXY is a company with some narrow moat characteristics, but it also faces significant headwinds, including commodity price volatility, a heavy debt burden, and environmental concerns. While the company's current valuation appears to be reasonable relative to its peers, conservative investors may want to wait for a wider margin of safety before investing.
