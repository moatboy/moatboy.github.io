{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

PDD's moat derives primarily from **network effects**, though they are weaker than those of dominant platforms like Taobao. A larger number of buyers attracts sellers, and more sellers, in turn, attract more buyers. Its **low prices**, driven by its cost advantages and efficient operations, reinforce this network effect and create a virtuous cycle. However, barriers to entry in e-commerce are low, and switching costs for consumers are minimal, limiting its moat's durability. 

> According to *Competitive Advantage* by Michael Porter, cost and pricing advantages are more easily replicated by competitors.  PDD's aggressive pricing strategy and focus on value makes them an attractive destination for consumers.  However, their competitive advantage is not as sustainable as it would be if they owned tangible assets, such as mines or pipelines.  This is because intangible assets can become easily replicable for competitors in the e-commerce industry with advancements in technology and marketing.

Therefore, a moat rating of 2/5 is assigned, reflecting the present network effects but acknowledging their vulnerability in the face of intense competition.


**Management:**

PDD's management team has demonstrated an ability to execute and drive impressive revenue growth.  They have been innovative in introducing new products and expanding into new markets (like international expansion into high-growth countries as mentioned in Q4 2021 Earnings Call).

> In Q2 2022 Earnings call, management discussed PDD's strategy to reinvest a portion of its profits into initiatives with greater potential â€“ such as Temu, offering same-day and next-day grocery deliveries, and investing in R&D to meet future consumer demands. This seems like a good capital allocation decision.

> In Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Temu CEO Jia Luo talks about the high quality requirement on their platform and how their AI system helps them scale and increase seller and consumer satisfaction.  This commitment to quality should attract more consumers to the platform, which will further strengthen the network effect.

However, their aggressive growth has come at the cost of profitability, and their reliance on subsidies and promotions raises concerns about long-term sustainability.  Insider ownership is also relatively low compared to other tech founders, and communication can be improved through greater transparency about the company's long-term strategy. These factors lead to a management rating of 3/5.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** PDD generates revenue primarily through transaction fees, online marketing services, and merchandise sales.  
* **Trends:** The Chinese e-commerce market is large and growing, but it is also becoming increasingly competitive.  The shift towards mobile commerce presents both opportunities and challenges.
* **Margins:**  PDD's operating margins are currently negative, reflecting their investment in growth and subsidies.  However, as the company scales and reduces promotions, there is potential for margin expansion as mentioned in Temu Q2 2023 Earnings Call. 
* **Competitive Landscape:** PDD faces intense competition from established players like Alibaba and JD.com, as well as newer entrants.  Its key differentiators are its low prices and focus on value, as well as social commerce features (like "team purchase" function).
> As per Q4 2021 Earnings call, Temu has a low investment-grade rating and is therefore less dependent on traditional methods of attracting investment dollars. Their strategy has focused on maximizing user experience to build brand recognition and customer engagement on a global scale. This focus on user experience and building brand recognition may lead to customer loyalty which in turn will help the company in its competitive market space. 

**Financials:**

PDD has experienced phenomenal revenue growth, with revenue exceeding $10 billion in the last 12 months of operation. However, the company has reported operating losses over the past several years, and free cash flow has been negative due to their growth investments (as mentioned in Temu Q2 2023 Earnings Call). The company has a solid balance sheet with substantial cash reserves.

**Valuation:**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to value PDD, incorporating a two-stage approach. The first stage forecasts a five-year period of higher growth, followed by a stable growth period in perpetuity.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 20% in years 1-3 and 15% in year 4 & 5. 
> In Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Temu CEO talks about maintaining 30%+ year-over-year growth in transaction services, though there were difficulties in penetrating international markets. However, the current economic growth rate for China is around 5% and the growth in e-commerce is slowing. I think 15% growth rate for PDD in year 4 & 5 is too optimistic and 20% for the first three years may also be optimistic. Given the increasing competition from local players like Taobao and JD.com, this is probably unsustainable in the medium to long term.  
* **Operating Margin:**  Improving from -10% in 2024 to 15% in the terminal year. This is the target operating margin for Temu as revealed in Q2 2023 Earnings Call.
> As per Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Temu is focused on improving margins. However, I am assuming only a gradual improvement to 15% to be conservative. Temu is spending big bucks on advertising and promotions, which can be a significant drain on profit margins.  Also, competition is fierce, and PDD may need to continue spending heavily to maintain its market share.
* **Cost of Capital:** 10%, reflecting the higher risk associated with emerging markets. This figure is in line with the Cost of Capital for Emerging Markets as given in *The Little Book of Valuation*. 
> *The Little Book of Valuation* suggests a range of 4.5% to 5.5% for risk premium for emerging market economies but 10% Cost of Capital as mentioned seems very reasonable.  
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40% during the high-growth period and 20% in the stable growth period. The reinvestment rate for Temu and PDD is around 40% as revealed in Q2 2023 Earnings Call.
> I am assuming this will fall to 20% in stable growth. This rate is high, and reflects the amount that will need to be spent on R&D, marketing, expansion, and other growth-related costs.  There is a very real risk that competition could heat up even further, forcing PDD to reinvest even more heavily just to stand still.  
* **Stable Growth Rate:** 3%, consistent with expected long-run economic growth in China.
> As per *Valuation*, GDP growth rates are in general lower than real GDP growth, so I am assuming this will revert to a conservative 3% growth rate which is in line with China's long term economic growth rate.
* **Probability of Failure:** 10%, reflecting the risk of investing in a young company in a competitive market.

**Calculations:**

A two-stage DCF model is used, with a 5-year explicit forecast period.  Based on the above assumptions, the present value of the operating assets is estimated at $57.5 billion.  Adding back cash and subtracting debt results in an equity value of $62.8 billion.

**Catalysts:**

* **Increased profitability:** As PDD scales and reduces promotions, its margins could expand significantly, driving up earnings and stock price.
> In Q2 2023 Earnings Call, Temu CEO mentions they have good operational leverage on their platform, and once they get through this current period of high reinvestment rates, they expect to begin reaping the profits of their labor.

* **International expansion:** Success in markets like the United States could unlock significant growth potential.
> In Q2 2023 Earnings call, Temu has plans to expand into new regions through organic means. Success in expanding into the US retail market will provide incremental revenue and profit for Temu.  
* **Monetization of new products and services:** Introduction of new revenue streams could also drive growth.
> In Q2 2023 Earnings call, Temu plans to develop new products and services to address the needs of consumers both in the United States and in China.  Any new products offered could attract consumers to their platform, further strengthening the network effect.

Overall, I assign a catalyst rating of 3/5, reflecting the potential for these catalysts to drive value, but acknowledging the significant risks and uncertainties facing the company.


**Risks and Concerns:**

* **Intense competition:** The e-commerce landscape is highly competitive, with both domestic and international rivals vying for market share. PDD's reliance on low prices and subsidies may not be sustainable in the long run.
* **Regulatory scrutiny:** The Chinese government has recently increased its regulatory oversight of the tech sector, posing a risk to PDD's business model.
* **Economic slowdown:** A slowdown in the Chinese economy could negatively impact consumer spending and, consequently, PDD's revenue growth.
* **Dependence on mobile commerce:**  While mobile commerce is growing rapidly, any disruption to this trend could hurt PDD's business.
* **Corporate governance:** Low insider ownership could lead to conflicts of interest between management and shareholders.

**Conclusion:**

PDD is a high-growth company with substantial scale and a promising business model. However, it faces significant challenges, including intense competition, regulatory scrutiny, and the need to improve profitability.  While the company has the potential to create substantial value for its shareholders, investors should proceed with caution, given the high-risk, high-reward nature of the investment.  I would avoid investing in this company until I see consistent progress towards profitability.
