FRHC's revenue mix is evolving, with an increasing emphasis on its banking and insurance operations alongside traditional brokerage.

### Trends in the Industry

*   **Banking**: Competitors include local and international banks.
*   **Insurance**: The landscape includes many international and regional insurance providers.
*   **Financial services industry in general**: Highly regulated with high capital and compliance requirements, there's an emphasis on digitalization and technology.

{: .warning }
The financial services industry is subject to rapid and ongoing change, which can affect the competitive landscape and require strong regulatory compliance capabilities.

### What Makes FRHC Different?

*   **Integrated Services:** FRHC offers a diverse range of financial services under one roof, from brokerage to banking.
*   **Technology Focus:** FRHC is continuously investing in the latest technologies to serve its clients better.

*   **Revenue:** FRHC has generated substantial revenue growth over recent years, but profitability has been variable, as a portion of revenues are dependent on brokerage and trading activities.
*   **Profitability**: The firm has high operating expenses, limiting profits, especially considering that it also has high debt.
*   **Cash flow**: Cash flow from operations is unpredictable.

### Key Metrics and Justification
* **Moat Rating:** 2 / 5
{: .note }
While FRHC enjoys some competitive advantages, mainly related to its diverse range of financial services and strong regional presence, its competitive landscape is becoming extremely challenging, and the company has limited pricing power or brand influence, limiting its moat.

1. **Intangible Assets:** The Company has some brand recognition in Kazakhstan, but this is not particularly strong in other regions, and these brands are not hard to copy. The Company does have a significant regulatory advantage in the brokerage industry, which provides limited barriers to entry but at the same time, other competitors can obtain the license too.
2.  **Switching Costs**: Switching costs do exist within the company's own various offerings but there is not one main service they provide for the customers to experience high switching costs.
3.  **Network Economics**: The company doesn't have any considerable network economics that can give it a competitive advantage.
4.  **Cost Advantage:** Though the company tries to minimize their operating costs, and attempts to get low costs using digitalized technologies, it doesn't seem to give it a major competitive advantage when comparing it to competitors.

* **Understandability Rating:** 4 / 5
{: .note }
FRHC’s business model is quite complex but can be understood with focused study of its components. A better understanding of the industry is required to have a great understanding of its operations.
*   Its diverse business model requires a decent understanding of several financial areas.
*   The company’s international operations add complexity to its business operations.

* **Balance Sheet Health Rating:** 3 / 5

1.  **Debt:** The company has a high level of total liabilities compared to its assets, with total assets at $8,363 million, total liabilities at $5,315 million and share holders equity at $3,048 million. Although their debt is not a primary cause of concern, it can make the company more risky, especially during economic turbulence.
2.  **Liquidity:** FRHC's total cash and cash equivalents at $1,375 million may seem healthy, but due to market uncertainty, a high percentage of debt as well as fluctuating profitability, it may face some liquidity challenges.
3.  **Solvency:** The company’s total liabilities are greater than half of its assets, meaning the company is reliant on borrowing to fund the activities.

### Risks
The key risks for FRHC include:
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The company is subject to financial regulations in multiple jurisdictions, so regulatory changes or fines could substantially affect its operations.
*   **Market Risk**: FRHC’s reliance on trading volumes leaves it vulnerable to market volatility.
*   **Credit Risk:** The company has significant loan activity, making it vulnerable to bad debts if they are not properly collateralized.
*   **Geopolitical Risk:** The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the economic instability in Kazakhstan can affect FRHC's operations and market sentiment.
*   **Execution Risk:** Expansion efforts in new regions and implementation of new technology may not go as planned.
*   **Cybersecurity risk**

### Business Resilience
While FRHC operates in a volatile environment, it has a diverse revenue stream and geographic coverage. However, the reliance on emerging economies and a high level of debt do give cause for concern.

## Latest Concerns and Controversies
*   **Sanctions Impact**: The company's exposure to the Russian market and sanctions compliance was a significant concern, resulting in the removal of a Russian subsidiary from the company's operations and impacting their revenue.
*   **Russia-Ukraine War**: The ongoing war, and related economic uncertainty, is having a significant, negative impact on the company's revenue.
*   **Increased Credit Risk**: The company’s loan portfolio has increased significantly with higher exposure to consumers with poorer credit ratings.
*   **Compliance Issues:** Some investors are concerned about the compliance risks of the company's multi-national operations.
*   **Management Turnover:** There have been a number of executive changes, causing potential instability in the management.

{: .important }
Management continues to implement various programs designed to further develop and expand their operations, including improvements in financial reporting, compliance with regulations and risk management procedures.

**In summary**, while Freedom Holding Corp has a diverse business model and is operating in fast-growing markets, the company is faced with several risks. It is a decent play for a very high risk investor.
