### Moat Rating
2 / 5
*   **Justification:**  While Sun Life has several factors going for it, including its diverse operations and brand recognition, it has several challenges in order to establish a wider moat. While these factors do act to reduce the odds of competitors getting easy market share, they don't make the company impenetrable or significantly improve their profits on a consistent basis.
     *   **Limited Pricing Power**: The company has limited pricing power. It still operates in highly commoditized markets where customers can easily swap insurers. While it benefits from high customer lock-in and switching costs, this doesn't always translate to higher profits, since these switching costs also apply to their competition.
    * **Competitive Industry**:  The financial services sector is very competitive. It is difficult to obtain and sustain a truly wide moat due to low barriers to entry and a huge availability of close substitutes. Even if a company is able to innovate, it is very easy for the other companies to quickly adopt any new features and benefits.

### Understandability Rating
3 / 5
*   **Justification**:
     * Sun Life is a large and complex enterprise. Understanding its structure and the interaction of its various subsidiaries can be difficult.
    * The financial metrics for evaluating insurance firms are also difficult for novice investors to grasp. Analyzing its business segments can also be tricky.
    * However, at a high level, understanding the basic services of insurance, asset management, and wealth management are easy for the average investor to understand, which is why we give the company a 3 rather than anything higher.
     * The company has taken effort to simplify their reporting but investors will still need some experience to understand some of its financial data.

### Balance Sheet Health Rating
4 / 5
*  **Justification**:
    *  Sun Life maintains a strong capital position, which has enabled it to manage financial shocks.
  * The company has an optimal debt-to-equity ratio, showing good balance sheet management. Although they are still trying to optimize their capital structure.
  * They maintain good liquidity in order to meet their short-term liabilities.
  * The company has a lot of assets on its balance sheet, most of which are in investments, indicating low-risk nature.
    *  While a lot of the financials of insurance businesses are difficult to analyze, given what is publicly available, Sun Life seems to have a good overall balance sheet and capital structure.
