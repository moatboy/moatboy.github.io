>The moat rating, management rating, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat: 4 / 5**

Berkshire's wide moat stems primarily from several sources:

* **Brands:** Several subsidiaries, such as GEICO (insurance), Duracell (batteries), and Fruit of the Loom (clothing), possess powerful brands that enjoy pricing power and customer loyalty.  As Warren Buffett noted in the 1989 shareholder letter, "A truly great business must have an enduring 'moat' that protects excellent returns on invested capital." This concept is echoed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, which emphasizes the importance of sustainable competitive advantages.
* **Switching Costs:**  In the insurance and utility businesses, switching costs create a significant barrier to entry. Customers are reluctant to change insurers or utility providers due to the hassle and potential disruption.  This "stickiness" enhances customer retention and pricing power, as discussed in Dorsey's book.
* **Network Effect:** While not as prevalent as in technology companies, Berkshire benefits from the network effect in some areas.  For instance, BNSF Railway's vast network provides economies of scale and makes it a critical link in the North American supply chain, increasing its bargaining power with shippers.  This is similar to the examples provided in Dorsey's book of network effects in third-party logistics providers like C.H. Robinson.
* **Cost Advantage/Scale:**  GEICO has a cost advantage stemming from its direct-to-consumer business model.  BNSF Railway's scale also provides a cost advantage, and Berkshire’s insurance operations generate a substantial float, which provides low-cost capital.  These advantages are discussed in both Dorsey's book and *Valuation* by McKinsey.

However, it's important to note that while Berkshire's subsidiaries operate in some industries with moats, other businesses, such as its manufacturing operations, face tougher competition and have narrower or no moats.  Also, the competitive landscape is constantly evolving, so some previously strong moats can erode, as illustrated by the examples in Dorsey's book.


**Management: 5 / 5**

Berkshire's management, led by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, deserves the highest rating due to their exceptional track record, shareholder-friendly practices, and disciplined capital allocation decisions.

* **Exceptional Track Record:** Over decades, Berkshire has consistently outperformed the market, generating exceptional returns for shareholders. As Buffett mentioned in the 2006 shareholder letter about the company’s acquisition of Clayton Homes,  "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."  This long-term focus is a key takeaway from Benjamin Graham's *The Intelligent Investor*.
* **Shareholder-Friendly Practices:** Berkshire eschews stock splits, excessive executive compensation, and earnings manipulation, focusing instead on long-term value creation.  This owner-centric approach aligns management’s interests with those of shareholders, as discussed in Graham's book.  Furthermore, Berkshire’s history of repurchasing shares at prices below intrinsic value demonstrates prudent capital allocation.  
* **Disciplined Capital Allocation:** Berkshire's decentralized structure allows subsidiary managers to make operational decisions while Buffett and Munger focus on large capital allocation decisions. Their disciplined approach to acquisitions and share repurchases, seeking bargains and avoiding overpaying, has been crucial to the company's success. This approach is consistent with the principles of value investing championed by Graham.

However, it is important to be mindful of key-person risk.  While Berkshire has a deep bench of talented managers, Buffett and Munger's eventual departure will be a significant event.  The company’s decentralized structure mitigates this risk, as noted in many discussions about management quality in  *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* by Philip Fisher, but it remains a key consideration.


**Business:**

Berkshire operates in diverse sectors.  Here's a look at its key businesses:

* **Insurance:**  GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and other insurance subsidiaries generate a significant portion of Berkshire's earnings and provide a large float.  The insurance business is susceptible to catastrophic events and the insurance cycle, as discussed in *Valuation*.  
* **Railroads:** BNSF Railway is a crucial part of the North American freight transportation network.  The railroad business is cyclical, capital-intensive, and influenced by regulations and economic conditions.
* **Utilities:** Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns regulated utilities, which provide stable but lower-return earnings. This segment is susceptible to changes in regulations and environmental concerns.
* **Manufacturing, Service, and Retailing:**  This segment encompasses a broad range of businesses, from clothing and furniture to industrial equipment and jewelry.  Many of these businesses face significant competition, and the competitive dynamics and profit potential vary significantly between sectors.

**Valuation: $480 billion**

{: .important }

We used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate Berkshire’s intrinsic value.  We focused on the company's operating earnings and free cash flow, which are the best indicators of the economic reality of the business, and made our estimates on a consolidated basis.  We used the following key assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** We assumed an average annual growth rate of 1.5 percent in line with Nominal US GDP growth for the next five years, given global macroeconomic uncertainties.  We expect Berkshire to reduce its dependence on growth through acquisitions or share buybacks over the next several years. We expect Berkshire to focus on improving profitability in existing businesses versus adding new acquisitions.
* **Operating Margins:** We expect operating margins to remain stable at around 18 percent of revenues (Trailing 12 month operating margin of 18.25% as of June 2024) across its businesses.  
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assumed an average reinvestment rate of 20% for the next five years. Beyond the first five years, we expect Berkshire’s reinvestment rate to fall to 10% as the company matures.
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimated Berkshire's cost of capital at 7.56 percent (Based on a WACC calculation using current market conditions and a leverage assumption, weighted average of equity and debt using current market value ratios)

{: .warning }

Given the current market volatility, we have assigned a lower probability of 30% to a base case with the above assumptions (1.5% growth, 18% margin and 20% reinvestment).  We have used a DCF model to project cashflows for 10 years.

For our other 70% probability, we expect Berkshire to deliver the 7% annual return it has delivered for the shareholders of its company since 1965. In other words, with a starting equity value at the end of June 2024 of $710 Billion dollars, we expect Berkshire to grow to $1.37 Trillion by June 2034. In 10 Years' Time.

The 3P test would suggest this is reasonable.
* **Possible:**  Berkshire Hathaway is a large company with a long history, with more than sufficient resources to generate the cash necessary to grow and achieve goals.
* **Plausible:** Berkshire Hathaway has a long record of achievement and success. The track record suggests that the possibility of success for Berkshire is highly likely.
* **Probable:** Berkshire Hathaway's track record and its current business situation suggest the likelihood of success for Berkshire is more than plausible and closer to a certainty.

We also incorporated the risk of management changes at Berkshire, given the company's dependence on the experience and wisdom of its current leadership team.
Based on its business mix, Berkshire's business segments are largely cyclical. Therefore, we have presented a DCF model adjusting for macroeconomic and cyclical fluctuations in earnings and cash flows for all sectors (insurance, manufacturing, utilities, railroad, etc.) and have built scenarios based upon different macroeconomic environments.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

{: .note }

Recent concerns around Berkshire include the company's large cash holdings and succession planning.  In the 2022 shareholder letter, Buffett reiterated his confidence in Berkshire's management team and his long-term approach to investing.

> We continue to make more mistakes when we're getting greedy than when we're getting fearful - 1997 

> “If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes” - 1996


**Upcoming Catalysts**

> “If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need”

Potential catalysts for Berkshire's share price include:

* **Market Correction:**  A significant market downturn could create opportunities for Berkshire to acquire high-quality businesses at attractive prices. This is because Berkshire Hathaway prioritizes intrinsic value over market price, and seeks opportunities of companies and businesses that are trading for cheaper than their actual worth.
* **Increased Profitability at Subsidiaries:** Continued growth and improved profitability at key subsidiaries like BNSF Railway and Berkshire Hathaway Energy could drive earnings growth.
* **Share Repurchases:** If Berkshire's shares trade at a significant discount to intrinsic value, increased share repurchases would be accretive to shareholders.
* **Succession Plan:** A clear and well-communicated succession plan would reduce uncertainty and potentially boost investor confidence. As Fisher discusses in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*, investor confidence in the long-term future of a company is a significant positive factor for choosing that firm. However, as Buffett says,  “The investor of today must take a longer view than the investor of a few decades ago”.
