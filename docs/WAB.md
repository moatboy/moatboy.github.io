{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

{: .note }
Wabtec operates in a niche market with high barriers to entry, primarily due to the specialized knowledge and significant capital investments required.  Regulation also plays a role in creating and protecting this niche.  However, the moat is not exceptionally wide.  The increasing industry consolidation could lead to increased competition and pricing pressure in the long run. While Wabtec benefits from switching costs associated with its products, these are not as powerful as switching costs in some software businesses.  Additionally, technological innovation, while important to Wabtec's business, could also disrupt its existing product lines if competitors are quicker to adopt new technologies.

**Management (3/5):**

{: .warning }
Management receives a middling rating. While they have overseen substantial growth through acquisitions (and have continued the strategy), organic growth has been less impressive. The company's overreliance on acquisitions for growth suggests an unwillingness to improve current operations and cost controls for long-term organic value creation. Its debt load raises some concern regarding financial discipline and maneuverability. The 2020 over-time revenue recognition scandal, while settled, casts a shadow over accounting practices. While management boasts strong insider ownership, their communication is less than forthcoming, and capital allocation decisions (specifically the GE Transportation acquisition) appear questionable.

**Management Justification:**

{: .important }
* **History:**  A long history, but with a recent accounting scandal that raises concerns about transparency. (Source: 2020 10-K)
* **Experience:**  Experience through acquisitions but less impressive organic growth raises concerns about true managerial expertise.
* **Compensation:**  Compensation is tied to company performance but without detail on the exact metrics used.  
* **Insider Ownership:**  Relatively high insider ownership, which is a positive sign. (Source: 2020 Proxy)
* **Communication:**  A reluctance to give full and frank disclosures is not consistent with optimal manager-shareholder communications. 
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** The GE Transportation acquisition has raised concerns about value creation and integration. (Source: Multiple Earnings Calls)

**Catalyst (2/5):**

{: .note }
Potential catalysts for Wabtec include a rebound in freight rail traffic and increased investment in rail infrastructure globally, as well as new product introductions. However, these catalysts are dependent on broader macroeconomic trends and competitive pressures, making them less certain.

**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:**  Wabtec derives its revenues primarily from freight rail products and services, with a smaller but growing portion coming from passenger transit.  The company operates globally, but its biggest market is North America. (Source: 2020 10-K)
* **Industry Trends:**  The freight rail industry is consolidating, and there is a growing emphasis on efficiency and technological improvement.
* **Margins:**  Margins have been reasonably stable but could be under pressure if competition increases.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Wabtec faces competition from other established players as well as from new entrants. The biggest competitive advantage is often related to scale, switching costs and service.
* **What Makes Wabtec Different:** Wabtec's size, global reach, and comprehensive product portfolio give it some competitive advantages.

**Financials:**

Wabtec's financials have been heavily influenced by acquisitions, making organic growth difficult to assess.  While margins have been relatively stable, the debt-to-equity ratio has increased significantly in recent years, particularly after the acquisition of GE Transportation.  (Source: 2020 10-K and subsequent filings)

**Valuation ($12.6 Billion):**

A three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used to value Wabtec. The model divides future cash flows into two categories: the cash flows during the explicit forecast period and cash flows during the continuing-value period.

{: .highlight }

**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Explicit forecast period (10 years):**
    * Revenue growth: 5% for the first five years and 3% thereafter (based on historical growth rates and current market projections; being moderately pessimistic).
    * Operating Margin: Gradually increasing to a normalized level of 18% (based on historical margins and competitive benchmarks; being pessimistic).
    * Sales-to-capital ratio: 0.7 (based on historical data; assuming no significant changes).
    * Tax rate: 25% (WAB's effective tax rate, assuming no significant changes).
* **Continuing-value period:**
    * Growth rate: 3% (long-term growth rate of the economy; taking the low end of estimates).
    * Return on invested capital (ROIC): 14% (below the company's cost of capital, assuming competitive pressures in the long run).
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**
    * Risk-free rate: 4.5% (based on the 10-Year US Treasury bond).
    * Market risk premium: 5.5% (historical average market risk premium, discounted for future lower average returns).
    * Beta: 1.1 (unlevered and then relevered based on a target capital structure with 25% debt and 75% equity). 
    * Cost of debt: 6.5% (based on bond ratings and historical spreads).
    * Marginal tax rate: 25% (WAB's effective tax rate).

{: .important }

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  FCF was projected for each year of the explicit forecast period based on the assumptions above.
2. **Continuing Value:**  The continuing value was estimated using the perpetuity growth model, discounted back to the end of the explicit forecast period.
3. **Present Value of FCF:** The present value of the projected FCFs and continuing value was computed using the WACC.
4. **Nonoperating Assets:** Nonoperating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities were valued separately.
5. **Enterprise Value:** The present value of the operating assets and the value of the non-operating assets were summed to arrive at the enterprise value.
6. **Equity Value:** The value of debt and other non-equity claims were subtracted from enterprise value to arrive at the equity value.
7. **Value per Share:**  Equity value was divided by the diluted number of shares outstanding to arrive at the value per share.


The resulting value per share from the DCF model is substantially below the current market price. This is consistent with a pessimistic view of Wabtec's long-term growth potential and its ability to manage debt and generate returns in the face of increasing industry consolidation. 

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Over-Time Revenue Recognition:**  Wabtec settled a lawsuit alleging accounting fraud related to over-time revenue recognition, raising questions about accounting practices. (Source: 2020 10-K).  This scandal created some damage to management credibility among investors and stakeholders (although it is not clear how widespread the distrust is).  This will be tracked carefully going forward.
* **GE Transportation Acquisition:**  The integration of GE Transportation has been challenging, impacting margins and creating operational issues.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Freight Rail Rebound:**  An increase in freight rail traffic could boost Wabtec's revenues and earnings.
* **Infrastructure Investment:**  Government investment in rail infrastructure could create new opportunities for Wabtec.
* **New Product Introductions:**  Successful new product introductions could drive growth and improve margins.

These potential catalysts are dependent on broader economic conditions and competitive pressures, and may be difficult to accurately project.
