Pessimistic value: $172 B

Netflix operates in a dynamic and competitive industry. While it has built a sizable brand and a large subscriber base, its moat is not as formidable as some other companies with stronger competitive advantages. Its main source of competitive advantage is the network effect, but this is under pressure due to intensifying competition, rising costs, and changing consumer behavior.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Moat (3/5):**

Netflix's network effect stems from its large subscriber base.  More subscribers attract more content creators, leading to better content, which attracts more subscribers. This virtuous cycle has helped Netflix establish a dominant position in the streaming video industry. However, this moat is not insurmountable. As discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, network effects are strongest in closed networks. Unlike stock exchanges or payment networks, the streaming market is open, and switching costs—though increasing with the increasing prevalence of personalized recommendations—are relatively low compared to, for example, enterprise software or medical devices.  

{: .warning }

Competition has intensified with the entry of well-funded players like Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video. These competitors have deep content libraries and are aggressively investing in new content.  This increased competition has put pressure on Netflix's pricing power and profitability. As discussed in Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan's *Measuring the Moat*, sustainable value creation requires ROIC > WACC (weighted average cost of capital). Netflix's ROIC has been declining, though it is still above its cost of capital. Further intensifying competition may increase pressure and possibly decrease subscriber counts in the near term.

**Management (3/5):**

Netflix's management team has a mixed record.  On the positive side, they were early movers in the streaming video space and built a sizable business with global reach.  They have also demonstrated an ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences, as demonstrated by their shift from DVDs to streaming and their increasing investment in original content.

{: .important }

However, there are also concerns.  Capital allocation decisions have been questionable at times, with investments in some areas outside their core competency (e.g., video games, mobile) yielding mediocre returns.  Their compensation structure, with substantial stock options grants, may incentivize short-term focus at the expense of long-term value creation, as discussed in Warren Buffett's *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*. Insider ownership is relatively high, but management communication has been inconsistent and at times overoptimistic about future growth prospects (e.g., original content spending, international expansion).  Specifically, in recent earnings calls, management has indicated a willingness to continue to compete for streaming dominance by pricing competitively, adding content, and increasing access via more mobile devices. However, competition is increasing in the face of stagnating revenue growth, which increases financial pressure on the company. Consequently, their stance seems overly aggressive.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for Netflix include continued subscriber growth in international markets, successful expansion into new areas like video games and live sports, and the development of new revenue streams through advertising or cloud gaming.  However, the strength and timing of these catalysts are uncertain, and competition is likely to remain intense. The recent password crackdown has increased subscriber numbers but has not translated into increased revenue, as they trade more revenue growth for maintaining prices at the existing level.  Overall, the company will have to rely on existing levers of subscriber acquisition, with little room for expansion.

**Business:**

Netflix operates a subscription-based streaming video service. Its revenues are primarily from subscriptions, with a small but growing contribution from advertising. The company is expanding internationally, but growth has slowed in recent years.  Margins have been under pressure due to increasing content costs and competition.  Netflix differentiates itself through original content, user interface, and recommendation algorithms. The company operates in nearly all countries worldwide, but revenues are concentrated in the UCAN and EMEA regions.

**Financials:**

Netflix's financials reflect the challenges it faces. Revenue growth has slowed, while operating expenses have increased, leading to margin compression.  Free cash flow has improved recently, but the company's financial leverage is high.  

{: .note }

A detailed examination of Netflix's financial statements is necessary to understand the drivers of cash flow and value. The financials presented in this valuation are from the SEC 10-K filings for fiscal years 2020, 2021, and 2022.  As highlighted in Aswath Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, it is important to distinguish between equity valuation and firm valuation when applying discounted cash flow analysis. We will value the entire firm and then subtract out the value of non-equity claims to arrive at equity value.

**Valuation ($172 Billion):**

This valuation uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. It is based on conservative assumptions about future growth and profitability, and incorporates a discount for the high uncertainty surrounding Netflix's future prospects.  The valuation uses a three-stage model, with higher growth in the early years, followed by slower growth and eventually reaching a terminal growth rate. Specifically, I assumed a decline in revenue growth rate from 25.80% in 2021 to 14.74% in 2022, and estimate a growth rate of 10% for the next three years and decrease to 6% from year 6 to 10,  and an 8% cost of equity (based on 3.80% Risk Free rate, 4.2% ERP, and 1.11 beta), to account for intense competition and market risk. The terminal growth rate is assumed to be 3% and the reinvestment rate is 20%.

| 5          | 10%              | $50,918m   | 20%         | $10,184m   |
| 6          | 6%              | $53,955m   | 20%         | $10,791m   |
| 7          | 6%              | $57,253m   | 20%         | $11,451m   |
| 8          | 6%              | $60,778m   | 20%         | $12,156m   |
| 9          | 6%              | $64,556m   | 20%         | $12,911m   |
| 10         | 6%              | $68,561m   | 20%         | $13,712m   |
| Terminal  | 3%             |           |                 |             |



Terminal Value = (EBIT *(1-t)*(1-Reinvestment rate))/ (Cost of Capital - Growth Rate)

= ($13,712m * (1-0.2) * (1-0.2))/(0.08-0.03)

= $175,533m

{: .note }

The reinvestment rate is assumed to be 20%, based on the average capital expenditures divided by the average after-tax operating income, across the years covered in this valuation.  Specifically, I used $5,213 million for capital expenditures and $26,066m for operating income (after-tax). As discussed in the *Little Book of Valuation*, the reinvestment rate reflects management's capital allocation decisions (it is not unusual for a firm with new management to make sizable changes in existing capital allocation policies).

{: .important }

Based on these numbers, the DCF valuation of operations of Netflix is $149.7 billion, which after deducting outstanding debt of $14.6 billion (from the company's balance sheet), and cash of $6.6 billion from the most recent 10-K, yields a value of $132.5 billion. Given the fact that the industry is continuing to consolidate, with the possibility of some consolidation related to Netflix, I added $40 billion to my DCF valuation to account for the likelihood of a future takeover premium. The resulting firm value is $172.5 billion, which, divided by the number of shares outstanding at $23.73 billion, gives a value of $428.81 per share.
