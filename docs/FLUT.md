>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Flutter benefits from some sources of competitive advantage, though their durability and strength are moderate at best.

* **Brand:** Flutter owns several well-known brands, including FanDuel, Paddy Power, Betfair, and PokerStars. These brands hold some value, though predominantly in established markets where brand recognition exists. However, a well-known brand in and of itself does not necessarily translate into pricing power.  As Pat Dorsey writes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brands only create a moat if they increase a customer's willingness to pay.  In online gambling, brand loyalty can be fickle and customer acquisition costs are high, limiting the long-term value creation potential of brands in this industry.  
* **Scale:** As Dorsey points out, "bigger is not necessarily better" when it comes to moats. While Flutter benefits from scale in certain areas like marketing and negotiations with sports leagues, the online nature of its business makes it easier for new entrants to scale up and gain sufficient size to become meaningful competitors. In the Q3 2020 earnings call, the management discussed the increasing competition from smaller operators in the US market, acknowledging the relatively low barriers to entry. In several markets, Flutter also competes against government-sponsored entities that have almost limitless resources, such as lottery providers.

{: .warning }

The online nature of Flutter's business, combined with generally low customer switching costs, makes it more susceptible to disruption than asset-heavy businesses with high switching costs.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Flutter's management has been acquisitive, purchasing several companies over the past few years. While some of these acquisitions have expanded the company's market share and geographic reach, the long-term value creation from these acquisitions remains to be seen. The substantial goodwill on Flutter's balance sheet reflects the premium paid for these acquisitions. As Aswath Damodaran emphasizes in *Valuation*, acquisitions typically destroy value for the acquirer, and a careful analysis must be performed to ensure that synergies are realistic and achievable.

* **Communication:** Flutter's management provides some segment data and discusses market trends, which is positive. However, more transparency concerning the profitability of individual product lines and geographic segments would be beneficial. In the Q3 2020 earnings call, the management discussed plans for increased investment in the US market, but more granular information on how the management plans to compete in that competitive landscape would be valuable.

* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Information on executive compensation and insider ownership wasn't available in the provided resources, making it difficult to evaluate management's incentives and alignment with shareholder interests.

{: .important }

The recent acquisition of Sisal and the ongoing fantasy sports investigation raise concerns about the management's judgment. Aswath Damodaran emphasizes in *The Little Book of Valuation* that past performance is not a reliable predictor of the future.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **US Market Expansion:** The US online gambling market is growing rapidly, presenting a potentially significant opportunity for Flutter.  However, this market is also becoming increasingly competitive, with many established players, along with new entrants with substantial resources. The outcome of the fantasy sports investigation could also have a major impact on FanDuel's future growth.

{: .note }

Flutter's ability to execute in this challenging market, while managing regulatory hurdles, will determine whether it can successfully leverage this potential catalyst.  The low rating reflects the uncertainty and risk associated with this catalyst.

**Valuation (€14.6 Billion):**

I performed a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using the following assumptions and procedures:

1. **Explicit Forecast Period:** 10 years, after which a simplified model assuming stable growth was employed.
2. **Revenue Growth:** Based on the Q4 2022 earnings call, Flutter expects low-single-digit revenue growth in the US.  For the explicit forecast period, I assumed 2% revenue CAGR (compounded annual growth rate), which increases gradually from years 1 through 5, and then decreases gradually from years 6 through 10, based on a revenue growth transition probability matrix generated from historical data on US-based, nonfinancial companies over the past 45 years.
3. **Operating Margin:** Flutter's adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 was 14.7%, while that of its closest US peers (DKNG, PENN, CZR) was 22%. For the explicit forecast, I assumed 22% operating margin, which increases gradually over the 10-year period based on operating margin increases achieved at comparable US-based companies.  
4. **Reinvestment Rate:** I assumed a reinvestment rate of 10% of operating income to reflect capital expenditures and working capital needs to support 2% revenue growth.
5. **Tax Rate:** I used Flutter's effective tax rate of 20% in 2022.
6. **Cost of Equity:** I used the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to estimate the cost of equity. The risk-free rate was estimated at 3.3% based on the yield-to-maturity of 10-year Irish Government Bonds in May 2023. The equity market risk premium was set at 4.5%, based on the historical average of market returns over government bond returns in developed markets. The levered beta was 1.12 based on the median of the unleveled betas for a sample of global peers. This resulted in a cost of equity of 8.36%.  
7. **Cost of Debt:** Based on Flutter's bond rating of BBB+ and a default spread of 1.89%, I estimated its cost of debt at 5.25%.
8. **WACC:**  Based on its target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity, and the above cost of equity and cost of debt, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was 7.6%.
9. **Terminal Growth:** I assumed a long-term growth rate of 3% in perpetuity and a terminal year return on capital of 12%. This gives a present value of $49.3 billion, which is discounted back to today's dollars using the cumulative discounted WACC to arrive at a terminal value.  This terminal value is added to the present values of the cash flows from the explicit forecast period and the value of nonoperating assets to arrive at an intrinsic value for the company.
10. **Probability of Failure:** Given that Flutter operates in a risky business, with substantial debt, in a volatile economy, I assigned a 5% probability of failure to capture its riskiness.


{: .highlight }

Given all of the above assumptions, the computed equity value for Flutter is $67 billion. After accounting for all other equity claims and dividing by the number of shares outstanding at the time of writing, the valuation yields an equity value per share of approximately €245, for an enterprise value of €14.6 Billion.  (Note: this valuation is based on Flutter's market capitalization on July 31, 2023).


**Business Overview:**

Flutter's revenue primarily comes from sports betting and gaming across multiple brands and geographies. A significant portion of its revenue now comes from the US market, where it holds a leading position.  The industry is growing rapidly, especially in emerging markets. Margins vary considerably across segments, with the US market currently posting losses due to high customer acquisition costs. Competition is intense, and industry consolidation is underway.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Fantasy Sports Investigation:** A significant overhang on Flutter is the ongoing investigation into FanDuel's fantasy sports business practices. The outcome of this investigation could negatively impact the growth and profitability of the business. In the Q1 2023 earnings call, the management acknowledged the investigation and stated that it was cooperating fully with authorities, but declined to provide further commentary.

* **Increased Competition:**  The US market is becoming increasingly competitive, and Flutter needs to prove its ability to acquire and retain customers cost-effectively while managing regulatory hurdles. This risk is exacerbated by the large cash balances being accumulated by DraftKings and other private companies in the industry.

**Additional Information:**

* **Valuation Model:** The DCF model assumes stable growth, consistent margins, and a constant cost of capital and tax rate beyond year 10.  These are simplifications for illustration purposes, and the actual dynamics of the business are likely to be much more complex.  I recommend using scenario analysis to assess the impact of varying assumptions on valuation.  You should feel encouraged to use your own judgement and information to adjust my model.

* **Management Team:** Management quality is a crucial factor in this industry.  While the current management team has demonstrated revenue growth, they need to show their ability to manage the business efficiently and generate profits on a sustainable basis.  The ongoing investigation adds a layer of uncertainty about their judgment.

* **Regulatory Risk:**  The gambling industry is heavily regulated, which can affect company performance.  Changes in regulations or taxation could negatively impact future growth and profitability.
