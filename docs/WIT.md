{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Wipro's moat stems primarily from two sources:

1. **Switching Costs:**  Similar to what is discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, there are some switching costs associated with changing IT service providers.  Businesses generally prefer to stick with existing IT service relationships rather than having to learn a new system. However, these switching costs are not high. In a world of cloud-based and highly standardized IT services, the transition from one provider to another has become progressively easier and less costly, especially given the standardization that is often present. The modular nature of IT services further diminishes these costs.
2. **Brand Name:** A company with a strong brand name often benefits, from customers being more willing to pay a premium. Wipro has brand name recognition, which can contribute somewhat to its moat.  However, as Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan from Morgan Stanley wrote in their *Measuring the Moat* report, a well-known brand is not automatically a moat. The popularity of the brand matters much less than whether it actually affects consumer behavior. While Wipro is a well-known name, particularly in India,  it faces strong competition from other large IT service providers, suggesting that its brand doesn't translate into pricing power as seen with stronger, wider-moat consumer branded companies.

**Management (3/5):**

Wipro's management receives a middling rating due to a combination of factors:

* **History and Experience:** Wipro has a long history, having been founded in 1945.  However, its recent financial performance has been uneven. In fact, in the year ending March 31, 2021, Wipro reported its lowest operating margin since 2008. In the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, Wipro's revenue and profits were significantly boosted by the post-COVID economic recovery. Nevertheless, the recovery from its low operating margin in 2021 raises questions about management's ability to consistently generate strong financial performance.  Therefore, we lower their rating.
* **Communication:** Wipro provides regular updates through earnings calls and filings, but these updates sometimes give a "rosier" view than warranted by their actual performance.  For example, their treatment of acquisitions is often obfuscating (as seen in the Q4 2022 call). Similarly, their announcements regarding share repurchases and buybacks often seem designed more to enhance short-term earnings than to benefit shareholders in the long run, as seen in how they manage earnings to make EPS look good every quarter. This opacity diminishes management's credibility and therefore, we lower their rating.
* **Capital Allocation:** While Wipro has generated cash, it has not consistently reinvested it effectively or delivered it as dividends.  As discussed in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company, acquisitions are rarely value-creating. Wipro has made several acquisitions in recent years and it is unclear what value they will create. Wipro has also engaged in share buybacks, which can enhance share price, but these buybacks often seem poorly timed and motivated more by accounting engineering rather than by undervaluation, thereby not benefiting shareholders.
* **Compensation:** In many emerging markets, executive compensation can be a contentious issue.  Wipro has not faced criticism on this subject, so we consider this neutral.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is low, with the promoters holding a small percentage of the company.  A larger stake from management would align their interests more directly with shareholders, which might add to their rating slightly but since it is already small, this isn't much of a help.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Wipro's primary potential catalysts are:

1. **Turnaround in IT Services Growth:**  The global IT services market is expected to grow steadily over the coming years. If Wipro can gain market share and improve its margins, its share price could rise significantly, like Michael Burry did by buying shares in the early 2000s. Wipro has a newly appointed CEO, who seems determined to lead the company back to its former glory, as suggested by its new CEO’s appointment in 2021.  However, it remains to be seen whether this new management can deliver on its promise, or whether the stock market will recognize the true significance of such a change and hence will not bring any immediate effect. This is why we lower the rating.
2. **Success in Emerging Markets:**  Wipro generates a significant portion of its revenues from emerging markets like India, and it expects these markets to be an important engine of growth in future years.  If Wipro can capitalize on the growth opportunities presented by these markets—which we consider to be likely given Wipro's past history of success in these high-growth markets—its share price could respond positively. This might be a slow burner over the next few years, given the competitive landscape of emerging markets and the slow growth rates typically seen in the early stages of industry consolidation.

**Valuation ($24.08 billion):**

To value Wipro, we use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, employing a business-as-usual scenario with a five-year explicit forecast period.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a revenue growth of 3 percent annually over the coming decade, with revenue growth rate declining significantly until year 5, which then stabilizes by year 10. This is consistent with the historical revenue growth rate for established IT services companies in maturing markets.
* **Operating Margin:** We forecast an operating margin of 15 percent in the medium term, which is above Wipro's historical average, but substantially below the industry average. This is a pessimistic estimate reflecting the competitive landscape, and as we recall, what is mentioned in the *Intelligent Investor*, it is better to have more margin of safety and the company does not have a good position in its core business.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.6 percent, with an industry beta of 0.7, a risk-free rate of 4 percent, a market risk premium of 4.5 percent, and a cost of debt of 4 percent. Given that the Indian market is in its growth stage, with relatively high interest rate and required returns, and as we saw in the financial crisis of 2008, the higher volatility relative to developed markets justifies this cost of capital. However, this is also dependent on the debt ratio and the associated tax rate.

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Financial Statements:** We project Wipro's income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for the next 10 years, using the preceding assumptions. In this valuation, we are using a simplified approach and using yearly financials, without making any quarterly adjustments or estimations. All financial projections are built at the level of the company as a whole.
2. **Terminal Value:** We estimate Wipro's terminal value using the perpetuity growth model, assuming a perpetual growth rate of 3 percent and the previously estimated cost of capital. Specifically, we value the company at the end of year 10.
3. **Present Value:** We discount the projected cash flows and the terminal value back to the present, using the estimated WACC.
4. **Value of Equity:** We subtract net debt and any other claims from enterprise value.  We assume these are negligible for Wipro.
5. **Value per Share:** We divide the value of equity by the number of shares outstanding.

**Results:**

The resulting valuation is **$24.08 billion**, well below the current market cap ($35B). This is primarily because I'm pessimistic about Wipro's revenue growth and operating margins in light of its weak moat.


**Recent Concerns:**

Wipro's latest earnings calls mention a challenging macro environment and pricing pressure, particularly in mature markets. The company aims to mitigate these headwinds by focusing on digital transformation, cloud services, and cost optimization for clients, as well as expanding into emerging markets. In its Q4 2022 call, management also highlighted the company’s plans to increase investments in R&D and talent.  This emphasis on improving R&D and talent is crucial for their future, as mentioned in the "Financial crisis 2007/2008" section of McKinsey & Company’s *Valuation*, where they discuss how companies that create value in the longer term tend to have more investment in R&D.


**Additional Information:**

Wipro has a significant presence in India, which can be both a strength and a weakness. The company may benefit from the country's rapid economic growth, like many other large Indian companies, including TCS, as seen in this company’s 20F SEC filling and discussed in Michael Mauboussin's book *More Than You Know*.  However, as highlighted in Aswath Damodaran's lecture, *The Dark Side of Valuation*, country risk is a non-trivial factor that investors usually tend to ignore when doing valuation of companies. Thus, when valuing a firm like Wipro, you should not just determine the magnitude of expected returns but should also factor in country-specific risks.


Remember, valuations are just tools, and all valuations are biased as mentioned in Aswath Damodaran's lecture *The Dark Side of Valuation*.  It's crucial to understand the underlying business and its competitive landscape.  Given Wipro's relatively weak moat and the uncertainties surrounding its future performance, its stock may be overvalued even at current prices. Thus, you should apply substantial margin of safety to your analysis.
