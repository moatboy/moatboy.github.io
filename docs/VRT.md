{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

While Vertiv operates in an attractive industry, its moat is narrow.  The company does benefit from some switching costs, as demonstrated by its sticky maintenance revenue from certain customers, along with long-term contracts with significant buyers. However, it does not have significant pricing power, since its main competitors also offer similar solutions. A strong competitor could arise over time that is able to offer better service and products.
Its description as a "license to print money" by Morningstar back in 1995 is no longer applicable and an overstatement. The competitive landscape has evolved, and new entrants, especially in niche markets, are increasing. Morningstar has revised its moat rating accordingly.

**Management Assessment (2/5):**

Vertiv's management's history inspires little confidence. A recent management team shakeup has not yet demonstrated tangible improvements in performance.  The company has experienced material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, their capital allocation decisions have been questionable, with acquisitions failing to deliver the promised synergies and cost savings. These red flags suggest that managers are prioritizing growth over shareholder returns. Executive compensation seems excessive, though there is less insider ownership than I like to see. The quarterly earnings calls have improved, providing more granular insights into business segments. However, it still feels that the management teams talks up a good show but doesn't follow up on their commitments.

**Catalyst Assessment (3/5):**

Vertiv's business could benefit from industry consolidation. Also, the new management team's restructuring initiatives could lead to margin improvements.  A potential catalyst could arise in the form of a takeover by a larger player seeking entry or expansion in the industry.  
However, the company's reliance on debt financing introduces a higher degree of risk, limiting its financial flexibility in pursuing acquisitions or other value-creating initiatives.

**Business Overview:**

Vertiv operates in three business segments: Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe, Middle East & Africa.
{: .new }

*Revenue Distribution (as of 2022 Annual Report)*: Americas 53%, Asia Pacific 24%, EMEA 23%.  
Cloud computing and colocation leasing companies, like Vertiv, serve as critical hubs in the industry ecosystem. Other important players include manufacturers of rack distribution systems, engine and generator manufacturers, power distribution units suppliers, cooling systems vendors, software developers, service providers, data center service providers, government agencies, fiber optics installers, and telecom providers.  Large players like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Meta, Dell, and others increase the competitive dynamics by offering IT infrastructure, cloud products, platforms, storage, analytics, applications and related services.


The company has seen its market share erode in recent years, and margins have been under pressure.

**Financial Analysis and Valuation ($4.5 Billion):**

Vertiv's financials have been volatile, with significant debt and substantial negative free cash flow. For the valuation, I use a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, incorporating conservative growth and margin assumptions and probability weighted scenarios. 

*Key Assumptions*:
{: .important }

* Revenue growth: 3% for the next 5 years, declining to 2% thereafter (aligning with the conservative long-term growth rate of the broader economy). This assumes a very optimistic and best case scenario, without looking at the possibility that the company won't make it.
* Operating Margin: 15% (below its historical peak, but higher than recent levels). This is a very optimistic number that seems too good to be true, given past operating performance and competitive landscape.
* Reinvestment rate: 20% for the next 5 years, gradually declining to 10% (reflecting anticipated reduced investment needs as growth slows).  This suggests a pessimistic view of the company's ability to convert investment into profitable growth.
* Cost of Capital: 12% (includes a risk premium for the industry and the company's financial leverage). Given its debt load, dependence on cyclical investments, and the uncertainty about the future, this number should have been higher.
* Failure probability: 10% in the next 10 years, liquidation value of 25 cents on the dollar.
{: .note }

The above is being said after having read The Little Book of Valuation. Aswath Damodaran teaches us about the importance of a distress sale value. He also tells us how to compute the annual default rates given cumulative probabilities. He shows that there can be significant difference in a valuation, from the sunny view and the not-so-sunny view.


*Valuation Process*:
{: .highlight }

1. *Project free cash flow (FCF) for the next 10 years*: Based on the preceding assumptions, FCF is projected to remain negative for the next 4 years and then turn positive but remain anemic.
2. *Estimate terminal value*:  Using a perpetual growth model, the terminal value at year 10 is estimated to be approximately $2.5 billion (assuming continued anemic growth).
3. *Discount cash flows and terminal value*: Discounting the projected cash flows and the terminal value back to today at a 12% cost of capital yields an enterprise value of about $4.5 billion.
4. *Adjust for non-operating assets and liabilities:* As of 3/31/2023, non-operating assets consist primarily of cash, which totals 261 million, and non-operating liabilities consist primarily of long-term debt, which totals $3,530 million. Subtracting the debt and adding the cash yields an equity value of around $1 Billion.
5. *Convert to per share value:*  Dividing by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding yields an intrinsic value per share of roughly $5.50. 

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Vertiv has faced scrutiny for its high debt levels and inconsistent profitability.  The management team's capital allocation track record is concerning, with acquisitions failing to deliver promised cost savings and revenue growth.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* *Restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives*: The new management team has announced a restructuring plan aimed at improving margins and profitability.  Success in executing this plan could improve investor confidence and potentially lead to higher valuations.
* *Industry consolidation*: The data center infrastructure market is fragmented, with the potential for further consolidation. Vertiv could be a target for acquisition by a larger player or could benefit from acquiring smaller competitors. This will give it more exposure in the market.
* *Improved demand environment*: Increased demand for data center capacity could drive higher revenues and profits for Vertiv.


These are the factors that are being taken into account for its catalyst rating.

**Overall Investment Thesis:**

Vertiv operates in a growing market with strong secular tailwinds. However, its narrow moat, high debt load, and inconsistent financial performance under its current management warrant a cautious and pessimistic view. While the intrinsic value suggests potential upside from current trading levels, it's crucial to acknowledge the substantial risks involved. A more compelling investment case would emerge with demonstrated improvement in the company's financial health and operating performance under the new management team and with the successful implementation of the restructuring plan. Until then, I remain cautious, as I am pessimistic and skeptical about their future.
