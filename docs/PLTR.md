{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Moat (2/5):**

Palantir's potential moat stems from high switching costs (once its software is integrated, it's difficult and expensive to switch) and network effects (as more users join the platform, the more valuable it becomes).  However, these are still developing.  Switching costs are high for existing clients, but new clients may be hesitant given the controversy surrounding the company's government contracts and questions about its ethical use. Network effects are limited by the software's specialized applications for government and large enterprises, hindering broad-based adoption.  Furthermore, competition in the data analytics space is intensifying, with well-funded companies like Microsoft and Amazon offering competing services. Thus, assigning it a narrow moat rating of 2 makes sense given the current competitive landscape and Palantir's specialized solutions.


**Management (2/5):**

> _From "Mistaken Moats" in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth":  Talented CEOs are … a rather common thing, the few studies that have been done to try to isolate the effect of managerial decisions show that management’s impact on corporate performance is not that large._

While Palantir's founders and leadership team are highly regarded for their technical expertise and vision, their performance as managers of a publicly traded company warrants skepticism. The company has a history of aggressive financial engineering and sometimes overly optimistic projections. There are concerns about capital allocation, as evidenced by acquisitions of companies in diverse sectors with unclear synergies (as Micheal Burry warned against) and large stock-based compensation packages, disproportionately awarded to executives, which dilutes shareholder value. Palantir's communication with investors has also been criticized for lacking transparency, with aggressive use of non-GAAP metrics. While the company states its commitment to shareholders' long-term interests, it primarily allocates cash to acquisitions and stock buybacks rather than dividends, with little focus on returning cash to shareholders. Its CEO, Alex Karp, while undoubtedly brilliant, often focuses on high-level philosophical discussions in earnings calls rather than providing details on financial and operational aspects of the company. This is evident from its earnings calls, for example, the Q2 2023 earnings call, where a significant portion of the opening remarks focused on macroeconomics and geopolitics rather than company performance. These concerns justify a below-average rating of 2 for management.

> _From "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits":  The degree of management turnover … is an almost infallible assurance that what Banks are saying is correct._

Insider ownership at Palantir is fairly low for a young, growing tech firm, further justifying a more cautious assessment of management.


**Catalyst (3/5):**

Palantir's potential catalysts include continued growth in government and commercial business, successful expansion into new sectors, particularly in emerging markets, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) offerings and their integration with core products, strategic acquisitions or divestitures, and improved profitability.


**Valuation ($12.53 Billion):**

> _From "The Dark Side of Valuation": Valuing stable, money-making companies with consistent accounting is easy. The true test of your valuation skills is when you have to value "difficult" companies._

Palantir is a "difficult" company to value, being a young, unprofitable growth company, which makes the process of generating plausible earnings forecast even more challenging. We employed a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with a 10-year explicit forecast horizon.  Given the uncertainty surrounding the company's future, we used a scenario approach with a business-as-usual and a downside scenario. 

**Key Assumptions (Business-as-Usual):**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assumed revenue growth of 8% for the next five years (down from the company's recent growth rate of around 20% and in-line with analysts' current expectations), before tapering down to a terminal growth rate of 3% in line with global GDP.
* **Target Operating Margin:** We assumed a target operating margin of 25% based on management's goals and the industry average for software companies, which is a rather optimistic expectation.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We used a bottom-up approach based on the relationship between revenue growth, reinvestment, and return on invested capital (ROIC). We assume an ROIC of 12%, and a reinvestment rate decreasing from 40% to 10% over 10 years.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9%, derived from a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5.5%, and a beta of 1.25 (levered and unadjusted) along with the company's marginal tax rate.

**Downside Scenario:**

We adjusted the key assumptions downward reflecting macroeconomic uncertainty (slower economic growth, pricing pressure in the software industry, etc.):

* **Revenue Growth:** 4% for the next five years and a terminal rate of 2%.
* **Target Operating Margin:** 20%.


We assigned a 60% probability to the base case and 40% to the downside scenario and discounted the cash flows at the cost of capital.

**Key Valuation Outputs:**

* **Value of Operating Assets:** $29,567 million (business-as-usual) and $15,389 million (downside).
* **Probability-Weighted Value:** ($29,567 x 0.6) + ($15,389 x 0.4) = $23,873 million
* **Value of the Firm:** $23,873 million
* **Less Value of Debt:** We assumed PLTR has negligible debt at this time
* **Value of Equity:** $23,873 million
* **Value per Share:** $23,873 million / 671 million shares outstanding = $35.58

> From the company's Q4 2022 earnings call: Alex Karp stated, _"... The second half of this decade should provide substantially better prospects for the industry as well as for our company."_


**Additional Notes:**

* **Optionality:**  Similar to Amazon in the late 1990s, Palantir's business model potentially offers significant optionality.  Its current core business could be a springboard for expansion into related areas and leveraging its AI capabilities could be quite valuable in the future.  However, like many "difficult" to value companies, as discussed in "The Dark Side of Valuation",  it is challenging to quantify this potential. 

* **Controversies:** As brought up by the company in their Q1 2023 earnings call, Palantir's government contracts are a source of both competitive advantage and controversy. Its work with government agencies provides valuable experience and a client base with high switching costs. However, ethical concerns surrounding data privacy and potential misuse of technology in government surveillance can negatively impact its brand image and limit adoption in certain markets.


* **AI Integration:** The integration of Foundry with large language models (LLMs) appears to be one of the significant upcoming catalysts for the company, enhancing its platforms with new AI-driven applications. However, LLMs have their own issues, as highlighted by the company in their Q2 2023 earnings call, regarding reliability for deployment in enterprise. It's too early to tell whether these LLM efforts will eventually be profitable, but the progress appears promising. Further justification for this assessment can be obtained from their recent announcements regarding collaborations with Jacobs, and the US Army on large language models. Overall, these AI efforts give PLTR a catalyst rating of 3/5.
