{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

ZBH has a *narrow moat*.  While they are a leading player in the musculoskeletal market, the barriers to entry are not insurmountable.  The industry is characterized by a mix of large multinational competitors (e.g., Stryker, Johnson & Johnson) and smaller, more niche players.

* **Intangible Assets:** ZBH has built a strong brand reputation over the years, which contributes to some customer loyalty and pricing power, particularly with surgeons who have established preferences.  However, this brand strength is not as powerful as in other consumer industries (e.g., beverages) due to the specialized nature of the product and the significant influence of hospitals and other institutional buyers.  Furthermore, patents on many products have either expired or are not strong enough to deter competitors for long.
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs for surgeons are somewhat present, as they may develop preferences for specific implants and surgical techniques. However, these are not as significant as the switching costs present in, for example, enterprise software. Surgeons are ultimately driven by patient outcomes and will switch products if a competitor offers a better solution.  This is reinforced by the CEO of Stryker's comment in their 2Q 2023 earnings call: "Surgeons generally do not prefer one vendor over another... So, they try and go to where they get the best technology." This indicates that product innovation and clinical outcomes, rather than brand loyalty, are key drivers in the industry.
* **Cost Advantages:**  ZBH benefits from some economies of scale, but these are not exceptional given the fragmented nature of the industry. The company has manufacturing facilities spread over multiple geographies, which can increase logistic complexity. Furthermore, the trend towards robotic surgery may negate these cost advantages.  As robotic surgical systems are often supplied separately from the implants, it could reduce the importance of scale for implant manufacturers.
* **Network Effect:**  There is no significant network effect present in ZBH's business model.


**Management Assessment (3/5):**

ZBH's management receives a moderate rating.  While they have a long history in the industry and a reasonably experienced team, their capital allocation decisions have been mixed, and their communication could be more transparent.

* **History & Experience:**  The management team possesses a long history in the medical device industry, which should be viewed positively.  However, the company has had a mixed track record.  The CEO and other members of management have been at the helm during periods of both success and struggle.
* **Capital Allocation:** ZBH has made some questionable acquisitions, paying significant premiums for companies that have not yet delivered the promised synergies or growth. For instance, the Biomet acquisition, while expanding ZBH's product portfolio, also saddled the company with substantial debt.
* **Communication:**  Management's communication with investors has not always been sufficiently transparent. This is evidenced by the company's historical reluctance to provide detailed segment data and long-term financial forecasts. This lack of transparency can make it more difficult for investors to assess the company's intrinsic value.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation at ZBH is in line with industry peers.  However, it is heavily weighted towards stock options, which can create short-term incentives and potentially misalign management's interests with those of long-term shareholders.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership at ZBH is relatively low, which can be interpreted as a negative signal, though it's worth noting that the company itself repurchased significant amounts of its own stock between 2014 and 2016.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

ZBH has several potential catalysts for share price appreciation, but none are exceptionally strong or certain.

* **Emerging Markets:**  ZBH has a presence in emerging markets, which are expected to experience faster growth in the long run.  However, these markets also carry greater uncertainty/risk as the CEO noted in the 2Q2023 earnings call: "Emerging markets growth... continue to be fairly volatile."
* **New Products:**  The company continually invests in developing new products and surgical techniques. This is critical to long-term growth but, as discussed in *Valuation*, success in launching new products is uncertain. Furthermore, management does not provide details on R&D pipeline which makes it difficult to fully understand the long-term growth potential.
* **Cost Cutting:**  Management frequently mentions their efforts toward cost-cutting to enhance efficiency.  However, *Valuation* suggests that cost-cutting and increased efficiency are easier said than done. A similar observation is discussed in Dorsey's *The Little Book that Builds Wealth* which mentions how, without a moat, cost-cutting can create a brief bump in earnings, but competitors will follow and compress margins again.
* **Robotic Surgery:** Robotic surgery is transforming the healthcare industry, particularly in orthopedics. ZBH has made strides in this area and there is potential for future growth but substantial uncertainty still remains.

**Valuation ($20.5 Billion):**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate ZBH's intrinsic value.  Given the company's maturity, we will use a two-stage model with a 5-year explicit forecast period followed by a stable growth period.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We forecast revenue growth of 3% annually in the explicit forecast period, slightly below historical levels, reflecting the maturity of the market and the increased competitive pressure. In their 3Q2023 earnings call, management noted that market growth is expected to be "3 to 4%".  We are being a little conservative in our assumption to reflect the possibility of future competition as well as increased pressure from alternative treatment modalities. We assume long-term nominal growth in perpetuity equal to 3%. 
* **Operating Margin:** We expect operating margins to gradually increase during the explicit forecast period. Recent financial statements suggest improving operating profitability. However, as with the revenue growth, we are being a little conservative.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We forecast the reinvestment rate to decline from historical levels as revenue growth slows and the company generates more free cash flow. We assume the reinvestment rate to be 25% in perpetuity. 
* **Cost of Capital:**  We use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 9%, based on ZBH’s capital structure, cost of debt, cost of equity, and tax rate. The cost of equity is estimated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), with a beta of 1.10, in line with the median of its peers, a risk-free rate of 4%, and a market risk premium of 5.5%.

**Calculations:**

{: .note }

We followed the DCF framework presented in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company, using the key value driver formula to derive the continuing value.  We started by projecting operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT), invested capital, free cash flow (FCF), return on invested capital (ROIC) and WACC for years 1 through 5.  The continuing value is then calculated using the continuing-value formula. For further detail, see the example presented in Chapter 6 of Valuation.


The resulting discounted cash flow valuation yields a fair value for the firm of about **$27.6 billion**.  Adjusting for net debt and other non-equity claims results in a fair value of equity of about **$20.5 billion**, or about **$48 per share**.

**Key Financial Data:**

| Metric                    | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    |
|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue ($ millions)       | 7,878   | 8,087   | 7,723   |
| Operating Margin (%)      | 14.7%   | 15.3%   | 15.0%   |
| Net Income ($ millions)  | 884     | 1,010   | 878     |
| Invested Capital ($ millions) | 9,736   | 10,185   | 10,190   |
| ROIC (%)                | 9.1%    | 9.9%    | 8.6%    |

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Declining Revenue:** ZBH has experienced several years of declining or stagnant revenue. The company is under pressure to reignite growth through product introductions and market share gains. 
* **Pricing Pressure:**  The medical device market is becoming increasingly competitive, and ZBH is facing pricing pressure from both large multinational players and smaller, niche competitors, as discussed in the 2Q2023 earnings call.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  Like many other companies, ZBH has faced supply chain challenges in recent years.  This has led to increased costs and delays in product shipments, impacting both profitability and revenue growth.  

**Recent News/Developments:**

* **ZBH's CEO left the company in April 2023.**
* **Actively seeking an acquisition in faster-growing segment** "We are actively looking outside of the large joint space to assess where we can participate in some faster growth categories... It's likely to be businesses that have some sort of overlap in terms of the call points..." (3Q 2023 earnings call).
* **Focus on Emerging Markets and Robotic Surgery:**  ZBH continues to invest in faster-growing geographies and technologies, which could pay off in the long run.  However, as discussed in *Valuation*, there is an inherent risk associated with these markets and technologies.

**Closing Thoughts:**

ZBH’s current market price appears to be modestly overvalued relative to the DCF valuation of **$20.5 billion**, though the current price could be justified if the company can successfully execute on its growth strategy.  However,  investors should approach ZBH with caution, given the competitive landscape and the uncertainty surrounding the medical device industry.
