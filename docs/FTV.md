{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

While Fortive's businesses often operate in niche markets with some pricing power, the overall moat is narrow. This is due to a few key factors:

* **Limited product differentiation:** Many of Fortive's products, while specialized, are not truly unique and face competition from other niche players. This limits the long-term pricing power and sustainability of excess returns. *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* and *Valuation* highlight the importance of strong product differentiation for a wide moat.
* **Technological disruption:** The fast pace of technological change in some of Fortive's end markets (e.g., industrial automation, medical devices) poses a constant threat to the durability of its competitive advantages, as highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.  Fortive's business model must continuously adapt to avoid moat erosion.
* **Acquisition-driven growth:** While acquisitions can be a source of growth, they can also destroy value if not managed carefully.  A substantial portion of Fortive's growth has come from acquisitions, which makes it dependent on the management's ability to identify and integrate synergistic businesses at reasonable prices.  As *Valuation* points out, acquisitions often fail to create value for the acquirer.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

Fortive's management team seems reasonably competent, although their capital allocation decisions and communication could be better.

* **Capital allocation:** Fortive has repurchased shares and made acquisitions, both of which can be ways to return cash to shareholders or invest in growth. However, *Valuation* suggests focusing on reinvestment and organic growth as drivers of long-term value creation, and it's not entirely clear that all of Fortive's capital allocation decisions have been optimal.
* **Communication:**  Fortive provides some segment information in its financial reports, which offers valuable insight into its different businesses. However, more granular information, including margins, capital expenditures, and working capital for each business unit, would make the company more transparent and help investors and analysts better understand the underlying economics of each business, as emphasized in *The Little Book of Valuation*.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is heavily weighted towards stock options, which can incentivize short-term focus and risk-taking, as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Insider Ownership:** While some insider ownership exists, it is not substantial enough to signal a strong alignment of management's interests with those of outside shareholders, as pointed out by *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

There are no immediate major catalysts identified that could significantly boost Fortive's share price.  Continued execution of its strategy and further acquisitions in attractive markets could drive growth, but those are ongoing and not specific upcoming events.

**Business Overview:**

Fortive's businesses operate across a broad range of end markets, including industrial automation, professional instrumentation, transportation technologies, sensing technologies, and franchise distribution.  The competitive landscape varies by business, but Fortive generally operates in niche markets with limited competition.  Margins and revenue growth trends also differ significantly across businesses.

**Financial Analysis and Valuation ($25.58 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model using the following assumptions is used to arrive at an estimated value for Fortive:

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Forecast period:** 10 years (FY2024–FY2033). Justification: A 10-year forecast period allows sufficient time to model reasonably both the short and the medium term, including potential shifts in growth and margins. Beyond 10 years, company financials stabilize, reducing forecast accuracy.
* **Revenue growth:** 3% in perpetuity, starting in FY2024. Justification: We assume that Fortive's overall revenue growth gradually declines from its historical rates to 3% once the markets reach maturity. *Valuation* highlights the tendency for company revenue growth rates to revert toward nominal GDP growth rate in the long run. For the U.S., we use a conservative nominal long-run GDP growth rate of 3%, which includes 1.5% real growth plus 1.5% inflation.
* **Target Operating Margin:** 24% from FY2024 onwards. Justification: For many firms, the assumption that margins will stay stable is a defensible one. 
* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** 1.4 from FY2024 onwards. Justification: The average S/C ratio for Fortive for 2019–2021 was about 1.4.
* **Tax rate:** 21% Justification: This is based on the company's historical effective tax rates.
* **Reinvestment rate:** Varies from 50% to 30% during explicit forecast period, and becomes 40% in perpetuity. Justification: Reinvestment rate will be calculated as [Change in invested capital (net of depreciation) / After tax operating income]. It starts with the premise that a portion of operating profits is not reinvested, instead being paid out to shareholders as dividends. However, as the company grows its business, reinvestment rates are likely to increase over time.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 8.6%. Justification: Based on a target capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity, and a cost of equity of 10.3%. 
     * **Cost of Equity (10.3%):** Risk-free rate (3.8%) + Beta (1.2)*Equity Risk Premium (5.4%) = Cost of Equity. We use the value for beta from the McKinsey report and a conservative Equity Risk Premium of 5.4%, based on historical analysis. We could find more recent data on beta from Bloomberg terminals, but as noted by Michael Burry, regression betas are not very informative, especially in the near term. 
     * **Cost of Debt (4%):** Based on Fortive’s current bond rating of A–.

{: .note }
* For financial modeling, both cash flow and discount rate must be defined using the same tax basis: pretax or after-tax. For the WACC calculation, which is used to discount free cash flows from the entire company, the after-tax cost of debt is used, so the tax shield is not explicitly considered. For the cost of equity calculation, which is used to discount free cash flow to equity, the pretax cost of debt is used, so the tax shield is explicitly considered.
* **Terminal value:** Based on a perpetuity growth model, with a 3% growth rate and an 8.6% WACC. Justification: The terminal value is the value of all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period. The discount rate will be the cost of equity for the first two and the cost of capital for the last, since the three key constraints on the growth rate of the firm in which it operates.

**Valuation Calculation:**

* **Terminal value:**  Using the key-value driver model, continuing value of operations is $27,283 Million.
* **Present value:** Discounting the projected free cash flow and the terminal value at the WACC yields a firm value of $25,578 Million
* **Equity value:** Subtracting the debt ($1,070 Million) from the enterprise value ($25,578 Million) yields an equity value of $24,508 Million.
* **Per share value:** Dividing the equity value by the number of shares outstanding (511 Million) yields a value per share of **$47.94**.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Supply chain disruptions:** In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call, the management discussed supply chain challenges and expressed confidence in its ability to navigate them effectively. 
* **Inflationary pressures:** In the Q2 2022 Earnings Call,  the impact of inflation on the business was highlighted and Fortive's pricing actions discussed.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Further acquisitions:** Successful acquisitions in attractive markets could drive growth.
* **Margin expansion:** Improved operational efficiency could lead to higher margins.
* **Share repurchases:** Share repurchases could increase earnings per share and potentially boost the stock price.
