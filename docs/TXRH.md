### Financial Analysis

{: .note }
Texas Roadhouse’s financials are impressive, but their accounting is not the simplest, having some tricky aspects and adjustments that are important to take into account for accurate evaluation.

*   **Income Statement:**
    *   Revenue growth has been consistent but has been influenced in part by new restaurants, menu prices, and the number of restaurant operating days.
    *   Margins, particularly operating margins, have been under pressure in recent times with higher inflation, as a result net margins have taken a hit.
    *   Labor and raw materials are the largest expenses for the company.
    *   There is a continued increase in impairment on property, equipment, and restaurant closures, which may be a headwind for profits.
    *   The effective tax rates were 13.9% in 2021 and 11.8% in 2022 due to tax incentives.
*   **Balance Sheet:**
    *   The company's cash and cash equivalents are extremely high (at 843.9 million), as they are not making many big acquisitions.
    *   Long-term debt is also very high (around $499 million) with high obligations as a result of their credit agreements.
    *   The company’s equity is quite large (around $1,3 billion)
    *   Goodwill is quite high ($350 million) which should be taken into account.
    *  Capital leases are a big component of their liabilities.
*   **Cash Flow Statement:**
    *   Texas Roadhouse’s operating cash flow is excellent and consistently growing, indicating that it generates more cash than it uses.
    *   Capital expenditures are substantial, as they open a large number of restaurants each year.
    *  There is significant share repurchasing from year to year which is typical for companies in mature industries.

### Moat Analysis (3/5)

*   **Brand Recognition:** Texas Roadhouse has a well-recognized brand, especially in its core steak market. The chain’s combination of quality, hearty portions, and a lively atmosphere has cultivated a loyal customer base. However, it faces competition from other casual dining chains and fast-food competitors. The brand has some strength but not to the level of a “wide moat”.
*   **Location-Based Advantage:** Its chain is largely concentrated in the United States, however it has locations in other countries as well. Also it benefits from local operations that require regional supply chains. It can also be more competitive by having stores closer to their customers.
*   **Cost Advantages**: The company has some ability to control costs, and their business model revolves around providing a lot of value to customers for the price, so if competition increases their margins will go down. The company could be viewed as a low-cost provider for certain regions.
*  **Switching costs:**  There are limited switching costs for dining out options so there is a potential for customers to switch whenever competition increases.
* **Intangibles**: There are limited intangible assets, other than the brand.

### Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience

{: .warning }
The company is heavily affected by increasing costs, and any changes in taste or customer habits are a threat. If any of these effects continue for too long, they could potentially damage the moat or lower its level.

*   **Rising Costs:**
    *   Labor and food costs are significant expenses for Texas Roadhouse, and these costs have been rising in recent times. Any further rise will affect the company’s profits.
    *   Since competitors and others could absorb those costs, this could mean that the company will have to increase prices, diminishing its value proposition.
*   **Intense Competition:**
   * The restaurant industry is incredibly competitive and has low margins. This can mean that Texas Roadhouse needs to fight hard to keep its market share and may lead to decreased earnings.
*  **Consumer Preferences**:
  * Changing tastes or customer preferences can have a big impact on the company. Any shifts in demand for certain types of food can damage their revenues and market share. 
    *  For example the rise of plant-based meats may make their steak-based restaurants more obsolete and irrelevant.
* **Economic Downturn:** The company is susceptible to economic downturns that may impact the discretionary spending of consumers and lead to lower revenues. A recession would probably hurt the companies revenue.
*   **Management:**
    *   While current management is well-respected and experienced, it is always a risk when leadership and management changes.
    *   It is also important to keep a track of company culture, especially for the highly variable human aspect of the restaurant sector.
* **Geopolitical risks**: The company does have some international restaurants and they will be impacted by geopolitical risks such as war and conflict.
