{: .fs-9 }

{: .label .label-purple }

Moat: 3/5

{: .label .label-yellow }

Pessimistic value: $121.2 B

Applied Materials supplies equipment for producing semiconductor chips, display manufacturing, and related industries. It derives the bulk of its revenues, approximately two-thirds, from semiconductor equipment. The remaining revenue streams come from AGS (Applied Global Services), providing consulting and related services, and Display and Adjacent Markets.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution:** As of 2023, roughly 68% of AMAT's revenue comes from Semiconductor Systems, 20% from Applied Global Services, and 12% from Display and Adjacent Markets.
* **Industry Trends:** The semiconductor industry is cyclical and consolidating. Technological advancements, increasing complexity of chips, and rising demand are driving secular growth. The display market is experiencing strong growth driven by demand for screens for TVs, smartphones, and other gadgets.  The AGS business has benefited from growth in installed equipment base.
* **Margins:** AMAT has high gross and operating margins that reflect its strong competitive position. Competition is intense but AMAT has been able to maintain profitability due to scale, switching costs, intangible assets, and some degree of pricing power.
* **Key Business Drivers:** Industry spending patterns (cyclical), technological innovations, global and local economic conditions and regulations (especially in Taiwan, Korea, China), government incentives, access to capital, and skilled human resources.

**Moat Analysis**

AMAT's moat stems from a combination of factors:

1. **Intangible Assets:** AMAT holds a large portfolio of patents, giving it a durable competitive advantage. It has a strong reputation for technological leadership and innovation in the semiconductor and display markets. This translates into brand recognition and pricing power.
2. **Switching Costs:** Its equipment is highly specialized and integrated into customers' manufacturing processes. This creates significant switching costs, as shifting to another supplier requires substantial effort, time, and financial resources. Furthermore, customers depend on AMAT's expertise and service offerings to optimize and maintain its equipment.
3. **Economies of Scale:** The semiconductor and display industries require large capital investments in R&D, manufacturing, and distribution networks. AMAT's global scale and extensive resources give it an advantage over smaller competitors in amortizing these fixed costs over a large revenue base.

> {: .warning }
> Although, AMAT ranks high on all four characteristics of a moat, skepticism is warranted. While intangible assets and switching costs are durable, technological advancements could erode these advantages. The cyclical nature of the industry warrants close monitoring. Moreover, size is a necessary but not sufficient condition for sustainable profitability, and competition for a share of industry profits is likely to increase further. Therefore, AMAT is assigned a Moat Rating of **3 out of 5**, suggesting a narrow moat. This implies that its competitive advantages are likely to last for 10 years, but bear close watching.

**Valuation**

Using an intrinsic valuation approach, we derive a fair value estimate for AMAT.

**Assumptions (Pessimistic)**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Given industry growth forecasts and increased competition, we conservatively project a 10-year revenue CAGR of 3 percent.
* **Target Operating Margin:** Margins are assumed to decline gradually to 25 percent over 10 years to account for increased competition.
* **Sales to Capital Ratio:** AMAT’s average historical sales-to-capital ratio of 1.10.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Estimated at 10.4 percent, higher than AMAT’s past WACC to reflect cyclical uncertainty.
* **Effective Tax Rate:**  Estimated at 25 percent, slightly higher than current, to reflect potential changes in the tax code.

**Calculations**

1. **Forecast Period (10 years):** Revenue, operating income, reinvestment, and free cash flow (FCF) are projected for the next 10 years using the stated assumptions.


2. **Continuing Value:** Using the constant growth perpetuity formula, we discount cash flows at WACC minus sustainable growth rate.

```
CV = [(FCF at end of forecast period) x (1+Stable Growth Rate)] / (Cost of Capital - Stable Growth Rate)
```

CV = $4.4 billion * (1+0.02) / (0.104 - 0.02) = $52.3 billion 


3. **Present Value:** Discount both the yearly projected FCF and the continuing value back to the present using the cost of capital.

```
PV = FCF / (1 + Cost of Capital)^n
```

Value of Operating Assets = Sum of Present Values = $72.2 billion

4. **Fair Value of Equity:** Value of Operating Assets + Cash - Debt = $121.2 billion

> {: .note }
> This valuation incorporates several pessimistic assumptions and omits cash buybacks for the foreseeable future.  It is likely closer to AMAT’s intrinsic value under a bear case.  This is appropriate given the current uncertainties in the semiconductor industry. 

**Conclusion**

AMAT has a narrow moat based on intangible assets, switching costs, and economies of scale.  While the stock has performed well historically, the cyclicality of the industry makes it susceptible to economic downturns. A pessimistic intrinsic valuation suggests a fair value estimate of approximately $121.2 billion for the company.
