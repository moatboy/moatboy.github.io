>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Applied Materials benefits from several sources of competitive advantage that contribute to a narrow moat.

* **Switching Costs:** Once a semiconductor manufacturer integrates AMAT's equipment into its fabrication process, switching to another vendor becomes complex and expensive.  This integration necessitates significant retraining of personnel and retooling of production lines.  This dynamic creates stickiness in customer relationships, akin to the examples of switching costs discussed in Pat Dorsey's "The Little Book that Builds Wealth."  A customer testimonial from the July 2023 earnings call reinforces this notion: "...our new, leading-edge products...are enabling increased productivity for our customers." This implies AMAT's products are not easily replaced, even with new models arriving in the market.
* **Intangible Assets/Technological Advantage:** AMAT possesses significant intellectual property in the form of patents and proprietary processes for creating semiconductor fabrication equipment. This translates into a technological edge, granting them some pricing power, which is a component of competitive advantage as detailed in McKinsey's "Valuation" (5th edition). However, the fast-paced nature of the semiconductor industry, particularly in relation to innovation, suggests that this advantage needs to be constantly defended and reinvented. This is reinforced by the July 2023 quarterly report, which states, "...our new, leading-edge products…are enabling increased productivity for our customers.  This innovative technology is essential to enabling smaller, faster, more powerful, and power-efficient chips." While this is a strength, it also highlights the constant need for innovation.
* **Economies of Scale:** AMAT's size and global presence create cost advantages in sourcing materials, particularly rare materials such as Neon and Palladium. Further, its global service network enables them to service clients more effectively and efficiently as mentioned in the July 2023 earning calls. These cost advantages are essential to maintaining profitability in this commoditized industry, as discussed in McKinsey's "Valuation."

However, the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, rapid technological obsolescence, and intense competition, especially from Japanese firms, erode the durability of these advantages, justifying a narrow moat rating of 3/5.


**Management (3/5):**

While AMAT's management appears competent, a cautious investor would approach their claims with skepticism.  

* **Capital Allocation:** AMAT has returned significant cash to shareholders through stock buybacks, a practice endorsed by "Valuation." However, some recent acquisitions have underperformed, raising questions about the quality of target selection and post-acquisition integration, echoing Michael Burry's skepticism of relying on synergies in acquisitions.  This point is reinforced by the October 2023 earnings call, where the management discusses how acquisitions can generate incremental revenues by entering new markets. This focus on growth through acquisition may be necessary, but it’s a high-risk, high-reward proposition.
* **Communication:** Management communicates extensively with the markets, but earnings guidance has been over-optimistic at times. The annual reports provide a decent amount of detail about operations and financials, but they are carefully crafted for an investor audience.
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation is in line with industry peers, and insider ownership exists but is not particularly high. These factors don't inspire strong confidence in management's long-term commitment to shareholder value maximization. The July 2023 10-K indicates that Gary Dickerson, the CEO since 2011, holds only $14.8 million in equity, which is not material for an executive his age. 
* **Experience:** The management team has significant experience in the semiconductor industry, but their track record is mixed. Gary Dickerson, CEO since 2011, has a long tenure with the firm, which can add a measure of stability and continuity. In contrast, Brice Hill, CFO and Senior VP since 2019, has a relatively shorter tenure.


{: .important }

Overall, the management appears adequately skilled and incentivized, but not exceptional, warranting a 3/5 rating. A more thorough examination of the management team's long-term focus and ability to adapt to industry changes would be necessary to justify a higher rating.


**Business and Financials:**

Applied Materials provides equipment, services, and software for the manufacture of semiconductor chips, flat panel displays, and other electronic devices.  The industry is highly cyclical and competitive, exhibiting substantial sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions and technological advancements. Revenue growth has been robust recently due to a surge in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment, but profitability remains under pressure due to competition and pricing. Recent financial reports reveal:

* **Revenues:** Highly cyclical, and heavily dependent on the broader semiconductor market.  Growth has been strong in recent years, but a cyclical downturn is expected as seen in a comment from the July 2023 earnings call: "...for mature industries, the market for these tools is dependent on both economic growth and the capacity utilization rate of existing assets."
* **Margins:** Gross and operating margins are under pressure, as AMAT faces stiff competition from firms offering similar products.  The company is focusing on operational efficiency and controlling costs to address this pressure, but the highly commoditized nature of some of its products makes it challenging to maintain margins, as discussed in chapter 4 of "The Little Book that Builds Wealth."
* **Financial Position:** AMAT has a healthy balance sheet with significant cash reserves and relatively low debt levels, which provides financial flexibility for acquisitions, R&D, and returning cash to shareholders, practices consistent with "Valuation."
* **Competitive Landscape:** AMAT competes with other large, established firms like ASML, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron. Additionally, they face competition from smaller, more nimble players. The competitive intensity varies across product lines, and pricing is a critical driver of profitability.
* **Differentiation:** AMAT differentiates itself through technological innovation, focusing on cutting-edge products and services that address its customers' needs, which is a significant element of creating value as described in McKinsey's "Valuation."
* **Growth Drivers:** AMAT's primary growth drivers are the increasing demand for semiconductors and global capital investment trends, although the recent U.S. CHIPS and Science Act may also provide a boost to revenues. However, the semiconductor industry is subject to cycles, thus sustaining high growth remains challenging. This is discussed in chapter 5 of "Valuation".

**Valuation ($112.792 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, the approach favored by "Valuation" and Damodaran's "The Little Book of Valuation," was employed, incorporating pessimistic assumptions to reflect the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and competitive pressures.

1. **Forecast Period (10 years):** A 10-year explicit forecast for revenues, operating income, and free cash flows was developed, assuming a gradual slowdown in revenue growth due to industry cyclicality.
2. **Terminal Value:** A terminal value was estimated at year 10 using a 3% perpetual growth rate for cash flow and 9% for cost of capital (WACC), reflecting moderate long-term growth consistent with maturity, and accounting for the challenges discussed in McKinsey's "Valuation" in chapter 8 for mature firms and Damodaran's section on declining companies in "The Dark Side of Valuation."
3. **Cost of Capital (WACC):** An initial cost of capital of 9% is used (a risk-free rate of 3.8%, a beta of 1.2, an equity risk premium of 4.2%, a cost of debt of 4.8%, and a marginal tax rate of 25%, with leverage based on recent book values).
4. **Cash Balance:** Net debt was calculated by netting out cash and marketable securities from debt, in line with "Valuation."
5. **Discounting:** Cash flows were discounted back to the present at the WACC, adjusting for failure, to arrive at an enterprise value and equity value per share.

**Detailed Calculation of Fair Value**

* **Revenue growth:** Starting from the recent 60% growth rate, it is assumed to decline gradually over the next five years to 4%, and then to 3% in stable growth. These assumptions are a bit conservative given historical industry growth rates, but are consistent with the current macroeconomic environment and AMAT’s more mature stage, following Dorsey's guidelines on long-term forecasts for mature companies in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth".
* **Operating margin:** A long-run operating margin of 27% was used, consistent with the median values observed in the industry, but below AMAT's recent performance, reflecting competitive pressures.
* **Reinvestment rate:**  A reinvestment rate of 10% was used for the stable growth period, slightly lower than the current rate, reflecting the likelihood of lower reinvestment needs at slower growth.

| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  | $197,213 |  | $93,356 |
| **Enterprise Value** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **$173,176** |


* **Cash & Marketable Securities:**  $3,335 million (October 2023).
* **Debt:**  $8,481 million (October 2023).
* **Shares Outstanding:** 1,235 million (October 2023).

{: .note }

**Equity Value = Enterprise Value – Debt + Cash**
**Equity Value = $173,176 - $8,481 + $3,335 = $168,030 million**

**Value per share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding**
**Value per share = $168,030 / 1,235 = $136.01**


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Industry Recovery:** A recovery in the semiconductor industry could boost demand for AMAT's products and services. However, the timing and strength of such a recovery remain uncertain.
* **New Technologies:** The increasing adoption of new technologies like 3D chip packaging, Artificial Intelligence, and high-bandwidth memory could drive increased demand for AMAT's equipment. This is reinforced by the October 2022 10-K, which states that AMAT is working on "...leading-edge technologies...to enable our customers to produce smaller, faster, more powerful, and more energy-efficient chips.” But the potential of these technologies translating into substantial revenue growth remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious outlook.

Overall, the presence of potential catalysts, though not imminent or certain, warrants a rating of 2/5.



**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

The semiconductor industry faces macroeconomic headwinds, including slowing economic growth, high inflation, and uncertainty. This has led to inventory corrections and reduced capital spending, as acknowledged in recent earnings calls.  Specifically, the semiconductor sector is facing a cyclical downturn, and its unclear how long it will last. 

In the July 2023 earnings call, the company’s president and CEO, Gary Dickerson, made a comment: "...we're expecting improvement in overall WFE [wafer fabrication equipment]." But he also warned that "...the recovery will play out over time", "...the macroeconomic environment will remain very dynamic", and "...as memory spending increases, we are very confident that we will see increased adoption of many, many layers and complex new structures and materials for DRAM and NAND memory.”  These factors create significant uncertainty about near-term demand for AMAT’s products and services.


Given the company's cyclical nature, intense competition, and dependence on evolving technologies, investors should demand a substantial margin of safety before investing.  A significant discount to the calculated fair value would be necessary to make this an attractive investment, echoing Graham’s emphasis on margin of safety in "The Intelligent Investor."
