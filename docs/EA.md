>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


Management receives a rating of 3, reflecting a mixed track record. While EA has delivered solid returns on invested capital historically, there are concerns about its capital allocation, specifically its history of acquisitions, as discussed in McKinsey's *Valuation*.  

Catalyst rating is 2,  reflecting potential upside from new game releases and growth in live services, tempered by industry competition and potential macroeconomic headwinds.

**Valuation:** $44.5B

**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations:**


>We will use a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, as recommended by Aswath Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*, focusing on **free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)**, rather than just earnings, to arrive at the enterprise value, as this valuation methodology gives a better understanding of how efficiently the underlying business creates value. A 10-year explicit forecast period is used to allow for more detailed forecasts.



* **Revenue Growth:** For the first five years, revenue growth is projected at 2%, in line with the lower bound of industry growth expectations, reflecting a cautious outlook on the macroeconomic environment.  Beyond year 5, growth tapers down to a steady state of 1%, as per the long-run U.S. GDP growth rate, reflecting competitive pressures and product life cycle challenges as discussed in McKinsey's *Valuation*.

* **Operating Margin:**  A base-case operating margin of 23.5% is assumed, slightly below historical averages. This conservative approach acknowledges management's efforts to improve margins, but also recognizes potential pressures from increased competition.

* **Reinvestment Rate:** A reinvestment rate of 25% of after-tax operating income is assumed, reflecting the need for continued investment in game development.

* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  A WACC of 9% is used, reflecting the industry average and EA's relatively stable capital structure. This estimate is based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5%, and a beta of 0.85, all in line with current market conditions.

* **Terminal Value:** The terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity growth method, with a 1% growth rate and the 9% WACC.

**FCFF Calculation:**

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Operating Margin | EBIT ($M) | Reinvestment Rate | FCFF ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 7.6 | 23.5% | 1,786 | 25% | 1,340 |
| 2 | 7.8 | 23.5% | 1,831 | 25% | 1,373 |
| 3 | 7.9 | 23.5% | 1,877 | 25% | 1,406 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | 9.1 | 23.5% | 2,139 | 25% | 1,604 |
| Terminal Year |  |  |  |  | 21,097 |

**Present Value of FCFF:**

The present value of the FCFF is calculated by discounting each year's cash flows at the 9% WACC. The present value of the terminal value is also discounted back to the present. The sum of these present values represents the enterprise value.

**Enterprise Value to Equity Value:**

From the enterprise value, we subtract debt and other non-equity claims to arrive at the equity value. Based on EA's latest financial statements, we use a debt value of $2B. We also incorporate other non-operating assets, like cash and marketable securities, which amount to $3.5 billion. 

**(Enterprise Value - Debt + Cash) / Shares Outstanding = Intrinsic Value per share**


The resulting intrinsic value per share is around **$130**.

**Business Overview:**

EA's business model revolves around developing and publishing video games across various platforms. Revenue is generated through game sales, live services (in-game purchases, subscriptions), and advertising.

* **Revenue Distribution:**  EA's largest revenue segment is Live Services, followed by Full Game PC and Console sales.  Mobile gaming also contributes meaningfully to revenue.  This reliance on live services, as discussed in *Valuation*, provides recurring revenue and reduces dependence on individual game releases.

* **Industry Trends:** The gaming industry is growing, driven by increasing gamer penetration and the rise of esports. However, as Aswath Damodaran points out in *The Little Book of Valuation*, competition is fierce, and technological disruption is constant.  The industry is also seeing increasing consolidation, with larger players acquiring smaller studios.

* **Margins:** EA's operating margins have been relatively stable, albeit under pressure from increasing development costs. 

* **Competitive Landscape:** EA faces competition from other large game publishers (Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive) as well as smaller, independent studios. EA's key differentiator is its portfolio of established franchises (*FIFA*, *Madden NFL*, *The Sims*, *Apex Legends*) which have strong network effects and customer loyalty, acting as key competitive advantages, as per the discussion on moats in Dorsey's book.


**Financials In-Depth:**

* **Revenue and Earnings Growth:** EA has delivered consistent revenue and earnings growth over the past five years. The company's focus on live services has contributed to this growth, by providing recurring revenue. EA's recent earnings calls emphasize the importance of live services for future growth. 

* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** EA's ROIC has been healthy historically, generally exceeding its cost of capital, a sign of a company with a solid competitive advantage, as explained in McKinsey's *Valuation*.

* **Capital Allocation:** EA's capital allocation decisions have been a subject of some debate. The company has made a number of large acquisitions, some of which have been more successful than others.  As noted by Damodaran, this is a crucial element in any successful valuation. Recent acquisitions have been smaller in size and seem more strategically focused.

* **Balance Sheet:** EA has a relatively healthy balance sheet, with moderate levels of debt.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

> Recent investor concerns have centered on the impact of the slowing economy on game sales, as well as increased competition. EA's management has addressed these concerns in recent earnings calls, emphasizing the strength of its live services business and its commitment to delivering new and engaging content. (Q3 2023 EA earnings call). Management acknowledges that a significant portion of future growth will come from Mobile gaming and plans to continue to push into this space. (Q1 2024 EA earnings call).


**Management Assessment:**

Management quality is a crucial component of moat assessment, as explored in *The Little Book of Valuation*. While EA's management team has deep industry experience, its record is mixed.

* **History/Experience:** The management team has been in place for several years and has a proven track record in the gaming industry. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance, but some stock options have raised concerns in past years. The current CEO, Andrew Wilson, has been in place since 2013 and has expertise in strategy, restructuring, marketing and operations.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, which can be a concern for aligning management and shareholder interests.
* **Communication:** EA's investor relations team provides regular updates and guidance. Its CEO clearly lays out the company's long-term vision for the industry. (Q3 2023 EA earnings call)
* **Capital Allocation:** As mentioned earlier, EA's acquisition history is mixed. Recent acquisitions and the growth of mobile gaming, point towards better capital allocation decision-making.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **New game releases:**  EA has a strong pipeline of upcoming game releases, including new installments in its established franchises.  These releases have the potential to drive revenue growth and re-engage players. 
* **Growth in live services:** EA's live services business, including in-game purchases and subscriptions, has the potential to continue growing. This recurring revenue stream could provide stability and predictability to EA's financials.
* **Esports:**  The continued growth of esports could provide additional revenue and marketing opportunities.


>**Overall, while EA possesses a narrow moat and a management team with a mixed record, its valuation based on a DCF model using pessimistic assumptions suggests that the stock is trading at a reasonable price, offering a margin of safety, and the potential for future growth and live services are upside catalysts.**
