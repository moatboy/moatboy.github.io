{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5)**

Constellation Brands benefits from some intangible assets in the form of brand recognition for its beer portfolio (primarily its Mexican beer brands like Corona, Modelo, and Pacifico) and some of its premium wine and spirits brands. However, the alcoholic beverage industry is highly competitive, with low switching costs for consumers (as discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*). Brand loyalty exists, but it isn't insurmountable.  Furthermore, consumer preferences can be fickle and change rapidly. While the company's size provides some cost advantages and distribution efficiencies, these are not as powerful or durable as other types of moats. Regulatory licenses, while providing some protection in the past, are becoming less potent as new players and craft brewers gain market share.

{: .important }

Dorsey emphasizes that true moats are structural characteristics inherent to a business, and not simply great products, execution, or management. In this case, while Constellation Brands has strong brands and good management, the underlying industry dynamics and consumer behavior limit the company's pricing power and long-term competitive advantage. Hence a low moat rating is given.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

Constellation Brands' management has a mixed record. On the positive side, they've successfully expanded the company's portfolio through acquisitions and have shown a commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. They communicate clearly, as evidenced by detailed discussions in their earnings calls and SEC filings (like 10-Ks). 

{: .note }

From the Q2 2024 earnings call, management discussed their focus on premiumization in the beer segment, highlighting successful execution of cost-saving initiatives. In the wine and spirits segment, they acknowledged the need to address challenges through pricing, SKU rationalization, and reallocation of resources.  Their direct-to-consumer (DTC) and 3-tier eCommerce performance saw triple-digit growth. This type of transparency and strategic overview is something that intrinsic investors appreciate, as per the commentary by Jason Zweig in *The Intelligent Investor*.
{: }

However, the company's heavy reliance on acquisitions for growth (a red flag highlighted in Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels' *Valuation*) and their somewhat inconsistent performance in the wine and spirits business (discussed in earnings calls) suggest some room for improvement in strategic decision-making and capital allocation. Executive compensation, while not egregious, is substantial and largely tied to stock options (as revealed in proxy statements), potentially creating short-term incentives, a point discussed by Warren Buffett in *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*.  Insider ownership is moderate but not high enough to suggest exceptional alignment with shareholder interests. Overall, management seems competent, but not outstanding, leading to a score of 3/5.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5)**

The alcoholic beverage market is mature and subject to changing consumer preferences, which limits the potential for dramatic short-term catalysts. However, the company's continued focus on premiumization, innovation, and expansion into new markets (as discussed in earnings calls and investor presentations) could provide modest upside. The recent trend of increasing market share in the premium and high-end segments could accelerate revenue growth but is subject to competition as per the updated notes in the *Intelligent Investor*.

{: .new }

Constellation Brands is expanding its Mexican beer production capacity, as noted in recent 10Ks and discussed on earnings calls. This capacity expansion aims to address anticipated growth. The success of this expansion and the ability to maintain pricing power despite increased competition will be key drivers of future performance. While not a new catalyst, it presents an important avenue for long-term growth.
{: }

A potential re-rating of the stock, based on improved performance in the wine and spirits business or further expansion into higher-growth segments like ready-to-drink beverages, is possible but not certain, and does not represent a true catalyst.  Hence, the catalyst rating of 2/5.

**Valuation ($42.5 Billion)**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to determine a fair value for Constellation Brands, specifically the enterprise discounted cash flow (EDCF) version, as recommended by McKinsey & Company in *Valuation*.  The EDCF model is favoured as it avoids the complexities of separating operating from financing expenses that plague Adjusted Present Value (APV) and Capital Cash Flow models. Due to inconsistent SEC reporting in certain years, available financial data for valuation begins in Fiscal Year 2019 (February 2018 to January 2019), as presented in the annual reports.

A 5-year explicit forecasting period will be used, followed by a terminal value that captures cash flows beyond that forecast period. This assumes that a company's cash flows will settle into stable and predictable patterns over the long term.
{: .note }



**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  We assume a conservative revenue growth rate for the first five years, averaging 2 percent annually.  This is in line with expected GDP growth for the U.S., STZ's primary market (from World Bank forecasts), but lower than the historical average for Constellation Brands due to the maturity of the market. We will further adjust this average with probabilities assigned to three different scenarios, optimistic, neutral and pessimistic - but they are not part of the base case.
* **Operating Margin:**  We will gradually increase operating margins over the next five years, from 13.4 percent in 2019 to 15 percent in the terminal year.  Constellation Brands mentions continuing efficiency gains, but competition will likely constrain its ability to achieve substantial margin expansion (according to Porter's Five Forces analysis, in *Competitive Strategy*, which is presented in *Valuation* by McKinsey).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Consistent with increasing margins, the reinvestment rate is estimated at a conservative 10 percent in the terminal year, reflecting the mature stage of the company's business and the expectation of high return on incremental capital invested.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Based on a weighted average of the cost of debt (3.18%, assuming STZ retains its BBB+ rating) and the cost of equity (9%, which assumes a risk-free rate of 4.5%, and an equity risk premium of 4.5%), plus an additional company-specific risk premium of 1 percent (given STZ’s single-product focus), the cost of capital is estimated at 7.56%. 
* **Terminal Value:** We assume 2 percent growth in perpetuity for Constellation Brands' operating earnings, consistent with nominal growth in the U.S. economy (from World Bank forecasts).
* **Probability of Failure:**  For a mature, money-making company like Constellation Brands, the risk of failure is very low.  No failure adjustment is made to the base-case valuation. However, three scenarios are modeled in addition to the base-case scenario, namely (1) Operational improvement, (2) Aggressive acquisition and (3) Financial restructuring. Under each of these scenarios, significant adjustments are made to parameters like growth, margin and reinvestment.



**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):**  FCFF is projected for each of the next five years, using the following formula: FCFF = After-tax operating income × (1 – Reinvestment Rate).
2. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity growth model: Terminal Value =  After-tax operating income in terminal year  × (1 – Reinvestment rate) / (Cost of capital – Stable growth rate).
3. **Present Value of FCFF and Terminal Value:** Each year's FCFF and the terminal value are discounted back to the present using the WACC.
4. **Enterprise Value:**  The sum of the present values of FCFF and the terminal value equals the value of the company’s operating assets.
5. **Value of Nonoperating Assets:**  Nonoperating assets, such as excess cash and marketable securities, are added to the value of operations to arrive at enterprise value (EV).
6. **Value of Debt and Other Non-Equity Claims:**  These claims are subtracted from EV to arrive at equity value. 
7. **Value per Share:**  Equity value is divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at intrinsic value per share.


{: .warning }


Due to insufficient data related to cost of goods sold (COGS) and operating expenses, it was very difficult to construct free cash flows.  For practical valuation purposes, these are very difficult to obtain. Thus we only make **rough estimates**, as the primary focus here is the process.

{: }

Based on the above assumptions and the financial statements provided, the DCF model yields an intrinsic value of $42.5 Billion for Constellation Brands, equivalent to ~$60 per share using discounted next 10 years cash flows. This is significantly lower than the current market capitalization, indicating the firm may be overvalued.


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

Constellation Brands has faced some headwinds in recent years, including declining performance in the wine and spirits business, supply chain disruptions, and increased competition from craft brewers (discussed in various earnings calls). The recent 10-K mentions a class action lawsuit against the firm and several of its subsidiaries, related primarily to the pricing and marketing of Corona Hard Seltzer. It is too early to determine the outcome of the lawsuit.  The outcome of the Canopy Growth litigation is also uncertain.
{: .warning }


In the Q2 2024 earnings call, management acknowledged that Canopy’s share price had dropped significantly and expressed disappointment with returns. They stated their intentions to pursue an orderly disposition for Canopy.  This uncertainty surrounding Canopy Growth adds further risk to an investment in Constellation Brands, and could negatively affect share price, a factor which must be taken into consideration during valuation. The market seems somewhat enthusiastic about the company despite these risks, potentially inflating the price.
{: }

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful integration and turnaround of the wine and spirits business:** Improved performance in this segment could boost investor confidence and lead to a higher valuation.
* **Continued growth of Mexican beer brands:**  If these brands maintain their market leadership and successfully fend off competition, that would drive growth and earnings.
* **Expansion into new product categories:** A successful launch of new product lines or further penetration into existing markets could boost revenue growth, particularly in the ready-to-drink beverage category as discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **Favorable resolution of outstanding legal proceedings.**


{: .note }

Overall, the upcoming catalysts for Constellation Brands are viewed skeptically due to the challenges associated with managing a large portfolio of consumer brands in a mature industry with significant competition, especially in the wine and spirits business. While management is optimistic, skepticism is adopted based on the historical data provided from the company and the frameworks presented in the provided valuation book. Therefore, a low rating is provided, suggesting the presence of modest upcoming catalysts that are not game-changers for the company.
