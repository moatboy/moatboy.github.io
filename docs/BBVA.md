>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

BBVA's moat rests primarily on its **scale and market share**, particularly in its core markets of Spain and Mexico. This provides some cost advantages and brand recognition, though these are not insurmountable for competitors.

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):**  BBVA has brand recognition in its core markets, but it's difficult to say whether this translates into pricing power. The financial services industry is increasingly commoditized, making brand loyalty less valuable. Therefore, its brand is not a significant source of competitive advantage.
* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs in retail banking are generally low. Customers can (and do) move their accounts fairly easily, especially with the rise of online banks.  
* **Network Effect:** The network effect is limited in traditional banking. While having more customers can lower costs through scale, it doesn't significantly enhance the value of the service for existing customers.  There's no evidence that people choose BBVA *because* other people use it.
* **Cost Advantages:** BBVA does benefit from economies of scale, but the potential cost savings are offset by the need to invest heavily in technology and comply with increasingly stringent regulations.  Furthermore, cost advantages can disappear quickly in a globalized environment due to competitive pressures.


Given the limited durability and strength of these competitive advantages, BBVA's moat is rated as **Narrow (2/5)**.  

**Management Analysis**

BBVA's management team has a mixed track record. While they have overseen periods of growth, they've also made some questionable capital allocation decisions.

* **Capital Allocation:** The bank's return on equity has been volatile. While it was high between 2005 and 2007, it dropped below the cost of equity in 2008 and has not recovered significantly since. Recent acquisitions in emerging markets have delivered inconsistent results.  Therefore, management's capital allocation abilities are rated as average (3/5). 
* **History/Experience:** BBVA has a long and storied history in the financial services industry. However, its experience did not prevent it from making value-destroying acquisitions in the 2000's or suffering losses during the 2008 financial crisis.  
* **Communication:**  The level of detail in investor communications could be improved. While the annual reports provide some information about the geographic breakdown of the business, more detailed information, such as revenues per geography or product, could give more insight into profitability. 
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is not excessively out of line with peers. It is primarily cash based on annual performance and includes a pension commitment upon retirement. 
* **Insider Ownership:** The company's executives and directors have some insider ownership. There's no evidence of egregious big share issuance to management.  

Overall, the management team’s execution has been mixed. They are not exceptionally poor or excellent, and therefore are rated average (3/5).

**Catalyst Analysis**

BBVA's primary catalyst for share price appreciation would be a re-rating by the market or an improvement in financial results. 

* **Potential Market Re-rating:** BBVA’s share price could rise if the market perceives that its risk-adjusted growth potential is higher than currently reflected in its price/book ratio.  This could happen in the medium term if the bank demonstrates improved profitability and consistent above-average returns on equity.
* **Improved Financial Results:**  BBVA's earnings could grow at a higher rate than expected, leading to share price increases.  This would be a result of either significant gains in market share or revenue/margin expansion from acquisitions.

Given the bank’s limited moat, a market re-rating in the near future is unlikely.  A turnaround in financial performance could increase the share price but would depend on the success of its turnaround strategy. Therefore, the catalyst is rated as **moderate (2/5)**.

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model will be used to value BBVA. The inputs include free cash flow (FCF), cost of capital, and terminal value. Given the substantial difficulty of estimating FCF for a bank, we used the dividend discount model for valuation instead, where cash flow to equity is replaced by dividends, which can be estimated based on net income.

* **Base Case:** We project continued slow revenue growth at 2 percent, in line with GDP. We anticipate improving margins over the next few years (reaching 12% by 2027) and maintaining a stable payout ratio of 45%.  We use a cost of equity of 9% for the business, reflecting the risk-free rate of 4.1%, a market risk premium of 4.5%, and the leverage and beta of the firm (1.10). Our terminal growth rate is 3%, in line with inflation. We assume that the bank's business model is mature and therefore unlikely to materially change over time.

* **Downside Case:** Revenues remain flat or decline in Europe (due to economic weakness in the eurozone) which accounts for the majority of BBVA's operating profits. The payout ratio would have to be reduced to less than 20% to ensure compliance with regulatory capital ratios.  

* **Upside Case:** Acquisitions in emerging markets outperform expectations and provide better growth prospects than anticipated. Margins improve at a faster pace thanks to cost-cutting measures.

**Business Analysis**

* **Revenues Distribution:** BBVA’s business is geographically diversified, with its operations primarily in Spain, Mexico, Turkey, and South America.  As of 2023, Spain accounts for 55% of the total, while Mexico accounts for 20%, Turkey accounts for 13% and the remainder (12%) is attributed to South America and the U.S.  Its revenues come primarily from retail banking (86%), followed by corporate banking (11%) and the rest (3%) can be attributed to its insurance and investment banking business. 
* **Industry Trends:** The financial services industry is undergoing significant change due to the rise of financial technology (fintech) companies, increased regulatory scrutiny, and pressure to lower costs. These trends are transforming BBVA's competitive landscape, requiring it to adapt its business model and invest in new technologies.
* **Margins:** BBVA's net interest margin is under pressure, declining from 2.28% in 2020 to 2.04% in 2021. Its margins have also been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
* **Competitive Landscape:** BBVA faces intense competition from other large banks in its core markets, as well as from smaller, more nimble fintech players.  It is struggling to differentiate its products and services and maintain market share in a challenging environment.
* **What Makes BBVA Different:**  BBVA has highlighted its digital transformation as a key differentiator.  However, almost every other bank has a similar strategy, so it's unlikely to be a sustainable source of competitive advantage.
* **Recent Concerns:**  In early 2023, an investigation by the Spanish financial authorities raised concerns about BBVA’s potential underreporting of loan losses in previous years and consequently its profitability in the recent past. This investigation has not yet led to a formal complaint by the authorities, and BBVA maintains that it hasn't understated its loan losses. However, such uncertainties make this company a high-risk investment and increase the amount of research necessary for a robust analysis.
