## Business Overview
{: .highlight }
Embraer is a significant player in the global aerospace industry, with revenues primarily driven by sales of commercial jets, followed by business and executive jets, as well as their defense and security segment.

*   **Commercial Aviation:** This division focuses on the design, development, and production of regional jets, with a strong emphasis on the E-Jet family. Commercial aviation sales are heavily impacted by global economic conditions and airline industry cycles, making it a somewhat volatile revenue stream.
*   **Executive Aviation:** This segment is responsible for the design, manufacture, and sale of executive jets, including the Phenom, Praetor, and Legacy series. Business jet demand is often more discretionary and responsive to fluctuations in wealth levels, adding some variability to this revenue stream.
*   **Defense & Security:** This segment includes military aircraft sales, government contracts for services, and other defense-related work. Defense contracts tend to provide more stable revenue streams, but they can be subject to budget cuts and program delays.
*   **Other segments:** This includes services and support, agriculture business etc.

### Industry Trends
*   **Commercial Aviation:** The airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Consolidation in the industry is ongoing, and there is an increasing demand for fuel-efficient, modern aircraft.
*   **Executive Aviation:** Demand for business jets is influenced by economic growth and wealth levels.
*   **Defense:** Defense budgets are driven by geopolitical factors. Demand for military aircraft is expected to remain stable and even grow with the changing geopolitical environment.
{: .important }
The industry as a whole has a high barrier to entry because it is very capital intensive, and regulations are pretty intense.

### Competitive Landscape
Embraer operates in a competitive landscape with the following competitors:
* **Commercial Aviation:** Airbus and Boeing are the strongest competitors in this segment
* **Executive Aviation:** Bombardier, Gulfstream, and Dassault are the main competitors in this segment.
* **Defense:** Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman, among others

### What Makes Embraer Different
* **Niche Focus:** While the company has some presence in the global aviation market, their specialization in the smaller end of commercial jets (regional jets), creates a different business model when compared to its peers, and their expertise in it.
* **Geographical Focus:** Embraer has a strong presence in the Brazilian market, and Latin America as a whole.
*   **Diversified Portfolio:** Embraer operates in both the commercial and defense markets, which provides some resilience against downturns in either.
*   **Strong Focus on Innovation:** Embraer has a proven ability to adapt its aircraft models with new technologies.

## Financials
{: .highlight }
Embraer's financials show a fluctuating business mainly driven by macro-economic factors. The company's revenues, profitability, and returns on capital, have gone through a significant transformation over the last years.

*   **Revenue Distribution:** Approximately 55-65% of revenue comes from commercial aircraft, 20-30% from defense and the remaining 15-20% from executive jets and other smaller segments.

*   **Trends:**
    *   A revenue of approximately $4.9 Billion in 2022 increased to $5.0 Billion in 2023, and profits went from $87 Million to $245 Million.
    *   A significant increase in services and support revenues due to increased travel. 
    *   A significant increase in aircraft deliveries.
    *   Continued supply chain disruptions, high inflation, and talent shortages.

*   **Profitability:**
    *   EBITDA margin was 8.6% in 2022 and 15.5% in 2023. 
    *  Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is 5.9% in 2023, down from 7.1% in 2022. This indicates a moderate return rate.
*  **Cost structure:** Costs are influenced by raw materials, employee compensation, currency fluctuations and sales volumes.
*   **Capital Structure:** 
  *   The debt-to-equity ratio is approximately 1.2 which is considered a bit leveraged.
  *   Free Cash Flow has been negative but is expected to be positive in 2024 due to expected increase in aircraft deliveries.

*   **Debt and Leverage:**
  *   Embraer's reliance on debt for funding has led to higher debt levels.
  *    Higher interest rates pose a risk for Embraer to repay debt, even though their debt is mainly long-term.
*   **Cash Flow:**
     *  Negative cash flows is not sustainable long term.
     *  The management has mentioned an increase in free cash flow as a priority.
*  **Valuation Metrics**:
    *  The market cap is relatively low at $3.7 billion, when compared to its peers, although such a difference is explained in part by its geographic focus.
    *  Price-to-earnings ratio is 15, while price-to-book ratio is 1.2. These numbers are around the same range of what its peers are trading.

### Recent Concerns and Management's Response
{: .warning }

*  **Supply Chain Issues:** Embraer's management has acknowledged persistent supply chain issues and rising input costs, which have delayed deliveries and pressured profit margins, they are working to reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions by diversifying their suppliers, developing alternative suppliers and manufacturing the components themselves.
*  **Inflation:** The company is experiencing high inflationary pressures that affect costs. Management has said they are working to control the increasing prices by increasing sales efficiency and product pricing.
* **Net losses and negative free cash flow:** The company has been producing operating losses and negative free cash flow for some time. The management has explained that this will be fixed once the supply chain issues resolve and they can deliver the orders that are already booked, they have also been emphasizing that their new and more effective planes will lead to better results.
*   **Labor Shortages**: Embraer has taken steps to maintain its workforce, while new hirings are also happening, all of this while implementing measures to improve labor efficiency and reduce overtime costs.
*   **High Debts**: The company is working to lower its debt-to-equity ratio and has been trying to avoid major acquisitions to focus solely on lowering debt.

## Moat Rating: 2/5
Embraer has a narrow moat due to its:

*   **Intangible Assets:** The company's brand recognition and established reputation for producing high-quality aircraft provide a competitive advantage.

*  **Switching Costs:** The highly customized nature of aircraft sales, especially in the defense industry, makes it costly for customers to switch suppliers once a relationship is established.

However, the moat is considered narrow because:
*   **Limited Pricing Power:** Embraer’s product portfolio is in very competitive segments and they don't have much room to raise prices.
*  **High Competition:** They have strong global competitors that can replicate almost all of their business strategies.
*   **Vulnerability to Economic Cycles:** The company's sales and profitability are highly vulnerable to changes in economic conditions and geopolitical events.
*    **Technology and Disruption:** The rapid pace of technological development and new manufacturing techniques, could be an industry disruptor.

## Understandability: 3 / 5
*   **Moderate Complexity:** The different operating segments and the factors that drive their performance add some complexity to understanding the company, as does the impact of macro-economic conditions and industry cycles.
*  **Complex Financials:** It requires effort to fully understand the complexities and nuances of the company's financial statements, such as the different types of equity and how it is all interconnected.
*  **Unique Industry:** The dynamics and peculiarities of the aerospace industry makes it more difficult to grasp, especially if you have no prior understanding.

## Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5
*  **Moderate Leverage:** While not excessively leveraged, the amount of debt is a point of concern and can be problematic if profits or returns on invested capital don't meet the expectations.
*   **Negative Free Cash Flow:** The company is currently unable to finance its operations through free cash flow, which presents challenges and makes it more dependent on external sources of funding.
*    **Some Liquidity:** The company does have some available cash and cash equivalents. It is important to keep the ability to meet short term obligations.
*  **Future Contingencies:** Company is working to deleverage and make their balance sheet more durable.

## Conclusion
Embraer is a company with narrow, but some economic moat. Its revenue and profits are subject to variability related to factors it doesn’t control. Management is aiming for improvements in financial metrics which might prove useful in the long term.
