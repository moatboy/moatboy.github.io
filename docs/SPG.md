{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

SPG possesses a narrow moat based on intangible assets (brand) and economies of scale. 

* **Brand:** SPG's properties, particularly its "Class A" malls, benefit from brand recognition and a reputation for quality. This allows them to attract high-end retailers and charge premium lease rates. *However, the brand strength of a mall is less durable than that of a consumer product company like Coca-Cola*, as evidenced by the struggles of many malls in the face of e-commerce competition. SPG's brand is therefore rated a 3 out of 5.
* **Economies of Scale:**  SPG's size gives it several advantages, including lower costs for mall services and greater bargaining power with retailers. *However, mall acquisitions can come at a steep price and often fail to deliver on promised synergies, potentially diminishing returns*. This limits the strength of its economies of scale to a 3 out of 5 rating.


**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** SPG's management has a mixed record on capital allocation. While the company has been a prodigious acquirer of properties, some of these acquisitions have been questioned for their price and strategic fit.  The company's continued investment in brick-and-mortar retail during the rise of e-commerce could be viewed as a strategic misstep by some.  This justifies a 3 out of 5 for capital allocation. *During the Q3 2019 earnings call, the management expressed its commitment to physical retail, focusing on redevelopment and densification projects instead of ground-up developments*.
* **Communication:** Management's communication with investors has been generally transparent, but their optimistic pronouncements during the recent retail downturn have not always materialized. This warrants a rating of 3 out of 5. *In the Q1 2021 earnings call, CEO David Simon acknowledged the changing retail environment and discussed strategies for adapting to it, including e-commerce and omnichannel retail*. 
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation is in line with industry peers, and insider ownership is moderate. This receives a neutral rating of 3 out of 5.
* **Overall:** Considering SPG management's mixed record on capital allocation and somewhat rosy outlooks, combined with a moderate compensation and insider ownership, we arrive at a management rating of 3 out of 5. *In the Q4 2022 earnings call, CFO Brian McDade highlighted the company's strong balance sheet and liquidity position, allowing for flexibility in navigating economic uncertainty*.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* The recovery of the retail sector after the pandemic could serve as a potential catalyst, but the long-term secular decline of brick-and-mortar retail remains a significant headwind. This warrants a cautious rating of 2 out of 5. *In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management addressed the headwinds facing the retail sector, including the rise of e-commerce and the shift in consumer preferences.  They highlighted their strategic response to these changes, focusing on experience, convenience, and omnichannel retail*.

**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** SPG's revenues are generated primarily from rental income (mall stores, anchors, specialty leasing, other tenants) across a geographically diversified portfolio.
* **Industry Trends:** The shopping mall industry faces significant headwinds due to e-commerce competition. The industry is in a mature phase of development and consolidating.
* **Margins:** SPG's operating margins are relatively high due to premium lease rates, but they are under pressure due to declining occupancy rates and rising operating expenses.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The competitive landscape for malls is intensifying, with e-commerce being a significant threat. SPG competes with other mall REITs and also with online retailers. *What differentiates SPG is its focus on higher-quality malls and outlets*, which are expected to be more resilient to e-commerce disruption.
* **Other Relevant Factors:** Management plays a critical role, as does the balance sheet strength and capital allocation decisions of the REIT.

**Financials:**

SPG's financial results have been affected by the recent downturn in the retail sector. The company's financial position is strong, with a reasonable amount of debt and access to capital markets. 

**Valuation ($13.6 Billion):**

>The information needed for valuing SPG is taken from the Simon Property Group Form 10-K, covering the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 and the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31, 2023, where applicable, and the Simon Property Group Form 10-Q, for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30, 2023.

* **Methodology:** Given the complexity of SPG (REIT structure and substantial operating leases), we will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach based on the net operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT) and free cash flow (FCF). Given the current and ongoing effects of the pandemic, we will also use a scenario approach.
* **Forecast Period:** 5 years (2024-2028) *because Simon Property Group needs to change to make itself relevant in an ever changing retail environment*.
* **Growth:** We will assume a conservative long-term growth rate of 1% for revenues, assuming a recovery from Covid related decline.
* **Margins:** We assume operating margins to remain stable.
* **Reinvestment:**  We assume a reinvestment rate of 25%, considering capital expenditures on mall redevelopment and expansion activities, but less than historical average.
* **Cost of Capital:**  We will use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.5%, reflecting retail risk and SPG's credit rating. Assuming a risk-free rate of 3.5%, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, and a cost of debt of 5% (based on its bond yields).
* **Terminal Value:**  We will use a perpetual growth rate of 1% (lower than the risk-free rate to ensure conservatism)  and a stable-growth return on invested capital (ROIC) of 5%.

| Year | NOPLAT  | Growth | ROIC | WACC | FCF | Present Value of FCF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2024 | $2,611 | 1% | 5% | 7.5% | $2,255 | $1,943 |
| 2025 | $2,637 | 1% | 5% | 7.5% | $2,277 | $1,868 |
| 2026 | $2,663 | 1% | 5% | 7.5% | $2,299 | $1,796 |
| 2027 | $2,690 | 1% | 5% | 7.5% | $2,322 | $1,727 |
| 2028 | $2,717 | 1% | 5% | 7.5% | $2,345 | $1,660 |
| Terminal Value |  | 1% | 5% | 7.5% | $49,813 | $32,571|


* **Present Value of Operating Assets:**  The sum of the present values of the FCF is approximately $42,565 million.
* **Nonoperating Assets:**  We assume Simon Property Group's nonoperating assets, consisting of its consolidated investments, to be roughly $100 million. 
* **Total Firm Value:** Summing up the operating asset value and the nonoperating asset value provides us with a total firm value of $42,665 million.
* **Debt:** We will use the book value of debt (approximately $20 billion, according to 2022 10-K). We assume no debt financing for our free cash flow analysis from 2024 to 2028.
* **Equity Value:**  Subtracting debt from firm value gives us an equity value of approximately $22,665 million.
* **Shares Outstanding:** Based on the number of common shares outstanding, we have approximately 400 million shares.
* **Value per Share:**  Dividing by the number of shares gives a value per share of around $56.7.



**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Decline in Mall Traffic:**  The decline in mall traffic due to e-commerce is a major concern. Management has been addressing this through investments in omnichannel retail, redevelopment projects, and diversification. *During the Q4 2022 earnings call, management acknowledged the challenges facing malls and highlighted the importance of adapting to the changing retail landscape*.
* **Debt Levels:** SPG's debt levels are reasonably moderate, but some investors have expressed concerns about the company's financial leverage. Management has emphasized its focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. *During the Q3 2022 earnings call, management provided updates on the company's debt-reduction initiatives*.

**Concluding Remarks:**

SPG is a well-managed REIT with a narrow moat based on its brand strength and economies of scale.  However, the retail landscape is changing rapidly, and the long-term viability of the mall REIT business model is uncertain.  The current share price seems to be fairly valued according to our DCF model. However, given the uncertainty in the sector, a margin of safety should be applied, meaning that a lower purchase price would be more attractive. *Given the industry trends and its unique position in the luxury retail landscape, there exists an option premium for SPG's ability to adapt to changes*.
