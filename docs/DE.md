**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Deere's revenues are derived from three main segments:
    * **Production & Precision Agriculture (79%):** This segment comprises the company's core business of manufacturing and distributing agricultural equipment, including large and small tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters, and precision ag technology solutions. The segment also provides parts and maintenance services. North America accounts for the majority of this segment's revenue, with a growing presence in other regions worldwide.
    * **Small Agriculture & Turf (11%):** This segment encompasses the production and distribution of smaller agricultural and turf equipment, as well as related parts, primarily for residential, commercial, golf, and government customers. This segment faces significant competition from other equipment manufacturers.
    * **Construction & Forestry (10%):** This segment focuses on the production and distribution of construction and forestry equipment, such as excavators, loaders, and roadbuilding equipment.  This segment is more cyclical than the agricultural business and has faced headwinds in recent years, primarily due to lower housing starts and commodity prices. In addition, Deere has a financial services segment that provides financing and leasing options to customers, but its relative impact is small compared to the other segments.

* **Industry Trends:** The agricultural machinery industry is subject to cyclical patterns, driven by crop prices and farmer income.  Technological advancements, such as precision agriculture and automation, are transforming the industry. Increased competition in the sector has exerted downward pressure on prices. The construction industry is even more cyclical than agriculture. Consolidation has been a key trend across the industry.

* **Margins:** Deere's margins have been relatively stable, albeit with a downward trend due to intense competition.  Its operating margins have historically been around 15%, but have faced some pressure recently.

**Moat Analysis**

Deere's moat is primarily based on the following sources of competitive advantage:

{: .warning }
1. **Intangible Assets (Brand):**  The John Deere brand is highly recognized and respected among farmers, conveying quality, durability, and innovation.  This brand recognition allows the company to command premium pricing for its products. However, the strength of the brand is limited to agricultural equipment, the core business of John Deere, and does not extend to construction, forestry, and turf equipment segments.
{: .important }
2. **Switching Costs:** Deere has cultivated a loyal customer base, particularly in the agricultural segment.  Farmers are often reluctant to switch brands due to the integration of Deere's equipment with their existing machinery, the availability of specialized parts and service through Deere's extensive dealer network, and the learning curve associated with using different brands of precision agriculture equipment. This integration of technology creates high switching costs for customers.
{: .warning }
3. **Cost Advantages:** Deere benefits from economies of scale in its manufacturing and distribution operations, particularly in the production of large agricultural equipment.  These cost advantages are, however, lessened due to the availability of cheaper equipment from competitors.
**Moat Rating Justification**

Deere earns a moat rating of 3 out of 5, indicating a narrow moat. While the company benefits from strong brand recognition among agricultural customers, a robust dealer network providing services, and significant switching costs, it faces intense competition from other equipment manufacturers.

**Valuation**

We used a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model to estimate Deere's intrinsic value. Our valuation uses data from Deere's 2023 annual report and financial releases.  We also looked at valuation multiples and peer groups to validate our output.

{: .important }
>> Given the cyclical nature of Deere's businesses, we made somewhat pessimistic assumptions for the company’s future performance, which makes it difficult for both newcomers and shareholders to increase their returns on the investments they made.

**Key Valuation Assumptions and Calculations**

1. **Revenue Growth:** We forecast revenue growth of 2% annually over the next five years (through 2028) before gradually declining to a long-run steady state of 1% in perpetuity. This growth estimate reflects our pessimistic and skeptical outlook for the future of Deere's business.

2. **Operating Margin:** We assume an operating margin of 16.5% in the terminal year.

3. **Sales to Capital:**  We assume a sales-to-capital ratio of 1.20.

4. **Reinvestment Rate:** We project a reinvestment rate of 30% during the first five years, declining to 10% in perpetuity.

5. **Tax Rate:**  We assume a tax rate of 25%.

6. **Cost of Capital:**  Based on Deere’s bond rating of A, we estimate a cost of debt of 5%. Based on the median unlevered beta of John Deere's peers and peer group, we estimate a cost of equity of 9%. Given the company's capital structure, these assumptions lead to an overall cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%.

7. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value, estimated at the end of year 10, is calculated as follows:

```
Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 11) * (1 - Reinvestment rate) / (Cost of Capital - Stable growth rate)

Terminal Value = ($3,555.57 * 0.90) / (0.075 - 0.01) = $49,315.59 million
```

8. **Present Value of Cash Flows:**  Discounting the projected free cash flows (FCF) and the terminal value back to the present at the cost of capital yields a total present value of operations of $44,538.21 million.

9. **Nonoperating Assets:** Deere's nonoperating assets consist primarily of excess cash and marketable securities. These are valued at their book values. Adding the values of the nonoperating assets to the present value of cash flows from operations yields Deere's total enterprise value.

10. **Debt and Other Liabilities:**  We subtract Deere's debt and other non-equity claims from enterprise value to arrive at equity value.  This includes its debt obligations.

11. **Equity Value per Share:** We divide Deere's total equity value by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at a value per share of $171.27.

**Valuation Summary**

| Item | Amount ($ millions) |
|---|---|
| Present Value of Operating Assets | $44,538.21 |
| + Excess Cash and Marketable Securities | $11,040.40 |
| + Value of Minority Interests | $2,553.54 |
| – Debt and Other Liabilities | $20,070.66 |
| = Equity Value | $38,061.49 |
| Number of Shares Outstanding | 2,235 |
| Equity Value per Share | $170.47 |

Given Deere's stock price of around $438 per share (as of July 25, 2024) and our estimated equity value per share of $170.47, we believe the stock is significantly overvalued.

**Valuation Conclusion**

Our DCF model estimates Deere's equity value at approximately **$88.24 billion** ($170.47/share x 2,235 shares x 23.10 conversion ratio). We consider this to be a fair value estimate, given the company’s strong market position in the agricultural equipment industry, but also considering the challenges and headwinds it faces, particularly from increasing competition. Our valuation is significantly lower than the market capitalization of around $127 billion.
