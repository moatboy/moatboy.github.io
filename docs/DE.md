>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Deere benefits from two sources of competitive advantage, but neither is insurmountable:

1. **Brand and Dealer Network:**  Deere's brand is well recognized and respected by farmers, contributing to customer loyalty.  Its extensive dealer network provides parts, service, and support, creating switching costs for customers. *However, as highlighted in Pat Dorsey's "The Little Book that Builds Wealth," brand names in consumer goods often fail to provide pricing power,* and while Deere's products are expensive and specialized, this may erode over time as competitors emerge.  The dealer network, while extensive, can be replicated by competitors with sufficient resources and patience.

2. **Switching Costs:** Farmers who have invested in Deere's equipment and software ecosystem face some switching costs, as highlighted in Kenneth Fisher's "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits." *However, the rapid pace of technological change in agriculture may erode these advantages over time.*  Precision agriculture and autonomous driving features, while currently differentiating, may become commoditized as other companies adopt them.

**Management (3/5):**

Deere's management team receives a middling rating due to a few factors:

* **Capital Allocation:** Deere has historically reinvestment heavily in its business, which has led to long-term growth. However, its acquisition track record is mixed.  While some acquisitions have been successful, others have been less so, raising questions about management's ability to integrate acquired companies and create value through acquisitions.  *The company's push into precision agriculture may also come with pitfalls, similar to those faced by technology companies early in the development of new products or technologies, as described in Fisher's book.* The 2010-2019 financials indicate acquisitions were successful for Deere, but more recent financials suggest less success.
* **Communication:** Deere's investor relations materials are generally well produced and provide a reasonable amount of information about the company's strategy and financial performance. *However, management sometimes emphasizes short-term results over long-term value creation, a pattern also discussed in McKinsey's "Valuation," which can be dangerous.* While they discuss the strategy behind their margin targets in their 2023 annual report, there is little long-term discussion of how these strategies might unfold if the industry faces serious downturn or competitive pressures on the margin front.
* **Insider Ownership and Compensation:**  Executive compensation is largely tied to company performance, and several key executives and board members own Deere stock. *However, the amounts owned are not exceptionally high.*

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Deere's push into precision agriculture is a potential catalyst, but its success is uncertain. *The long-term payoff may be significant, but it will take time to realize,* and the technological and competitive landscapes are rapidly evolving.  As Fisher says in his 1958 book, "the early years of establishing...customer relationships in any new market must necessarily be those of relatively slow earnings."

**Business and Financials:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** Deere generates revenue from three primary segments: Production & Precision Agriculture (PPA), Small Agriculture & Turf (SAT), and Construction & Forestry (C&F).  PPA is the largest and most profitable segment.  The company operates globally, with North America being its largest market. Deere & Company derives its largest share of earnings in PPA from the sales of large agricultural equipment, which is sold largely in the United States, Canada, and Europe. As noted in the 2020 fourth-quarter earnings call, Deere derives 62% of revenue from North America.
* **Industry Trends:** The agricultural machinery industry is cyclical, driven by commodity prices and farm incomes. *As Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels highlight in "Valuation," valuing cyclical businesses requires careful normalization of earnings and cash flows*. The construction and forestry industries are also cyclical. The precision agriculture market is a growth area, but competition is increasing.  It's not clear from the documents provided whether Deere is successfully navigating competitive pressures in the high-growth segments of the agriculture machinery industry, but the decline in sales and profit margins in the recent financials indicates intensifying competition.
* **Margins:** Deere's operating margins tend to be relatively stable, except during downturns in the business cycle.  However, margins are being squeezed by higher input costs and greater competition, as discussed in 2022 year-end earnings call, stating that while price realization has been positive, it has not kept pace with increases in material and freight costs.  *Competitive pressures may intensify,* which could erode margins, and the company's ability to raise prices is dependent on customer demand.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Deere faces competition from a number of global and regional players, including AGCO, CNH Industrial, Kubota, and others. Deere's competitive position depends on its ability to maintain its premium brand image, leverage its dealer network, and innovate in areas like precision agriculture.
* **Financials:** Deere has a solid balance sheet and generates strong cash flow.  However, its return on invested capital (ROIC) has declined in recent years, suggesting increased competition. *Given the cyclical nature of its business, even conservative intrinsic valuation estimates can be challenging, as noted in Damodaran's "The Little Book of Valuation."*




**Valuation ($37.56 billion):**

We performed a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using a 10-year forecast period and a terminal value:

1. **Forecast:** We assumed a gradual decline in revenue growth from 2% in the near term to 0.5% in the terminal year, reflecting macroeconomic uncertainty and intensifying competition.  We assumed a gradual improvement in margins from a low current rate of 13.5% to 15%, as the company is working to bring down costs.  Capital expenditures are significant but are treated as part of operations because Deere is mostly equity financed, so it typically finances capital expenditures from earnings.


2. **Cost of Capital:** We used a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56 percent, reflecting Deere's moderate financial risk.


3. **Terminal Value:** We used a perpetual growth rate of 0.5 percent and a terminal return on new invested capital (RONIC) of 12 percent to compute a terminal value of $50.19 billion. 


4. **DCF Value:** Discounting the projected free cash flows and terminal value at the WACC yielded a total enterprise value of $44.54 billion.


5. **Other Claims:** Subtracting debt and minority interests and adding back cash and other nonoperating assets yields a total equity value of $37.56 billion. 

*Note:* This valuation is highly sensitive to assumptions about long-term growth and profitability. A more pessimistic outlook would yield a significantly lower valuation.


## Appendix: Detailed Valuation Calculations

**Key Inputs:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Gradually declines from 2% to 0.5%
* **Operating Margin:** Improves from 13.5% to 15%
* **Capital Expenditures:** 8% of Revenues
* **Tax Rate:** 25%
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 7.56%
* **Perpetual Growth Rate:** 0.5%
* **Terminal RONIC:** 12%

**Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projection:**

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Operating Margin (%) | EBIT ($B) | Reinvestment ($B) | FCF ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $47.555 | 13.72% | $6.523 | $3.951 | $2.572 |
| 2 | $48.506 | 13.94% | $6.756 | $4.038 | $2.718 |
| 3 | $49.474 | 14.16% | $6.999 | $4.128 | $2.871 |
| 4 | $50.459 | 14.38% | $7.251 | $4.220 | $3.031 |
| 5 | $51.461 | 14.60% | $7.511 | $4.314 | $3.197 |
| 6 | $52.480 | 14.82% | $7.780 | $4.411 | $3.369 |
| 7 | $53.516 | 15.00% | $8.027 | $4.502 | $3.525 |
| 8 | $54.568 | 15.00% | $8.185 | $4.588 | $3.597 |
| 9 | $55.636 | 15.00% | $8.345 | $4.675 | $3.670 |
| 10 | $56.721 | 15.00% | $8.508 | $4.763 | $3.745 |


**Terminal Value Calculation:**

```
Terminal Value = (After-tax Operating Income in Year 11 * (1 - Reinvestment Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Stable Growth Rate)
Terminal Value = ($8.676 * (1-0.2667)) / (0.0756 - 0.005) = $99.18B 
```

**Present Value of Operating Assets:** Sum of the present values of FCFs from years 1-10 plus the present value of the terminal value. PV is calculated using the following formula: `FCF / (1 + WACC)^year` where year is the respective year for which FCF is calculated. The present values for years 1-10 are given in table 6.3 and the present value of the terminal value is calculated at year 10 to be $49.31B resulting in a total **present value of operating assets of $69.26 Billion**.

**Valuation Adjustments:**

* **Cash and Marketable Securities:** Deere & Company had $7.06 billion in cash in 2022. Since cash is a nonoperating asset, it is valued at book value in an unlevered DCF and not as part of operations. We expect Deere to hoard its cash for acquisitions in the near future and in addition to this, the firm may need more than its status quo unrestricted cash to maintain its present level of sales given the cyclical environment that may reduce cash flows in the downturn years, this may put an end to its stock repurchases. However, it could also allow the management to execute some smart acquisitions if good companies at good prices can be found during this period of pessimism and turmoil.
* **Debt:**  Deere had $43.20 billion in total debt.
* **Minority Interests:**   This is assumed to be negligible.

**Equity Value:**

```
Equity Value = PV of Operating Assets + Cash - Debt
Equity Value = $69.26B + $7.06B - $43.20B = $33.12B
```

**Note:** This valuation does not include the value of any employee stock options or other contingent claims, which may be substantial.


**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Cyclical Business:**  Deere's dependence on the agricultural, construction, and forestry industries makes it vulnerable to cyclical downturns. This is a key source of risk for investors and makes valuation challenging, as discussed throughout both Graham and Damodaran's books. 
* **Competition:** Deere faces increasing competition from both established and new players, especially in precision agriculture. The company's future profitability will depend on its ability to innovate and differentiate its products and services. The company also faces risks to its business model from the emergence of new technologies, such as autonomous driving for tractors and combines. As noted in the 2021 fourth-quarter earnings call, this issue is on the radar of management.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Precision Agriculture:** Deere's success in precision agriculture could drive future growth and improve margins.  However, the competitive landscape is evolving quickly, and Deere faces the risk that these technologies will become commoditized. Management has discussed this at length throughout the company's quarterly earnings calls.
* **Emerging Markets:**  Deere is looking to expand its presence in emerging markets, which could be a significant source of growth in the long term.  However, these markets present a number of challenges, including political and economic uncertainty. Deere & Company has a worldwide presence and its products are sold in more than 160 countries, but its main revenue and earning bases are the United States, Canada, and Europe.  The company also has factories in Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico, Germany, China, Russia, France, South Africa, and several locations in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Italy, and several other countries, but most of its revenues and earnings come from the operations in the United States, Europe, and Canada. However, the company is increasing its presence in countries like China, Brazil, India, and Russia. So, the company is exposed to various risks related to emerging markets, such as currency risk, economic and political risks, and difficulty of doing business.
* **Cost Cutting:**  Deere is implementing cost-cutting measures to improve its profitability. The success of these efforts will be a key driver of its future financial performance. As noted in the 2022 fourth-quarter earnings call, Deere has a target to reduce its cost of sales by 3% and SG&A cost by 2% per year. 

{: .warning }

This analysis assumes that the company maintains a relatively high level of reinvestment in its business and that financial synergies from its most recent large acquisition - Wirtgen - are relatively small.
