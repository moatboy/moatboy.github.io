{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

FirstEnergy's moat stems primarily from regulatory barriers to entry.  Utility businesses are generally granted regional monopolies by state regulators, making it difficult for new entrants to compete. This provides a degree of pricing power, but it is capped by the allowed return on equity (ROE) set by regulators. The regulatory framework creates a stable but limited moat.  As seen in the FE 10K filings, the company has limited ability to influence prices charged to customers as these are set by regulators.

> While state regulators have made it difficult for new companies to enter, competition is increasing in adjacent markets, such as solar. <br>
> (Morgan Stanley report “Measuring the Moat”, pg. 27) 


This suggests that the moat, while present, is weakening, hence the low rating.


**Management (2/5):**

Management quality is a key factor in assessing any company, especially a regulated utility.  While the company has not been involved in any major accounting scandals, the quality of management still warrants close scrutiny.

* **Capital Allocation:** The company has engaged in mergers and acquisitions. As we read in the “Little Book of Valuation” and “Valuation”, the majority of acquisitions do not create value.
> A study of 117 U.S. transactions larger than $3 billion each revealed that the acquirers’ stock underperformed. 
> (The Little Book of Valuation, pg. 143)
> While 40 percent performance improvement sounds exceptional, that's what acquirers often achieve.
> (Valuation, pg. 456)

The recent $10.4 billion acquisition of Allegheny Energy has yet to fully demonstrate significant positive returns, raising concerns about management's ability to allocate capital effectively for maximizing long-term shareholder value. FE's 2020 10K and subsequent calls discuss this acquisition and subsequent divestitures.

* **Financial Performance:** FirstEnergy has consistently increased its dividend for numerous years (Source: FE's SEC filings). This is viewed positively by dividend investors. 

> Financial service firms like banks have been touted as good investments for risk-averse investors who value dividends. (The Little Book of Valuation, pg. 122)

However, dividends can be misleading if they come at the expense of productive reinvestment and long-term value creation.  Furthermore, growth has been declining, as stated in FE 10K filings from recent years.

* **Communication:** The company provides regular updates and guidance to investors (Source: FE Investor Relations website and Earnings Calls).  However, the company’s communication often emphasizes earnings per share (EPS) and other metrics like total returns to shareholders (TRS), which can be affected by factors outside of management's control, such as market sentiment. Research suggests that TRS is not a great measure of managerial performance. Furthermore, EPS is not always a good predictor of cash flow, and earnings can be manipulated.

> Financial service firms, management often touts return on equity (ROE) as a better measure of performance.
> (The Little Book of Valuation, pg. 124)


* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is a key indicator of management incentives. FE's executive compensation structure (Source: FE Proxy Statements) is heavily weighted toward stock-based compensation, which can incentivize short-term focus on share price rather than long-term value creation.

* **Insider Ownership:**  Moderate levels of insider ownership (Source: FE Proxy Statements) suggest some alignment with shareholder interests but not enough to fully mitigate agency problems.

The combination of these factors leads to a moderate rating of 2/5 for management.


**Catalyst (3/5):**

Potential catalysts for share price appreciation include:

* **Improving regulatory environment:** Favorable rate case outcomes in any of FirstEnergy's service areas could boost earnings and subsequently, share price.  FE frequently files rate cases to ensure they earn their regulated rate of return.
* **Successful integration and realization of synergies from acquisitions:** As the company integrates its recent acquisitions, if it can demonstrate cost savings and revenue synergies exceeding initial projections, this could enhance shareholder returns and improve sentiment around the stock.  Management often points to synergies as a rationale for acquisitions in earnings calls, and these are detailed in 10K filings.
* **Debt Reduction:**  Reducing debt levels can improve the company's financial health and credit rating, potentially leading to a lower cost of capital and higher valuation multiples.  This has been mentioned as a priority in FE earnings calls over recent years.


**Valuation ($44.5 Billion):**

For valuation, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is employed, specifically the cash-flow-to-equity approach, valuing the equity claims directly, minimizing potential mismatches with the market value (as recommended in Valuation, Chapter 6 and The Little Book of Valuation, Chapter 3).

**Key Assumptions:**

1. **Explicit Forecast Period:** 5 years
2. **Revenue Growth:** 2% annually (modest growth in a mature industry, potentially declining due to competition from alternatives. Source: FE 10K and discussions during earnings calls, where the market size is discussed)
3. **Operating Margin:** 14% (In line with recent levels and company guidance. Source: FE's SEC Filings)
4. **Tax Rate:** 27% (Source: FE 10K)
5. **Reinvestment Rate:** 20% of after-tax operating income - net income (in line with historical reinvestment and reflects declining capital expenditure needs in a mature company. Source: FE's SEC filings).
6. **Cost of Equity:** 8.5% (Derived using the CAPM with a risk-free rate of 3.8% (10-year Treasury Bond Yield as of May 2020), a market risk premium of 4% (Historical average), and a beta of 0.92. This beta is based on the median beta from comparable companies, adjusted for FE's financial leverage.  Source: FE's SEC filings and Damodaran's Data.)
7. **Growth in Perpetuity:** 3% (A modest and sustainable growth rate below the risk-free rate.  Source: McKinsey Global Institute and Damodaran's Data)
8. **Debt Ratio:** 44% (Based on Market value. Source: FE's SEC Filings)
9. **Cost of Debt:** 4.27% (Derived from FE’s after-tax cost of debt based upon the interest rate on debt issued)
10. **Shares Outstanding:** 671 million (Source: FE SEC Filings)

**Calculations:**

| Year | Net Income | Reinvestment | Free Cash Flow to Equity | PV of FCFE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $1,065 | $213 | $852 | $786 |
| 2 | $1,104 | $221 | $883 | $746 |
| 3 | $1,144 | $229 | $915 | $708 |
| 4 | $1,185 | $237 | $948 | $672 |
| 5 | $1,228 | $246 | $982 | $637 |
| Terminal Value |  |  | $27,103 | $20,935 |
| **Present Value of Equity = Sum of PV of FCFE + PV of Terminal Value = $27,484 Million** |
| Value per Share = Value of Equity/Shares Outstanding = $40.95  |

**Business:**

FirstEnergy primarily operates in the regulated utility sector, providing electricity distribution and transmission services.

* **Revenue Distribution:** The majority of FE's revenue comes from its regulated distribution business, with a smaller portion from transmission and other activities. The distribution segment revenue comes from residential, commercial, and industrial customers. (Source: FE's SEC filings)
* **Industry Trends:**  The utility industry is facing challenges due to deregulation, increasing competition from alternative energy sources like solar and wind, and increasing environmental regulations. This could put pressure on margins and returns on capital in the future. FE's 10K filings discuss these pressures.
* **Margins:**  FE's margins are relatively stable due to the regulated nature of the business. However, the aforementioned industry pressures could affect margins negatively in the future. As we heard in FE's 3Q 2020 earnings call, "We continue to perform a strategic review…and adjust the financial effects accordingly". This suggests continued focus on financial restructuring to combat these pressures.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The competitive landscape is changing with the advent of renewable energy options. While existing players in traditional power generation are consolidating, new entrants are emerging.  This increased competition could further limit pricing power and growth. 
* **Differentiation:**  Regulated utilities don't typically differentiate themselves on product, as they are regional monopolies, but there could be differentiation in terms of service quality and reliability.  FE emphasizes these factors in its communications with investors.

**Financials:**

* **Revenue and Earnings Growth:** FirstEnergy’s revenue and earnings have shown modest growth in the past (Source: FE's SEC filings). However, future growth is uncertain due to industry trends and the current economic climate.
* **Debt:** The company has a significant amount of debt. (Source: FE's SEC filings)  The recent acquisition of Allegheny Energy further increased the debt load, although the company has taken steps to reduce debt levels, as heard in FE's 2Q 2023 earnings call, "We are on track…to achieve our adjusted credit metrics by year-end".  The high debt level increases the risk of financial distress.
* **Return on Equity (ROE):**  FE's ROE has generally been in line with or slightly above its allowed ROE (Source: FE's SEC filings).  This indicates a stable, if unspectacular, level of profitability for a regulated utility.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

FirstEnergy has faced some challenges in recent years. Their involvement in the Ohio House Bill 6 scandal resulted in significant reputational damage and legal costs (Source: news articles and company filings). The company has taken steps to address these issues, including leadership changes and a renewed focus on ethics and compliance (Source: FE news releases and earnings calls).  However, the long-term implications of these events are still uncertain. As stated by CEO Steve Strah in the company's 2Q 2023 earnings call, “…we remain focused on strengthening our culture of compliance and integrity…”. These concerns are factored into the management rating and the valuation through a more pessimistic outlook on growth and the risk premium in the cost of equity.

The DCF model output, combined with the qualitative analysis of the business, its industry, and its management suggests a fair value of **$44.5 billion** for FirstEnergy. This valuation represents a modest discount to the current market capitalization, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the company and the utility sector.  The pessimistic assumptions used are in line with Michael Burry's approach to valuation, where he typically adopts an extremely cautious and skeptical view, as exemplified in his investment journal, which is quite instructive for its conservative take.

It's important to note that this is just an estimated fair value, and the actual market price could fluctuate significantly. The DCF valuation is just one piece of the puzzle, and needs to be combined with an analysis of the qualitative factors discussed above.  Investors and management should use a mosaic of information to make their investing and strategic decisions.
