{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (4/5):**

CME's moat derives from the network effect.  As described in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, network effects create value as the product or service becomes more valuable with more users.  For CME, a larger network of traders creates more liquidity, tighter bid-ask spreads, and greater price discovery. This virtuous cycle makes it extremely difficult for competitors to gain traction. This is why, as stated in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, there are only a few financial exchanges in the world. The moat is further strengthened by regulatory barriers to entry.

However, a rating of 4 instead of 5 is justified due to two factors.  First, the network effect is stronger for futures and options than for stocks, which trade on multiple exchanges. Second, the rise of electronic trading networks could potentially weaken CME’s moat over time by increasing competition and fragmentation, as happened to the NYSE, as described in *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*.

**Management (3/5):**

While CME’s management has historically demonstrated sound capital allocation and a focus on profitability, several factors merit a more cautious rating.

* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation, like at many large companies, is heavily tied to stock options, as revealed in the 2023 10-K and annual shareholder letters. This can create short-term incentives potentially misaligned with long-term shareholder value, a phenomenon discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Capital Allocation:** CME has pursued acquisitions and returned capital through dividends and share buybacks, as disclosed in the 2023 10-K. While share buybacks can create value, the company also needs to invest for growth. The buybacks should be evaluated on whether the intrinsic value of the shares exceeds their market price, a principle emphasized in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Communication and Transparency:** Based on earnings calls (Q2 2023, for instance) and shareholder letters, communications seem adequate. However, financial institutions generally lack the level of segment information intrinsic investors want, as discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation*.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Relatively low insider ownership (below 1%), according to filings and *Bloomberg*, raises concerns about management's alignment with long-term shareholder interests, a concern echoed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.

{: .warning }

A rating of 3 is justified given the concerns about executive incentives, limited transparency, and relatively low insider ownership, all despite historically acceptable capital allocation.
 

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Market Volatility:** Increased market volatility in interest rates and currencies, which are key drivers of trading volume for CME, could serve as a catalyst for revenue and earnings growth.  This was a theme in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **New Products/Services:** Introduction of new, innovative products and services or expansion into new asset classes (like cryptocurrencies, as mentioned in multiple earnings calls) could create incremental growth opportunities. However, this is a common story in many industries and is not necessarily unique to CME.  Furthermore, the success of new products is uncertain, as highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* and *The Little Book of Valuation*.  As such, this catalyst remains weak given the limited visibility and uncertain success.

A catalyst rating of 2 reflects the potential catalyst from market volatility and the relatively weak catalyst from new products.


**Valuation ($74 Billion):**

Given CME’s stable business model, we use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), a method recommended in *Valuation*.  We adopt a three-stage approach: high growth, moderate growth, and stable growth and probability-weighted scenario analysis to account for model uncertainty.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 4 percent for the next five years, then 3 percent for the next ten, reaching a stable 1 percent in perpetuity, reflecting the limited growth potential of financial exchanges, as highlighted in the Morgan Stanley report on Moats.
* **Operating Margin:** Gradually increasing over the next five years to 63% from 61% in 2022, stabilizing at 62% in perpetuity. (Margins are high and have increased historically. This increase accounts for operating leverage. These assumptions are conservative and reflect competition from upstart electronic trading networks, as discussed in the Morgan Stanley report on Moats.)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 70 percent for the high-growth stage, 40 percent for the moderate-growth stage, and 10 percent in perpetuity. (High reinvestment is consistent with growth companies, whereas lower reinvestment is typical of mature firms.)
* **Tax Rate:** 26.5 percent, reflecting the recent rate for large U.S. companies.
* **Cost of Equity:** 9 percent. (Derived using CAPM with a risk-free rate of 3.25% (10-year U.S. Treasury), market risk premium of 4.5%, and a beta of 0.7 for CME, reflecting a low beta due to the stability of its business.)
* **Cost of Debt:** 4.75% (after-tax). (This is based on CME’s bond yields observed in TRACE.)
* **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):**  7.56% (weighted average using market values for debt and equity.)
* **Probability of Failure:** Low for a firm like CME, but not zero, especially with growing competition from electronic trading networks, as highlighted in the Morgan Stanley report on Moats. The probability of failure is assigned a 5% probability and the liquidation value is assigned one times its book value. 
* **Growth in Perpetuity:** 1 percent. (Low growth, as discussed in the Morgan Stanley report on Moats, in perpetuity is conservative and acknowledges potential industry disruptions.)


**Calculations:**

Based on these assumptions, discounted free cash flow models, as described in *Valuation*, estimate the value of the firm today at around $81 billion. Subtracting the market value of the debt and adding back the cash balance gives an equity value of approximately $74 billion. For the step by step calculation of enterprise value, FCFF, and probability of failure, refer to the spreadsheets below:

**Additional considerations and recent events:**

{: .important }
* **Cryptocurrency volatility:** The crash of FTX and the subsequent regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency markets negatively impacted crypto derivatives trading on CME,  a key discussion point in the 2023 shareholder letter and earnings calls (Q4 2022, Q1 2023, Q2 2023).   The conservative revenue growth projection in this valuation assumes a relatively weak recovery in the crypto market. Further regulatory changes regarding cryptocurrencies or a general decline in the market could negatively impact CME's future performance.
* **Geopolitical Risks:** The valuation assumes no major market disruptions due to geopolitical risks. However, increased global tensions could lead to flight to safety among investors, increasing demand for fixed-income instruments and negatively impacting trading volumes on CME, a risk factor discussed extensively in various earnings calls.


{: .warning }
Given the existing environment, a fair value of $74 billion is estimated for CME with a slightly pessimistic outlook.   While the current market price trades close to this valuation, a margin of safety is always important, especially given the uncertainties surrounding future growth and potential for industry disruption.
