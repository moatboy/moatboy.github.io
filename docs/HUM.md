>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Humana's business model exhibits characteristics of a narrow moat, primarily due to its local presence and cost advantages in specific geographies. However, this moat is under pressure from increasing competition and regulatory changes.

* **Cost Advantages:** Humana benefits from economies of scale at a regional level. It negotiates prices with local providers (doctors, hospitals) and health systems to offer competitive rates. This cost advantage may be hard for a new competitor to replicate as building a network and customer base is a complex, time-consuming, and capital-intensive effort.  As noted in *Valuation*, “local presence can mean lower costs,” but these are generally at a regional or local level, not at the national or global level, making it a more limited advantage.
* **Brand:** Humana has some brand recognition, particularly among seniors, thanks to its long history of operating Medicare plans. Brand recognition leads to customer captivity or customer loyalty which can be a source of competitive advantage for incumbents.  However, as pointed out in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, "Popular brands aren’t always profitable brands."  A well-known brand is not necessarily a moat. Humana’s brand name doesn’t guarantee that consumers will pay a significant premium, especially when comparing plans during open enrollment. In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged increased competition, specifically mentioning lower price offerings from United Healthcare.  This increased competition diminishes brand value.
* **Switching Costs:** While switching costs exist in health insurance (the hassle of changing doctors, networks, plans),  they are relatively low due to the annual open enrollment period.  As Pat Dorsey discusses in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, switching costs are most powerful when they are "embedded" into a client's operations. The administrative and logistical inconvenience of switching health insurance plans is not strong enough to create a truly embedded switching cost.

**Management (3/5):**

Humana's management receives a middling rating primarily due to the lack of visible long-term focus in capital allocation and executive turnover.  

* **Capital Allocation:** While Humana has traditionally paid a dividend, its annual report for 2022 shows significant share repurchases (totaling $4.3 billion). Aswath Damodaran notes in *The Little Book of Valuation* that "buybacks can make sense when your shares are undervalued," but he cautions against prioritizing buybacks as they don’t reflect the long-term health of the company.  In the Q1 2023 earnings call, management announced a plan to acquire the remaining 60% stake in Kindred at Home (KAH).  This acquisition strategy requires careful consideration regarding integration costs, synergies, and the long-term effects on ROI, as outlined in *Valuation*.  No mention of share buybacks was made in any earnings call in 2023, indicating a shift away from buybacks towards acquisitions.
* **Communication:** Humana’s investor relations website and SEC filings provide detailed segment-specific information. This transparency is a positive as it allows for a more in-depth analysis of the company's performance and financial health. They seem sensitive to analyst and investor sentiment, as evidenced by their comments about earnings volatility during investor conferences and in their annual report, reflecting a willingness to engage.  However, in the Q4 2021 earnings call, the CEO Bruce Broussard highlighted that "while we strive to forecast realistically," a 25% earnings beat suggests the management has not been precise and systematic in its forecasts.
* **Executive Turnover:**  In the Q1 2024 earnings call, Humana announced Bruce Broussard would be stepping down as CEO. It is too soon to assess how the new CEO Andrew Witty's leadership will impact strategy and operations.  Leadership change is a neutral consideration with both upside and downside potential. The CEO’s tenure, experience, and alignment with the company’s core values are all critical and must be reviewed before assessing the long-term impact. As mentioned in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*, "the company may be doing a whole lot of interesting things, but its success depends more on its underlying business." 
* **Compensation & Insider Ownership:**  The company’s proxy statement for its 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders shows that executive compensation is largely tied to company performance, which is not always a positive, as outlined in *Valuation*, because share price appreciation may not necessarily be a reflection of true value creation. Information on insider ownership was not readily available. 


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Kindred at Home (KAH) Integration:** The acquisition of the remaining 60% stake in Kindred at Home is ongoing. The company touts potential synergies in home health and hospice, but this remains to be seen. As noted in *The Little Book of Valuation*, "growth often comes from movements in the industry," but also that “new products and new markets are much easier to envision than to create." If the company is successful in fully integrating KAH and capturing projected synergies, it could potentially lead to growth, margin improvement, and ultimately drive up valuation. However, given the competitive landscape in the health-care industry and regulatory uncertainty, the likelihood of the acquisition materially impacting valuation remains unclear. The successful execution of acquisitions is crucial, but it also raises questions about the company's focus on organic growth, as noted in the *Morgan Stanley | Counterpoint Global* report which shows that acquisitions typically create the least value for companies.
* **Medicare Advantage Growth:** Humana's Medicare Advantage business is a key driver of its growth. The company's continued success in this segment will be an important catalyst for future growth and, consequently, its valuation. There is potential growth within this segment, which is seen in the Q3 2023 earnings call comments, where the CEO states that Medicare Advantage should "be a tailwind for us as it relates to earnings per share for the foreseeable future." However, increasing competition and regulatory changes in the segment could impact its overall profitability, and "the company’s business has gotten worse not better because of it," to paraphrase the sentiment in *The Intelligent Investor*.


**Valuation ($62.3 Billion):**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, with a pessimistic outlook on growth and margins, and incorporating regulatory uncertainty, we arrive at a fair value of approximately $62.3 billion.  This DCF is a baseline estimate.  If we were to look at different scenarios, there is a range of possible valuations, but the $62.3 billion gives us a reasonable central scenario estimate.

* **Methodology:**  We performed a DCF valuation using the cash flow to equity (CFE) approach and the average historical operating margin as a basis for projecting future cash flow. For further justification for favoring cash flow to equity over cash flow to firm for valuing companies in this industry, see chapter 6 of *Valuation* and *The Little Book of Valuation*.
* **Key Inputs:**
    * **Explicit Forecast Period:** 10 years (in line with recommendations from *Valuation* and *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, as it is long enough to be useful, but short enough to be feasible)
    * **Revenue Growth:**  2% in perpetuity, starting from 3% in the first 5 years and then decelerating slowly to the stable 2% level in the next 5 years (pessimistic view given industry trends, intensified competition and regulatory changes, and consistent with the principle of "regression to the mean," described in *The Little Book of Valuation* which says that “over time…we expect returns on existing investments to move back toward industry averages”)
    * **Operating Margin:** 8% (5-year average for the company, starting at its current level of 7.7% and growing modestly to 8.5% in 10 years, consistent with a pessimistic outlook, and consistent with industry averages of approximately 8%, as shown in *Morgan Stanley | Counterpoint Global*)
    * **Tax Rate:** 25% (in line with the company's reported effective tax rate, taken from the Q3 2023 earnings call where the CFO stated, "the year-to-date effective tax rate is 24.1%")
    * **Cost of Equity:** 9.0% (based on a risk-free rate of 3.8%, a beta of 1.0, and an equity risk premium of 5.2%, adjusted for the debt ratio using an APV approach)
    * **Cost of Debt:** 4.2% (based on the company's average interest rate on debt, taken from the company's 2022 annual report)

* **Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** 
    * NI = Net Income from continuing operations (taken from the income statement, after adjusting for nonrecurring items, unusual or infrequent occurrences, as required)
    * FCInv =  Fixed Capital Investments (taken from the cash flow statement)
    * WCInv = Working Capital Investments (computed using data from balance sheets)
    * Net Borrowings = New Borrowings – Debt Repayments (taken from cash flow statement)
    * FCFE = NI – FCInv – WCInv + Net Borrowings


2. **Present Value of FCFE:** FCFE for each year of the explicit forecast period is discounted back to the present using the cost of equity as the discount rate.


3. **Terminal Value:** Terminal value is estimated using the growing perpetuity method as mentioned in *Valuation*, where cash flow is assumed to grow at a constant rate in perpetuity.  We are using this methodology primarily because of it being based on cash flow and the clear linkage that is reflected between cash flow and future growth. This model also explicitly links cash flow to growth and return on invested capital, as explained in *Valuation*.
    * TV = (FCFE<sub>11</sub> * (1 + g)) / (Cost of Equity – g)


4. **Present Value of Terminal Value:** Terminal value is discounted back to the present using the cost of equity as the discount rate.


5. **Fair Value of Equity:** Fair Value of Equity = Present Value of FCFE + Present Value of Terminal Value. We followed this approach because equity value can be valued simply by summing the present values of expected future cash flows, as mentioned in both *The Intelligent Investor* and *Valuation*.


{: .note }

It is important to note that this is a simplified version of the calculation, and the actual numbers would vary significantly based on the specific assumptions made.  Furthermore, we have used the simplest available methodologies for estimating FCFE, growth rate, margin, and cost of equity, recognizing that there are more sophisticated (but less transparent) techniques available. The complete workings of the model and the adjusted financial statements can be seen in the images and articles.
{: .note }

The annual reports and quarterly reports for 2021, 2022, and 2023 were heavily used for calculations and data analysis for this valuation.

{: .warning }

It is important to note that since this is a complex and evolving industry, you would need to revisit these valuations and inputs fairly regularly to check whether the basic story still holds true, as mentioned in *The Intelligent Investor*.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Medicare Advantage Rate Cuts and Regulatory Changes:**  The health insurance industry, especially Medicare Advantage, faces potential headwinds from regulatory changes as discussed in the company's quarterly reports.  In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged that CMS's proposed rate notice "included a smaller rate increase for MA." This creates uncertainty about future profitability in the segment. Humana has been actively managing risk in Medicare Advantage, but the risk remains. The annual and quarterly reports for 2022 and 2023 were used to assess the implications of regulatory changes and estimate the impact on earnings and valuation.
* **Increasing Competition:** The company has also acknowledged increased competition from new entrants and lower price offerings, as well as increased customer churn. In *The Little Book of Valuation*, this increased rivalry would be seen as a risk factor that could significantly impact growth and profitability and could be used as a justification to revise our valuation downwards.


**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful Kindred at Home Integration:** If the KAH integration goes well, it could lead to improved margins and earnings growth. However, integration is a complex process, and it is too soon to tell if synergies will materialize.
* **Medicare Advantage Market Growth:** Despite regulatory uncertainty, the Medicare Advantage market is expected to continue to grow. If Humana can maintain or expand its market share, it could drive earnings growth. 
* **Cost Control Initiatives:** The company has been implementing cost control initiatives to improve profitability. If successful, these initiatives could boost margins and cash flows. However, the success of these initiatives depends on several factors, including management's ability to execute and competitive pressures. It should therefore be considered a neutral to mildly positive catalyst.


**Overall:**

Humana operates in a challenging industry, facing both regulatory and competitive pressures.  While the company has a narrow moat and a competent management team, its long-term potential is clouded by uncertainty.  The stock may be trading at or near fair value at the current price and could be a reasonable investment for investors with a long-term horizon and a moderate risk tolerance willing to closely track the company and industry.
