### Moat Analysis: 2 / 5
{: .important }
STVN’s economic moat is **narrow** and is primarily driven by a combination of factors. They have a relatively strong moat based on switching costs, their scale and proprietary production technology. They do have a decent level of intangible assets, and some network effects, but their impacts are small, making their moat not wide.

*   **Intangible Assets (Brands, Patents, Regulatory Licenses):**  They have a few intangible assets that give them an advantage, such as specialized glass manufacturing techniques that are not easily replicated, but have nothing that significantly limits competition in a broad sense.
    * The brand is not too strong and would not be a large source of revenue if competitors are able to produce similar products.
    *  Patent protection is limited to some very specific technologies, and is not enough to stop other players from competing.
    * They do however, benefit from having a regulatory approval, but this is mainly from the manufacturing process, and is not related to the pricing or product features, so it does not generate any pricing power.
*   **Switching Costs:** Switching costs are moderate. Because their product offerings are complex and heavily integrated in the supply chain, customer switching is costly, but not impossible. Customers often prefer stability, so this limits competition.
*   **Network Effects:** There’s limited network effect, but the business tends to become more attractive for buyers when there is a large supply of production capabilities. This also helps lock-in new customers.
*   **Cost Advantage:** Although the company has a global operation and production facilities, they do not have any specific cost advantages over competitors, they do not rely on location, scale or proprietary materials.
   * They do try and optimize their supply chain to limit and control costs.

**Risks to the Moat and Business:**

*   **Technological Disruption:** A major risk is technological disruption in materials science and production. New materials or new production methods may make STVN's proprietary technology obsolete. For example, new plastics, new types of coatings, or new types of drug delivery may emerge and render some of the current processes redundant.
*   **Intensifying Competition:** Increased competition, especially from Chinese and other low-cost manufacturers, could lead to lower prices, a price war, and reduced margins, eroding overall profitability.
*    **Regulatory Changes:** The industry is highly regulated and future regulatory changes could affect the cost and ease of doing business.
*   **Dependency on Key Customers:** STVN has long contracts with pharmaceutical companies which gives them reliability, but loss of, or a major changes, in these contracts may negatively affect future results.
*   **Currency Fluctuations:** As a global company, they are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. This can affect profitability, especially when raw materials prices are fixed at a specific currency.
*   **Supply Chain Issues**: The company is also susceptible to supply chain disruptions, material shortages, or quality problems. 
    *  The war in Ukraine has caused problems for some of their suppliers. The company needs to keep finding new suppliers to ensure future production isn't slowed down.
*  **Economic Downturns** In the event of a recession or a global economic downturn, sales from the engineering division might fall with reduced capital expenditures from manufacturers.

**Business Resilience:**
Stevanato has shown resilience over time and also shown the ability to adapt to changes, specifically in the last few years with the pandemic and recent supply chain challenges. A major factor in its resilience is the high quality and safety standards, making it difficult for customers to switch to other companies. Also, they operate in a necessity industry, since they cater to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries which rely on their products. The company also has been diversifying their supply chain and markets, reducing exposure to a single economic factor or a specific country, which is also good from a risk perspective.

### Understandability: 3 / 5
The company has a decent understandability for a normal investor with a financial background. It helps that the basic products sold by the company are fairly straightforward (packaging for drugs) - as opposed to very complex business models.

*   The company sells glass containers for pharmaceutical applications and equipment, both of which are relatively simple and readily understandable.
*    However, the complexity lies in the technical specifications of the glass products and the regulatory environment of pharmaceutical and medical devices. These can add an extra layer of complexity for those without prior experience in the industry.
*    The engineering and automation components can also be tricky to understand because they involve several types of technical expertise.
*    The company provides a good explanation of their core financial drivers in their filings.
*  The company's financial reports and earnings presentations can be overwhelming for the casual investor.

### Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5
The balance sheet of STVN shows moderate health with a good level of equity, and a manageable amount of debt. The company is cash flow positive, and has adequate liquid assets to cover debt obligations. The risks associated with their balance sheet aren’t too severe to threaten the company's survival, however, a large portion of their assets are in intangible ones such as goodwill, and some of their liabilities are from deferred taxes, which can be hard to estimate. Overall, the balance sheet is in a good, but not perfect, shape.

*  **Debt:** The total debt of EUR 1.0 billion is manageable compared to its total assets. The short-term nature of the debt is somewhat concerning, but the company has generated a positive cash flow, which would allow for paying off those debts without issue.
*  **Cash:** The cash level is around EUR 200 million which is more than enough for its operational and financial needs.
*  **Equity:** Equity is stable and makes up the majority of the total liabilities and equity, suggesting that they have a sound base and aren’t overleveraged.

## conclusion
STVN is a specialized supplier for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with a narrow moat stemming from high switching costs, proprietary technology, and scale benefits. Their financials are positive and growing, and the company has been dealing with its financial obligations carefully. However, the business is susceptible to disruption and economic cycles, especially with rising competition in the industry.
