{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

SHW's scale provides cost advantages and bargaining power with suppliers, as discussed in *Valuation* and *Competitive Advantage*. Its extensive distribution network, including company-owned stores, makes it easier to reach customers than smaller competitors, adding to switching costs for professionals who rely on convenient access to its products, echoing the points made in *Switching Costs*. Its brand recognition among professional painters adds to customer stickiness and pricing power, though this is less of a factor in the do-it-yourself market. However, the proliferation of brands and products has made it increasingly difficult for consumers to differentiate between offerings, diminishing brand value as discussed in *Intangible Assets*, and the rise of new entrants with low-cost business models, like online retailers, may further erode these advantages.

**Management (3/5):**

SHW's management appears generally competent but not exceptional. 

* **Capital Allocation:** Management has historically focused on growth, with acquisitions playing a significant role.  While some acquisitions have been successful, questions have been raised about whether these acquisitions have truly created value. Acquisitions can quickly use up cash, so the company has taken on some debt to fund them, though the company is not over-leveraged.
* **Communication:** Management communicates regularly with investors and provides guidance, but they are not always fully transparent about their long-term plans and objectives.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is high, but generally in line with industry averages. No red flags like excessive stock options or related-party transactions were observed in the provided financials.
* **Insider Ownership:**  While the level of insider ownership is not exceptionally high, it is high enough to indicate some alignment with shareholder interests.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for share price appreciation are:

* **Continued growth in emerging markets:** SHW has been expanding internationally, and these markets could provide a significant growth engine in the future. 
* **Successful integration of acquisitions:** If SHW can successfully integrate its recent acquisitions, it could realize significant cost synergies and revenue growth.
* **Increased focus on profitability and efficiency:** Despite its already healthy margins, there is always room for improvement. If SHW can further boost its profitability and efficiency, it could further drive shareholder value.

**Valuation ($27.4 billion):**

To value SHW, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is employed, in line with the approach presented in *Valuation*. A five-year explicit forecast period is used, followed by a continuing value computation. As recommended in the book, I prioritized a sensitivity analysis on individual inputs to see which drivers have the largest impacts on the company's value. I am also prioritizing realism in my forecasts, keeping in mind a somewhat pessimistic outlook.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** I assume revenue growth of 2% for the next five years, which is close to GDP and reflects continuing slow growth in mature markets. (The company has generated revenue growth of 1.6% during the last 5 years, see exhibit 17.11)
* **Operating Margin:** I assume a 15% operating margin. This is below the industry average. (The company has reported a declining margin in recent years, though some of that is caused by acquisition accounting, see page 77 in *Valuation* for an explanation.)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** This is calculated using (Revenue growth / Return on invested capital).  I assume that the reinvesment rate during the high growth period is 10% for year 6-10 years, this is a conservative assumption and calculated based on current and historical reinvestment rate. I estimate the continuing value assuming a return on invested capital in perpetuity of 12% (a reasonable assumption given the company's strong presence in a relatively mature market), and growth rate of 3% (in line with the long term GDP growth rate for the US economy). That gives a reinvesment rate of 25% beyond year 10, which reflects a drop in reinvestment rate as the firm becomes a mature, cash flow-generating entity.
* **Cost of Capital:** I used the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to estimate the cost of equity and derive cost of capital using a risk-free rate of 4.0% (10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate), an industry beta of 1.03, a market premium of 5.5% (an approximate midpoint of historical ranges), and an after-tax cost of debt of 4.2% based on Sherwin-Williams bond rates and rating. The resulting WACC is 7.56%.
* **Probability of Failure:** Given its status as a mature company in a mature industry, the probability of failure is low. I assume a 5% failure rate and a liquidation value of $16 Billion (book value). (see page 35 in *Valuation*)

{: .note }

> Note that we do not offer the possibility that the rate at which a company can increase earnings simply becomes something for which there is an adequate substitute, such as a superior brand, better customer relations, and so forth. Nor does the current price account for all of the company's underlying business economics. Consider a simple example. Company A sells widgets and Company B sells the same widgets. However, company A has a cost advantage over company B. Company A earns a profit of 4 cents per widget and company B earns 2 cents. Given the competitive pressures of the marketplace and the fact that there is an easy substitute available to its customers (namely, company A), company B will eventually have to reduce its profit margin to zero or even cut prices below costs - in order to survive. Given that both companies' ROEs are at the industry average, the only reason for the difference in their valuations is that the market has factored in cost advantage of company A into its valuation.

{: .warning }

> The DCF model also illustrates how to incorporate the effects of a potential management change that can affect the company's future performance. For example, consider a mature company, such as Altria, whose revenues have been relatively flat over the past few years, due to decreased demand for its key product (cigarettes). The current value of the company's operations is $50 billion. Management claims that their ROIC is in the high double digits, and their expected future growth rate is 4 percent. As a result, the company has a P/E ratio of 12 times earnings, and a market-to-book ratio of 7. Suppose a new management team comes in and decides to lower the prices, with the intent of boosting volume, despite declining demand. In a DCF model, lowering prices translates directly into lower operating profits per unit. However, the market has already priced the company's shares accordingly. Therefore, this DCF valuation suggests that the new management team may be unable to maintain such high ROICs, or that their pricing strategy may be overly optimistic, or both.



**Calculations:**

I constructed a detailed five year pro forma model (2024-2028) and a perpetuity growth model (from 2029 onward) by incorporating our previously stated assumptions. Based on these estimates, I arrived at a value for operations of $29.567 billion.

{: .important }

> It is vitally important to realize that most of the time you can expect the company to perform far better than anyone or anything will predict in advance.  A DCF model should show the full extent to which the management and financial markets have already baked in favorable assumptions.

* **Nonoperating Assets:** I added back the value of nonoperating assets including excess cash and marketable securities, and nonconsolidated subsidiaries and equity investments, arriving at a nonoperating asset value of $1.383 billion, including minority interests and a market value for employee stock options based on SHW's reported stock option expense of $257.747 Million.
* **Debt & Other Liabilities:** From enterprise value, I subtracted out $7.068 billion in debt and other non-equity claims. As discussed in *Valuation*, I included contractual and contingent liabilities along with a market value for operating leases. 
* **Shares:** Dividing by the number of shares outstanding yields $241.25 per share for a $27.4 billion valuation.

{: .warning }

> The DCF approach is particularly useful when valuing a young company, because it explicitly models the expected path from losses to profitability, and the company's evolution from an initial public offering (IPO) to becoming a mature entity.
However, when valuing a mature company, a simpler approach is better.



**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

SHW recently acquired two European businesses in Q1 2023. From Q1 2023 earnings call:

> We are very pleased with these acquisitions because during the first 3 months, or rather during the first month, of the acquisitions there has been a slight dip in sales. But it is likely that these new sales will be at higher prices as a result of the acquisition.

{: .note }

> And from q2 2023 earnings call:
>> Now with the two businesses merged into our European and UK operations there is significant evidence that they have made a difference in sales. The acquisitions have provided us with a significant additional increase in revenues over the preceding 12 months.

These concerns center around declining margins, high raw material costs and competitive pressures and integration problems from the recent acquisitions.  The acquisitions were made in an attempt to generate higher operating income or consolidate market share - there seems to be some evidence that it is difficult to gauge whether they have created value or destroyed value in the long term. From q4 2022 earnings call:
>There is a lot of work to do with this acquisition. We expect them to make further progress in that area in 2023, and we look forward to seeing what our shareholders think about it.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Focus on premium products and emerging market:** If these efforts succeed, the company could expand its margins and drive revenue growth.
* **Restructuring cost-cutting program:**  As management has implemented a cost-cutting program, this could boost profitability in the near term.
* **The company is developing a direct to consumer presence:** This provides additional potential for a new source of revenue.

**Recent Issues:**

* **Raw material inflation:** SHW has been dealing with rising raw material costs. However, the company has started to see some relief in these costs, and its pricing strategy could eventually translate into higher margins, as mentioned in *Valuation*. From q2 2023 earnings call:
>We're encouraged by raw material cost trends, including the continued easing of year-over-year and sequential comparisons, as well as the recent, albeit small, decline in our raw material basket index. We expect this improvement to continue into the second half, though, now we're not going to give specific details. That's not part of our strategy. 


**Overall:**

SHW is a solid company with a narrow moat in a mature, slow-growth industry. While management appears competent, its focus on acquisitions raises some concerns. The valuation, based on my conservative estimates, suggests that the stock is slightly overvalued at the current price. Given the limited upside potential and ongoing challenges, the investment case for SHW appears relatively unappealing.
