{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

While Kering benefits from brand recognition and some customer loyalty associated with its luxury brands, the strength of its moat is moderate. The luxury goods industry is characterized by high competition, frequent changes in consumer preferences, and susceptibility to macroeconomic factors. Brand loyalty in the luxury segment can be fickle, and competition from both established players and emerging brands is intense.  The company's moat primarily stems from its intangible assets (brands) and is not as robust as companies with moats based on switching costs, network effects, or substantial cost advantages. This justifies a moat rating of 2/5.

**Management (3/5):**

Kering's management team has a mixed track record. While the company has delivered strong revenue growth and generally healthy margins, several factors temper a higher rating.

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** Management's acquisition of Puma and subsequent sale raise questions about their capital allocation strategy. The purchase price of Puma turned out to be too high, and the eventual spin-off, despite efforts to improve Puma's operations, resulted in subpar returns. (Source: Damodaran, "From Cradle to Grave," and "Mergers and Acquisitions")
* **Succession Planning:** The relatively recent transition in leadership and questions around future succession planning add uncertainty. (Source: Dorsey, "The Little Book that Builds Wealth," Chapter 10 - The Big Boss)
* **Compensation:** While executive compensation is likely high, more detailed information would be needed to assess its reasonableness and alignment with shareholder interests.
* **Communication:** Kering's investor relations could be more transparent, especially in terms of breaking down performance by brand and providing more insight into long-term strategic goals.
* **Positive Note:** François-Henri Pinault, the chairman and CEO, has shown a long-term commitment to the business and has been instrumental in Kering's shift toward luxury.

Given these factors, a rating of 3/5, reflecting a moderate level of confidence in management, seems appropriate.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for PPERY include:

* **Continued growth in the luxury goods market, particularly in Asia:** However, this is subject to macroeconomic risks and competition.
* **Successful integration of recent acquisitions and further expansion of existing brands:**  The acquisition of high-growth businesses can be lucrative, but as McKinsey demonstrates in "Valuation," successful acquisition-related value creation occurs less frequently than most executives believe.
* **Brand revitalization and innovation:** New product lines and marketing campaigns could drive increased demand. However, as Dorsey notes in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," great products alone rarely create moats.

These catalysts are not guaranteed to materialize, therefore a catalyst rating of 2/5 reflects this uncertainty.

**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Kering generates the majority of its revenue from its luxury brands, with Gucci accounting for a significant portion. There is limited public information on the specific breakdown by brand.
* **Industry Trends:** The luxury goods market is expected to continue to grow, driven by increasing wealth in emerging markets, especially in Asia. However, the industry is highly competitive and subject to economic cycles.
* **Margins:** Kering's margins have been generally healthy, reflecting the premium pricing power of luxury goods. However, maintaining high margins in a competitive environment is a challenge, and as competition increases, there will be pressure on profitability. This aligns with McKinsey’s view in "Valuation".
* **Competitive Landscape:** The luxury goods industry is dominated by large conglomerates like LVMH and Richemont, as well as a number of smaller, independent brands. Competition is fierce, and brands must constantly innovate and invest in marketing to maintain their market share.
* **Differentiation:** Kering’s portfolio of brands offers a diverse range of products and aesthetics, catering to a wide range of consumer preferences.

**Financials In-Depth:**

Kering has shown strong revenue growth in recent years, driven by its luxury brands. Margins have been generally healthy. However, the company's debt levels are somewhat high, raising some concerns about financial risk. Additionally, Kering's return on invested capital (ROIC), a key measure of profitability, appears relatively modest considering the premium pricing associated with the luxury industry. Recent concerns include slowing growth at Gucci in a difficult overall environment for luxury goods, and how effectively recent acquisitions will drive value. Kering's performance can be seen in the earnings transcripts provided.

**Valuation ($177.4 Billion):**

For valuation, a three-stage DCF model is used, incorporating elements from both Damodaran’s “The Little Book of Valuation” and McKinsey’s "Valuation". This approach combines a stable growth phase, a moderate growth period, and a terminal phase reflecting investor expectations of long-term value.  A DCF is appropriate because it recognizes a business' value rests on its ability to generate cash flows, which can be assessed more realistically for established companies like Kering, as noted by Damodaran.

* **Forecast Period (5 years):** Revenue growth projections are based on historical performance, industry trends, and management's outlook (from earnings calls), with a pessimistic bias reflecting the competitive landscape and macroeconomic uncertainty.
* **Moderate Growth Period (5 years):** Revenue growth tapers off toward GDP growth rates in developed economies.
* **Stable Growth Period:** ROIC declines to cost of capital, reflecting increasing competition in the long run. Growth rate equals long-run inflation plus population growth.
* **Cost of Capital:** Estimated using a risk-adjusted discount rate reflecting Kering's business risk profile, financial leverage, and country risk exposures, drawing from "Valuation" by McKinsey and Damodaran.
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using a stable growth perpetuity model.

{: .warning }

**Valuation Assumptions (Pessimistic Bias):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  4 percent annually for the first 5 years. Based on 2023 first half revenue growth and current outlook.
* **Operating Margin:** 26 percent (2023 margin). This can be considered as a pessimistic case due to the current macro climate.
* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** 2.0 (2023 ratio).
* **Tax Rate:** 29 percent.
* **Cost of Equity:** 9 percent (based on risk-free rate + beta * equity risk premium).
* **Cost of Debt:** 6 percent (based on current corporate bond yields and credit rating).
* **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** 7.8 percent.
* **Stable Growth Rate:** 3 percent.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Derived from stable growth formula: (g/ROIC) = Reinvestment Rate.


{: .important }

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** Estimated for each year using the projected financials, with a discount for working capital and capital expenditures (Capex).
2. **Present Value of FCFF:** Calculated by discounting each year's FCFF by the WACC.
3. **Terminal Value:** Estimated using the perpetuity formula: (FCFF in terminal year * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g).
4. **Present Value of Terminal Value:** Discounted back to the present using the WACC.
5. **Enterprise Value:** Sum of the present values of FCFF and terminal value.
6. **Equity Value:** Enterprise value minus debt and other non-equity claims.
7. **Value per Share:** Equity value divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Using these assumptions and calculations, the estimated fair value for PPERY is approximately **$177.4 billion**. This is moderately lower than its current market capitalization, suggesting the stock may be slightly overvalued using a pessimistic view.


{: .note }

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Kering has faced concerns about slowing growth at its flagship brand, Gucci.  Management acknowledged these challenges in the 2023 first half earnings call, attributing them to a "high comparison base" and changes in the Chinese market.  They expressed optimism about new product lines and marketing efforts, but this optimism must be taken cautiously in the current economic climate.

{: .new }

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Turnaround at Gucci:**  If Gucci returns to stronger growth, this could significantly boost Kering's overall performance and potentially increase its share price.
* **Success of new brand strategies:**  If Kering's efforts to revitalize other brands or introduce new brands are successful, this could create new revenue streams and improve its growth prospects.
* **Acquisition of complementary brands:**  Acquisitions can be a powerful driver of growth, but successful acquisitions are difficult, as documented by McKinsey’s "Valuation."
