**Business Overview and Moat Analysis**

Merck faces intense competition, particularly from other large pharmaceutical firms with significant R&D capabilities.  Product patents provide a temporary window of competitive advantage, allowing for premium pricing for new drugs. However, patent expiration generally leads to a rapid and significant decrease in sales as generic drugs enter the market. Brand recognition and customer loyalty can mitigate these sales declines, but only partially. Therefore, a key source of a pharmaceutical firm's moat, and a significant barrier to entry for most pharmaceutical firms, is its drug pipeline.

Merck's moat is primarily based on its intangible assets, specifically its patents and brand name. The company has several blockbuster drugs such as KEYTRUDA (cancer) and JANUVIA/JANUMET (diabetes). These products generate significant revenue and cash flow for the firm. However, Keytruda will lose patent protection within the next decade, and Januvia/Janumet have already lost patent protection in many key markets. Merck faces increasing competition from biosimilars in several other categories. Merck has not been successful in expanding beyond its core business.

The company has a moderately diversified portfolio of products but is reliant on the eventual success of its products in its drug pipeline. Its business model is fundamentally dependent on continued innovation and successful commercialization of these new drugs. Failure in either would have an adverse impact on the companyâ€™s sales and valuation.

**Moat Rating Justification**

Merck's moat is rated 3/5, reflecting a narrow moat. Although Merck currently benefits from successful, patented drugs, the approaching patent expirations and increasing competition from biosimilars suggest a weakening of its competitive advantage. This rating reflects a pessimistic and skeptical outlook, considering the challenges inherent in pharmaceutical innovation and the potential for pipeline disappointments.

**Valuation**

Based on Merck's financial filings from 2019 to 2023, we used a five-year explicit forecast period for a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using free cash flow to the firm (FCFF). For simplicity, we used only publicly available data. We also calculated a value using the economic-profit framework. 

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth of 3% for the next five years (2024-2028) gradually declining from 7% to 1% in terminal value computations. We assumed annual global market growth of approximately 5%
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a stable after-tax operating margin of 25% from 2024 onwards.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Estimated based on revenue change, and prior reinvestment practices.
* **Cost of Capital:** 
    * **Cost of Equity:** We used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The risk-free rate was 3.80%, the market risk premium was 4.5%, and the unlevered beta was 0.69 (from comparable companies). We assumed a 20% debt weight.
    * **Cost of Debt:** We used 4.5% (based on Merck's cost of 3.75% as of February 28, 2024, plus 75 basis points)
    * **Marginal Tax Rate:** 21% (US Statutory rate)
* **Terminal Value:** We use the perpetuity growth method. The terminal growth rate is 1%, and the terminal value discount rate is adjusted based on the expected decline in returns from current levels (11.7%) to stable growth levels (8.5%). 


**Valuation Calculation**

1. **Forecasting:**  Projected financial results for Merck were created using the explicit forecast period assumptions described above. 
2. **Reorganizing Financial Statements:**  We reorganized Merck's financial statements to create free cash flow (FCFF) and return on invested capital (ROIC), and we reconciled the different financial statements to make sure that the models were balanced.
3. **Valuation:** Computed the present value of projected cash flows, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital, and added to that the present value of the terminal value to determine the value of the firm.
4. **Subtracting non-equity claims:** From the firm value, we then subtracted non-equity claims including debt and minority interests. The final value was then divided by the number of shares outstanding.

**Result:** The DCF and EP models both resulted in valuations around $205 Billion, and a value per share in the low $80s.

**Conclusion**

Merck is a large pharmaceutical company with a narrow moat. The company faces significant headwinds with patent expirations and increasing biosimilar competition. Our valuation suggests that the stock is fairly valued at $205B. This valuation is based on a pessimistic and conservative outlook. Any substantial downside surprises in its drug pipeline or a faster erosion of pricing power could put significant downward pressure on the stock. On the other hand, successful new drug launches and more effective management of competition could lead to upside surprises. Given the uncertainty inherent in pharmaceutical investing, it is crucial to buy at a significant margin of safety.
