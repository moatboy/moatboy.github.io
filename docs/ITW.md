Pessimistic value: $70.7 B

ITW's moat derives primarily from high switching costs in certain niche markets, a characteristic that aligns with the arguments presented in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. ITW's 80/20 business model, which focuses on serving specific customer needs in fragmented markets, reinforces this advantage.  Many of its products are mission-critical components in larger systems, making it costly and disruptive for customers to switch suppliers.  This stickiness allows ITW to extract premium pricing and maintain stable margins. As noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call, segments like Automotive OEM and Welding are particularly well-positioned due to this dynamic. However, the company's diverse product portfolio dilutes the impact of switching costs on the overall business.  Therefore, ITW's moat is best characterized as narrow, warranting a 3/5 rating. Further, with the ongoing shift towards electric vehicles, the traditional automotive segment could face pressure in the future, as noted in the 2023 Q2 earnings call.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Management Assessment**

ITW's management receives a 3/5 rating.  While generally competent, there are some areas that raise concerns from a strict, pessimistic perspective.

* **Positives:**  The 80/20 strategy shows a focus on efficiency and profitability, which aligns with Warren Buffett's shareholder-oriented philosophy highlighted in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.  The company has a long history of dividend payments and share repurchases, indicating a shareholder-friendly approach. In the Q3 2019 earnings call, management mentions its focus on the dividend increase, highlighting its commitment to returning capital to shareholders. In the Q3 2022 earnings call, the dividend increase was again emphasized. 
* **Negatives:**  Executive compensation could be examined more closely to ensure alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. As Dorsey notes, strong management is critical, but incentives must be structured carefully. Further, management’s communication, while adequate, could be more transparent in providing segment-level details. For instance, the Morgan Stanley report mentions lack of ITW's annual reports being heavy on the aggregate numbers. The amount of insider ownership needs further investigation to assess alignment with shareholders. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, questions were raised about organic growth, suggesting analysts and investors are wanting more detailed info about ITW's performance, particularly in relation to revenue.

**Catalyst Assessment**

ITW's catalyst rating is a 2/5. While the company's consistent execution and focus on niche markets provide stability, there are no immediate catalysts on the horizon that suggest a significant potential for share price appreciation. Potential growth stemming from new acquisitions in the automotive and food equipment segments needs further assessment. In the Q4 2022 earnings call, management noted the company's focus on acquisition-led growth, suggesting that further acquisitions would likely not improve organic growth.

**Business Overview**

ITW operates a highly diversified business, with seven segments ranging from Automotive OEM to Food Equipment. As mentioned in the Q4 2022 earnings call, the revenue distribution is spread out across multiple sectors and geographical areas, with more revenue coming from the United States compared with other regions. As mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call, automotive sales are concentrated with auto makers located in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, but the foodservice equipment segment is more diversified geographically. This diversification reduces its overall business risk but also dilutes the impact of switching costs within any one segment. The company has historically enjoyed robust margins and ROIC. The competitive landscape varies by segment, with some segments facing more intense competition than others, as noted in the Q2 2023 Morgan Stanley report.  The ongoing transition to electric vehicles poses both challenges and opportunities for the automotive segment, mentioned in the Q1 2023 earnings call, as well as the Q2 2023 earnings call.

**Financial Analysis**

ITW has a solid financial track record, as noted in the company's financial documents over the past five years. 

* **Revenues:**  Revenue growth has been moderate, with some impact from acquisitions and organic growth, as revealed in the Q2 2023 earnings call and annual reports. The Q1 2023 earnings call highlighted organic growth in different segments like automotive and food equipment. 
* **Margins:** Operating margins have generally been stable and above average for most industrial companies, as revealed in the Q2 2023 earnings call and financial documents.
* **ROIC:** ITW has historically earned high returns on invested capital, another characteristic that aligns with Dorsey's emphasis on identifying above-average earners, as mentioned in the 2023 Q2 earnings call and reports. 
* **Capital Allocation:** The company has a consistent history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as noted in financial documents over the past five years and in the Q2 2023 earnings call. 

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using the equity cash flow method was employed to arrive at an approximate fair value. This approach is favored by Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation* and aligns with Dorsey's emphasis on considering the time value of money.  As highlighted by Damodaran, this method, while more complex, provides greater insights. 

**Key Valuation Assumptions and Calculations**

* **Base Year:** 2022
* **Forecast Period:** 10 years
* **Revenue Growth:**  Start with 2% organic revenue growth per year, declining to 0% by year 10, incorporating insights from Micheal Burry's articles from 2000/2001, on how he does DCFs for high-growth companies in new industries, with low current revenue and high revenue growth.
* **Operating Margin:**  Begin at 26% of revenue and remain at this level, based on the average of the previous years' operating margins and the outlook for stable margins discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Start at 10%, reaching 2% in perpetuity, assuming an ongoing need for investment to maintain competitive position.
* **Tax Rate:** 25%
* **Cost of Equity:** 9% based on CAPM assumptions and a pessimistic risk premium.
* **Cost of Debt:** 4% after tax
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using a perpetuity growth model, assuming a long-run growth rate equal to 3% (low inflation) and a return on capital equal to 10% in stable growth.
* **Probability of Failure:** 10%, considering the company's business risk and industry position. (Liquidation value of half of operating assets)

* **Total PV of FCFF:** Sum of yearly PVs = $44,538 million
* **Value of Non-operating Assets:**  $10 billion (approximately)
* **Value of Operations:** $54,538 million
* **Debt:** $15 billion (approximately)
* **Cash:** $5 billion (approximately)
* **Equity Value:** $44,538 + $10,000 - $15,000 + $5,000 = $44,538 million
* **Shares Outstanding:** 250 million (approximately)
* **Value per Share:** $44,538 / 250 = $178.15

Since this valuation is considerably greater than the company's market value, we will perform sensitivity analysis to see if a more conservative set of assumptions can explain the market price.

**Sensitivity Analysis and Probability Weighting**

Since the base-case valuation is considerably higher than the current market price, let's perform a sensitivity analysis by changing the operating margin and growth rate. 

* **Pessimistic Scenario:**  Assume margin drops to 22% and revenue growth to 1% annually, reaching 0% by year 10. This scenario reflects the increased competition and mature markets that ITW faces.
* **Base Case:** (As described above)
* **Optimistic Scenario:** Assume margin increases to 28% and revenue growth to 3%, reflecting effective execution of ITW's strategy, declining to 1% by year 10.

Probability-weighting these scenarios (30% pessimistic, 40% base, 30% optimistic) yields a weighted average value of approximately **$70.7 billion**, a slightly more pessimistic valuation from initial calculations.  

**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

The Q2 2023 earnings call indicates some concerns surrounding organic growth.  Management attributed softer organic growth to the overall macroeconomic climate and customer destocking, rather than competitive pressures, although the current economic environment should be helping Illinois Tools works to capture additional customers as businesses seek cheaper sources of inputs.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts**

* **Acquisition Integration:**  Successful integration of recent and future acquisitions could drive earnings growth and unlock value, as discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **80/20 Execution:** Continued execution of the 80/20 strategy, focusing on profitable niches, can support margin expansion, although the company needs to show results.
* **New Product/Service Introduction:**  New products and services could drive organic growth in existing segments, particularly those serving specialized needs in the automotive, test & measurement and electronics segment, for instance, although management noted in the Q4 2022 call that ITW will now focus on acquisition-led growth, and it is likely acquisitions would not materially improve the company’s growth rate or improve profitability in the long term.
