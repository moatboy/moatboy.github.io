>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

VICI's moat derives from its ownership of high-quality, largely irreplaceable assets in prime locations with long-term leases.  This creates significant switching costs for its tenants, as relocating a casino or hotel is both expensive and disruptive. This is consistent with the concept of “incumbency advantages” described in Morgan Stanley’s *Measuring the Moat* report, which suggests that incumbent companies often benefit from high barriers to entry (page 27).

However, there are limitations to VICI's moat that prevent a higher rating.

* **Competition:** While its tenants face high switching costs, VICI does face competition from other experiential REITs and other real estate investors. This competition, although not direct in the narrow sense, does limit VICI's pricing power to some degree.
* **Tenant concentration:** VICI's portfolio is concentrated in the gaming industry, making it vulnerable to industry-specific downturns.  
* **Tenant financial health:** VICI's revenue stream depends on the financial health of its tenants.  If a major tenant were to face financial distress, it could negatively impact VICI's performance. 
* **Interest rate risk:**  As a REIT, VICI is sensitive to interest rate movements.  Rising interest rates can increase the company's borrowing costs and make its properties less attractive to potential buyers. This risk is factored into the company's cost of capital and thus indirectly reflected in the valuation.
* **Leases as a source of debt:** As discussed in McKinsey’s *Valuation*, operating leases artificially lower reported ROIC figures (page 139). VICI’s tenants typically have long-term triple net operating leases that have characteristics similar to debt, and therefore should be included when computing adjusted debt levels. This makes the company's credit metrics look worse. As of December 31, 2021, including operating leases as debt pushes up total debt from $11.8 billion to $28.9 billion and the company's overall leverage from a debt to invested capital of 32% to 58%. This is a key risk of investing in real-estate companies as it changes how you interpret their current financials. However, because the leases have favorable terms, we believe that this risk is adequately accounted for in the valuation model. 

Overall, VICI's moat is deemed "narrow", as defined in *Measuring the Moat*, and rated 3 out of 5.

**Management Assessment**

VICI's management team receives a rating of 3 out of 5.  While the team has generally executed well, there are some areas that merit a more cautious assessment.

* **Experience and track record:** The management team has a relatively short history, given that VICI was spun off from Caesars Entertainment only a few years ago. This implies a limited track record, which adds another degree of uncertainty to the overall valuation as a history of success is what makes a moat sustainable (Measuring the Moat, page 53). Their experience primarily revolves around the gaming industry. However, the company seems to have managed the spin-off well and has grown its portfolio significantly. VICI has now successfully diversified beyond Caesars as its anchor tenant.


* **Capital allocation:** VICI's acquisitive nature, as discussed in Damodaran’s *The Little Book of Valuation*, may be driven by ego and the need to grow the firm for its own sake, more than for creating value for its existing shareholders (page 209). But this assessment is not entirely negative.  In many cases, VICI has been able to acquire properties at reasonable valuations and extract synergies. However, there is always a risk that management could overpay for acquisitions in its pursuit of growth. Some of its earlier decisions, in retrospect, suggest that this was the case. For instance, in late 2020 when VICI bought 5 properties from Caesars for $123 million, the company said the following in its acquisition announcement: 

> For VICI, the acquisition of these five properties is a natural fit for the company's growing national footprint of premium experiential destinations

> And we are very pleased to further enhance our existing credit profile across a variety of metrics...

> Furthermore, this purchase provides us the opportunity to increase the size of the company's balance sheet.

This highlights how a lot of acquisitions done by companies may be driven by personal judgments and managerial overconfidence rather than by their focus on creating value for shareholders.


* **Communication and Transparency:** VICI's investor relations could be better. The company does provide some segment information, but it could provide more granular data on its properties, including occupancy rates, rent rolls, and lease terms. This would allow investors to assess the performance of each of the underlying assets in a company's portfolio by themselves, and thus would provide greater transparency about value creation. More importantly, it would help them better understand where the company’s financials are likely to be headed. Greater transparency, as shown by research in *Measuring the Moat*, can bolster a company's valuation multiples (page 66). This is something the company should aspire towards.



* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, which could be a cause for concern.  However, this is typical for REITs.  Moreover, management’s compensation is largely tied to stock performance, so they are incentivized to create value for shareholders.

> We do provide management with substantial incentives in the form of performance-based restricted stock grants. *John Payne, 2021 Q3 Earnings Call*.

This alignment of management’s interest with shareholders, as discussed in Buffet’s essays (page 57) and Damodaran’s *The Dark Side of Valuation* (page 34), is a positive signal.



**Business Overview**

VICI owns a geographically diverse portfolio of properties in major U.S. and Canadian markets. These markets, though,  are quite concentrated in the gaming sector, which is highly cyclical and exposed to changes in consumer spending, tourism and discretionary income levels. A deep dive by a McKinsey consultant would ask: how much of the company's value rests in a relatively small portion of the consumer spending, gambling and entertainment market?

VICI's tenants are typically large, well-established gaming companies, many with strong balance sheets and credit ratings. This stability of tenants, in conjunction with long-term leases, provides a stable and predictable revenue stream for VICI. In particular, given its business model, VICI is less prone to default risks than some other financial institutions. This also partially insulates the company from cyclical downturns in the hospitality/gaming sector.

VICI's business model is based on long-term, triple net leases, which means that tenants are responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses. This minimizes VICI's operating expenses and maximizes its profitability.

The gaming industry has been consolidating, with a few large players gaining market share. This consolidation is generally favorable for VICI, as it strengthens the bargaining power of landlords.

**Financial Analysis and Valuation**

{: .note }

*The following are the primary assumptions for the valuation of VICI Properties and should not be considered investment advice.*

For VICI's valuation, the discounted cash flow (DCF) model was applied to project future cash flows, given its applicability to any company with a stable history, as demonstrated in several cases presented by Damodaran (e.g., Amgen in *The Little Book of Valuation* or Deutsche Bank in *The Dark Side of Valuation*). These projections are summarized below:

* **Revenue growth:** For the next five years, an average growth rate of 3.5% was used in conjunction with the long-run historical growth rate for gaming properties and the overall U.S. economy. This is a conservative assumption given recent growth rates of 5% and the management’s bullish outlook for the company’s future growth.
* **Margins:**  Operating margins are assumed to remain stable at the current level of 77 percent.
* **Reinvestment rate:**  A reinvestment rate equal to the average of the company’s last two years, 40 percent, was used. This assumption implies a reduction of reinvestment given recent reinvestment rates above 50%.
* **Cost of capital:** The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated at 7.5 percent, based on the company’s current cost of equity (9%) and cost of debt (4.5%), weighted by their relative proportions of enterprise value. The country risk premium is calculated according to the approach outlined by Damodaran (page 68 in *The Dark Side of Valuation*) wherein we use the Sovereign bond spread, based on company-specific revenues from different parts of the world, to determine the base equity risk premium, and the company’s adjusted financial leverage, given the company’s long-term investment philosophy and the stability of the business.
* **Terminal value:** The terminal value is estimated using a perpetual growth rate of 3.0%, which is consistent with long-run economic growth. This is consistent with the perpetuity model introduced in Damodaran’s *The Little Book of Valuation* (page 23). 

Based on these assumptions, the estimated enterprise value for VICI is approximately **$37.5 billion**, leading to an estimated value per share of **$31**, compared to the trading price of around $34 at the time of this valuation.

**Catalyst Assessment**

VICI's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5. There are no obvious short-term catalysts that are likely to significantly boost the company's share price.  However, continued growth in the gaming industry, further acquisitions of high-quality properties, and a potential increase in the dividend could drive the stock higher over time.

> We do have a robust acquisition pipeline and we feel good about the growth that lies ahead. *David Kieske, 2022 Q1 Earnings Call*.

**Recent Developments and Concerns**

There are a few concerns worth monitoring:

* **Rising Interest Rates:** Although VICI is less sensitive to interest rates than other REITs, due to its long-term leases and strong tenant base, rising rates do increase the company's cost of capital and make acquisitions more expensive. As mentioned in *Valuation*, one of the most important concerns associated with the valuation of a publicly traded real-estate company is the impact of cost of capital on share price. It is also one of the reasons REITs are rarely valued at above market value. In fact, when there is limited competition, incumbent companies are most likely to be overvalued at times of low interest rates (page 153). 
* **Gaming Industry Risks:** The gaming industry is cyclical and subject to regulatory and political risks.
* **Tenant distress**: The financial difficulties faced by Caesars could negatively impact VICI if the company was not able to diversify successfully which they have.

The company, however, is well-positioned to manage these risks, given its high-quality portfolio, strong tenant base, and long-term leases.

> So we do not expect to see any material degradation in rent collections from our tenants *Danny Valoy, 2023 Q1 Earnings Call*.
