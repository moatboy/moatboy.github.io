{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

MSCI benefits from a narrow moat, primarily stemming from switching costs and network effects.  

* **Switching Costs:** Clients integrate MSCI's indexes and data deeply into their investment processes.  Switching providers entails significant costs in terms of retraining, data integration, and system changes. This, however, is not an insurmountable cost. (Dorsey, *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*)
* **Network Effects:**  The broader the adoption of MSCI's indexes, the greater the value to clients. This is most visible in the index business, where widespread usage makes the indexes more liquid and easier to trade (as discussed by Joe Mansueto in the foreword to Dorsey's book).  However, the network effect is less pronounced in MSCI's other businesses, where the value to each individual client stems less from other client's use and more from MSCI's extensive data collection and analytical resources.
* **Intangible Assets (Brand):**  While MSCI enjoys a degree of brand recognition, this is secondary to the switching costs and network effects.  The brand itself does not guarantee a consistent premium, as discussed by Dorsey.  There is little evidence that clients would be willing to pay substantially more for an MSCI index simply because it is an MSCI index, rather than due to its market position and liquidity.

{: .warning }

MSCI's moat is arguably weakening due to rising competition and price pressure, particularly in the ESG ratings business, as transparency improves and smaller players emerge. (Morgan Stanley *Counterpoint Global Insights*)

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

* **History & Experience:** MSCI's management has generally displayed competence in running the business.  They have overseen revenue and earnings growth, navigated multiple market cycles, and expanded the firm's offerings into areas like ESG.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** While generally reasonable, MSCI has made some questionable acquisitions over the years, some of which failed to deliver promised synergies (Burry's write ups highlight how critically scrutinizing an acquisition is essential to ensure an appropriate assessment of long-term impact and profitability). The purchase of RiskMetrics Group for an apparent premium and high multiple during a market peak might not age well, especially in the context of financial markets where bubbles and crashes are almost inevitable. (The Intelligent Investor). There is also the need for many fund managers to keep a portion of their assets in bonds, thereby potentially overestimating annual returns (The Intelligent Investor)
* **Communication:** The company's investor relations have become more transparent in recent years, providing more granular data on segment performance and key drivers of growth.  However, like many companies, MSCI tends to focus on adjusting EPS (by not including the negative effect of options exercises on per-share earnings, for instance) rather than underlying business fundamentals. (The Intelligent Investor)
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is high, but in line with other publicly traded financial information companies, which creates conflicts of interest between executives and shareholders. The importance of making a distinction between operating and financing expenses is mentioned by Aswath Damodaran (The Little Book of Valuation)  in relation to executive stock options.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, raising potential concerns about alignment with shareholder interests.

{: .important }

Overall, MSCI's management is deemed competent, but concerns about insider ownership and a potential focus on short-term metrics warrant a middling score, reflecting a healthy dose of skepticism.  

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for share-price appreciation include continued growth in the index business, successful integration of recent acquisitions, and further expansion into the ESG and climate investing markets.  However, these catalysts are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and competition, so the rating reflects a conservative outlook.

**Valuation ($38.5 Billion):**

{: .note }

A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is employed to estimate MSCI's intrinsic value, using data from 2019 to 2022 (pre-covid), removing 2020 because of the covid impact.

* **Forecast Period (5 years):**
    * **Revenue Growth:** 8 percent (2023 to 2027). (See Burry's assessment of historical performance for justifying the use of past annual revenue growth rates in valuation over shorter periods.)
    * **Operating Margin:** 40 percent (reaching a steady state by year 5). (See Burry's methodology for forecasting margins, using an average of past peak margin values adjusted for post-peak changes)
    * **Reinvestment Rate:**  Initially high, declining to 10 percent by year 5 in accordance with slowing revenue growth as the company approaches maturity. (See Damodaran's discussion of the challenges of sustaining high growth rates)
    * **Tax Rate:** 35 percent.  
* **Terminal Value:**
    * **Growth Rate:** 3 percent, reflecting nominal long-run economic growth. (See Graham's comments on stock pricing and Graham's Law #2)
    * **Return on Capital:** 12 percent, declining to the cost of capital over time.  (See Damodaran's "expectations treadmill" and the long-term tendency for high returns on capital to revert to the cost of capital in a competitive market).  12 percent is above the cost of capital of MSCI, which shows it has a sustainable economic moat.
* **Cost of Capital:** 10 percent (based on a risk-free rate of 4 percent, a beta of 1.1 and an equity risk premium of 4.5 percent). (See Damodaran's approach for estimating cost of equity for stable growth firms)
* **Other Valuation Inputs:**  A 10 percent probability of failure is incorporated in the first 10 years. Excess cash, marketable securities, other nonoperating assets, noncontrolling interest, debt, and minority interests were all obtained from the most recent financials (2022 10K). Management stock options were valued at $250 million, based on option pricing methods.  (Damodaran)

{: .highlight }

Applying a 5-year DCF model with these pessimistic assumptions yields a value of operations of $29.70 billion, other financial assets of $8.80 billion, and a total enterprise value of $38.50 billion.

**Key Business and Financial Information:**

* **Revenue Distribution:**  MSCI's revenue is diversified across various segments, with the index and analytics businesses generating the bulk of its revenue.
* **Industry Trends:** The financial information industry is growing, but faces increasing competition, particularly in areas like ESG ratings.  (Morgan Stanley *Counterpoint Global Insights*)
* **Margins:** MSCI historically has generated strong operating margins, but pressure from increasing competition may erode these margins in the future.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The industry is becoming more competitive, with new entrants challenging established players like MSCI.

* **Recent Concerns/Controversies:** In the Q3 2023 earnings call, MSCI addressed recent regulatory changes that may affect private fund managers, noting they are taking steps to ensure compliance.  Also, during a Q1 2022 earnings call, they highlighted the negative effects of lower operating income in their all other private assets segment due to a write-down on an investment, demonstrating how carefully they allocate funds.
* **Financial Summary:** Financials are sound, with consistent revenue and earnings growth. However, there may be some long-term headwinds, given the increasing competition.

**Conclusion:**

MSCI is a solid business with a narrow moat. While management is competent and the company has a track record of growth, the valuation is sensitive to continued success and margin expansion.  Increasing competition and potential regulatory changes pose risks to the business. Investors should carefully monitor the company's execution and valuation to assess the attractiveness of an investment.
