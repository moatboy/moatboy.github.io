### Management Assessment: 3/5

Veralto's management team earns a middling rating of 3 out of 5.

* **Experience and History:** The management team has experience in the industry. As per the company’s 2023 Annual Report, the President and Chief Executive Officer has served in that capacity since September 27, 2021. Other key executives have had shorter tenures at the company, ranging from 1 to 13 years. They have successfully navigated several industry cycles. However, the company's recent performance has been uneven, especially considering VLTO is transitioning from a slower growth industrial company to one focused more on digital technology. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation, as detailed in the company's proxy statement, seems in line with industry averages. The CEO received total compensation of $5.55 million in 2022. This ties compensation to some financial metrics but includes an important portion of stock options. Stock options dilute existing shareholders and, as per Damodaran's "The Dark Side of Valuation", don't always reflect true costs incurred.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low. As per the company's latest proxy statement,  the CEO owns 0.5 percent of the outstanding shares. This could imply a lower incentive for management to act in the best interests of all shareholders.
* **Communication:**  Management communication is generally transparent, and they have started discussing their "strategy" more in earnings calls, specifically explaining how they plan to transform the company digitally. In the Q1 2024 earnings call, the CEO described specific plans to continue to scale digital platforms and software. However, while this communication is beneficial to shareholders, it is hard to say whether the market gives these long-term growth prospects much credence.

>  The company’s strategic repositioning and focus on digital could act as a catalyst for stock price appreciation, if these efforts are successfully implemented. 

* **Capital Allocation:**  Veralto's history of acquisitions is a mixed bag. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, the CEO noted that the integration of the latest acquisition (the $178 million acquisition of Domnick Hunter completed in July 2022) is going well. While some acquisitions have been value accretive, others have been less successful. Recent capital allocation has also been focused on debt reduction. Further improvements in capital allocation will be crucial for unlocking value.


### Business Overview

Veralto operates in a variety of markets, offering products and services related to water safety and flow control.

* **Revenues Distribution:** The company's revenue comes from a mix of residential (53%), commercial (28%), and industrial (19%) customers. Its revenues have been growing slightly below the average for the industrial sector.
* **Industry Trends:** The industry is experiencing slow growth overall, although Veralto has been focusing on higher-growth areas, such as digital technology, water quality monitoring, and drainage systems.
* **Margins:**  Veralto's margins are in line with industry averages. In 2022, the company reported an EBITDA margin of 16.1%, while for the industrial sector as a whole it was slightly lower at 15.7%.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The industry is highly fragmented, with no single player dominating the market. Veralto's largest competitors include Xylem, Franklin Electric, and Pentair. 
* **Differentiation:** Veralto differentiates itself through its global presence, broad product portfolio, and focus on water solutions. This includes an increasingly sophisticated suite of software applications.

> Despite the company's strengths, intense competition limits pricing power and profitability in many of its markets. This makes it very hard to find a company with a significant moat, or durable competitive advantage.


### Financial Analysis

Veralto's financial performance has been uneven in recent years.

* **Revenues:**  For its fiscal year 2023, Veralto's total revenue was $3.1 billion, down from $3.2 billion in 2022 and relatively flat compared with 2021.
* **Profitability:**  The company's net income was $266 million, resulting in a net margin of 8.6%.
* **Capital Structure:**  Veralto had total debt of $1.5 billion and equity of $1.5 billion,  for a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** The company's ROIC (excluding goodwill) in 2023 was 12.1 percent. This represents a good rate, and the company shows some promise of sustainable ROIC, if we believe the new, digital strategy will pay off. But the trend is quite difficult to forecast, especially in the highly competitive consumer sector.

### Valuation

Given its modest growth prospects and competitive industry, we are approaching Veralto's valuation with a healthy dose of skepticism and pessimism.

* **Methodology:** We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the company's intrinsic value. As noted in McKinsey’s *Valuation*, we prefer the DCF approach when we have sufficient information for forecasting.  We value the entire business and then subtract out net debt (Total Debt - Excess Cash and Marketable Securities).
* **Key Assumptions:**
    * **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth of 3% for the next five years, in line with anticipated GDP growth and consistent with the company's historical growth rate.
    * **Operating Margin:** We assume an operating margin of 14%, slightly below the company’s 2023 margin (16.1%), reflecting competitive pressures. 
    * **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 40%, roughly in line with historical levels.
    * **Cost of Capital:** We estimate a cost of capital of 8.5%, reflecting the company's risk profile and the current market environment.

> Using the perpetuity growth method gives a terminal value at the end of year 10 of $4.192 billion. Discounting the cash flows and the terminal value back at the cost of capital gives a total enterprise value of $3.725 billion. Subtracting net debt (Total Debt – Excess Cash) gives an equity valuation of $2.233 billion.


### Catalyst Rating: 2/5

The catalyst rating for Veralto is a modest 2 out of 5. Veralto’s strategic repositioning and focus on digital could act as a catalyst for stock price appreciation if these efforts are successfully implemented and reflected in margins. However, the company is in the midst of a transformation, and it is likely that investors are waiting to see evidence of sustainable improvement in both growth and profitability before giving the company's shares a higher multiple.

>  Veralto's share price could also be favorably impacted by industry consolidation. If the industry consolidates around a few large players, Veralto is likely to be one of them.


### Additional Considerations: 

* **Recent Concerns/Controversies:** In recent earnings calls, there has been discussion about supply chain disruptions, raw material price increases, inflationary cost pressures, and macroeconomic concerns. Despite these challenges, Veralto has demonstrated some resilience, though its growth has been muted. The company has also been focusing on digital initiatives to improve operating margins and strengthen customer relationships and services. 
* **Risks:**  Key risks for the company include competitive intensity, cyclicality in certain markets, and macroeconomic weakness.  The company operates in a variety of end markets, some of which are cyclical, such as residential new construction and industrial markets. The company is also subject to macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth, interest rates, and foreign currency fluctuations.

> In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management discussed recent efforts to streamline the manufacturing network, with the goal of being leaner and faster-turning. This cost-reduction strategy should be closely scrutinized in the coming years to see whether management is able to achieve sustainable cost efficiency gains and whether these gains are accretive to profits and value.

> The success of Veralto's transformation is not guaranteed. However, at the right price, the company could be an attractive investment for an investor with a long-term horizon and a strong stomach.
