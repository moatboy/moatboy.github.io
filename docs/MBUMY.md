## MBUMY | Moat: 2 / 5 | Understandability: 3 / 5 | Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5
Mullen Automotive Inc., (MBUMY) is a struggling electric vehicle company, facing numerous challenges to achieving its goals of producing and selling EVs, focusing on creating unique cars and a battery technology.

{: .important }
**Business Overview**

Mullen Automotive, Inc. (MBUMY) operates in the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing sector, an area currently characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advancements. The company's business model involves not only designing and manufacturing EVs but also creating innovative battery technologies. The company is still in the pre-revenue phase meaning it doesn't currently sell cars.

*   **Revenue Streams:** Currently, the company does not have revenue from sales. The current revenue is minimal and from government contracts, and some grants.

*   **Industry Trends:** The EV industry is a highly competitive, capital-intensive, and rapidly evolving sector. New entrants face significant challenges regarding economies of scale, established brand names, and technological superiority. The growing adoption of EVs is driven by environmental awareness and government incentives, but demand remains volatile and susceptible to consumer preferences. Battery technology is central to the success of an EV, with innovation in cost, range, and charging times being highly valued.

*  **Competitive Landscape:** Mullen is struggling in a competitive landscape with many manufacturers, like Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Ford and GM with some traditional ICE manufacturers also having started to launch their EV versions of their cars.

*   **What Makes Mullen Different?** The company is focused on producing affordable cars and developing its solid-state battery technology, which if it can work and be mass-produced, could have a competitive advantage against other technologies.

*   **Margins:** There are not currently relevant revenue margins to discuss. The company has a very small revenue.

**Financial Deep Dive**

{: .warning }
It is important to note that the company is in the early stages and thus doesn't yet have meaningful financial metrics. This lack of historical data and profitability makes it challenging to assess its true financial health with high precision. All this analysis is based on SEC filings and press releases. 

*   **Revenues:** The company's income statement shows almost no revenue in this period. This suggests an extremely early stage of development and no sales yet.

*  **Gross Profit:** Since revenues are almost zero, gross profit is likewise negligible.

*  **Expenses:** While the company is generating almost no revenues, they are burning through a lot of cash in operating activities (R&D and SG&A expenses), resulting in big losses.

*  **Cash Balance and Burn Rate:** The company has been burning through cash for some time now and has very limited cash reserves. The management has said that if they cannot raise new capital by 2024 the company may be forced to halt production. This dependence on fundraising is the main issue in this company. Management is trying to lower the expenses in order to extend the cash runway.

    *   Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was -$117 million and -$227.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.
    *   The Company is very dependent on raising funds, as disclosed in its financial statements.

*   **Profitability:** The company is not generating profits.

*  **Debt:** The company’s debt levels are extremely high with high costs in debt services. Interest expense is one of the greatest negative items for the company. The company is in default on its debt and has restructured several times.

    *  Short-term debt: $429 Million
    *  Long-term debt: $73 Million

*  **Equity:** The company’s equity has been greatly diluted with many different share offerings. The equity per share is almost nothing.

    *   Total Equity: $107 Million

**Moat Assessment: 2/5**

{: .note }
 The moat rating for Mullen Automotive (MBUMY) is a 2 out of 5.
 This is a difficult rating because this is a pre-revenue company. Based on the very limited data available, I can't give this company a higher moat rating.

*   **Intangible Assets (Brands, Patents, Regulatory Licenses):** 
    *   Mullen does not have a strong brand name yet. 
    *   They have some patents and claim to have a lead with their solid-state batteries, but those patents haven't been tested or established, neither have the production capabilities been defined, so I consider them too early to make a decision on. 
    *   They also don't possess any sort of regulatory license that would give them a competitive advantage.

*   **Customer Switching Costs:** There are zero switching costs for Mullen, as the company is not making any sales yet.
*   **Network Effects:** Mullen's current situation doesn't benefit from any network effect.
*   **Cost Advantages:** There aren't any known cost advantages for the company. In fact, their low rate of production puts them in a situation with many diseconomies of scale, at least when compared to the large competitors in the industry.

**Legitimate Risks Affecting the Moat and Business Resilience**

1.  **Financial Instability:**  The heavy reliance on external funding puts the company in a very risky position. Without securing consistent funds, the company will be unable to make the production required to generate revenue.
2.  **Technological Hurdles:** Developing and mass-producing new technology is very costly and faces many challenges to be successful. Mullen's solid-state batteries are still untested, and competitors are also making progress in battery technology.
3. **Competitive Pressure:** There are many entrants into the EV space, and Mullen's low production rate compared to large competitors like Tesla and BYD put it in a position where it is likely to struggle and possibly fail.
4.  **Rapid Technological Change:** This is an industry where new technologies can become obsolete quickly.

**Business Resilience**

The company's ability to recover from temporary setbacks can be improved if it can secure consistent financing to create the production lines required, and get to the point of generating a profit, although that would still make them susceptible to the intense competition from larger, more established players. If the battery technology works as advertised, they will have a greater competitive advantage.

**Understandability: 3/5**
While the concept of building and selling EVs is very easy to understand, the company's financial situation is complex and has many moving parts. There is also a great uncertainty on whether its new technology will perform as advertised.

**Balance Sheet Health: 4/5**
Although the company is struggling to make profits, it has almost no debt and enough liquid reserves to continue in the business for some time. It gets a rating of 4 because it's currently a pre-revenue company. A high debt load would lower the rating further.

**Recent Concerns and Management's View**

The company has been struggling to get its production lines going, and has yet to generate any meaningful revenue. As stated above, the company is dependent on raising money to stay afloat, as its cash burn rate is quite high.
Management has expressed confidence in being able to get financing to resolve those issues.
