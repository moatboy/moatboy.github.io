Pessimistic value: $90 billion

Citigroup's moat is narrow, primarily derived from its brand name, scale, and global presence in financial services.  {: .highlight }  However, these advantages are weakening due to intense competition, commoditization of financial products, and the rise of fintech. As a result, I give Citi's moat a rating of 2 out of 5.  This cautious view is based on the principle that moats should be assessed conservatively, as emphasized by both Graham and Buffett.  A truly wide moat company should be able to consistently earn excess returns even with subpar management, and Citigroup has shown few signs of this in recent years.  The financial crisis also highlighted its susceptibility to macro-level shocks and poor risk management.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .important }
Management receives a rating of 2 out of 5.   While Citigroup boasts a strong leadership team on paper, its track record over the past few decades has been checkered. Although executive compensation is aligned with performance, including restricted stock and stock options, significant value destruction through write-offs, losses, and ill-timed acquisitions raises concerns about capital allocation and risk management.  Moreover, communication has sometimes been less than transparent, particularly during the financial crisis.  For instance, the 2007 annual report did not adequately foreshadow the massive losses to come. The Citi Multiyear Transformation (CMT) program is a positive step towards improving long-term efficiency and performance but results have been mixed.

{: .new }
Catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.  The financial industry is cyclical. Citigroup is currently benefiting from higher interest rates, but this tailwind is likely to fade.  There are no immediately obvious catalysts on the horizon that would substantially alter Citigroup's trajectory. Cost-cutting and efficiency measures under the CMT may yield some benefits, but the competitive pressures facing Citi are likely to limit their impact. There is always the potential for an acquisition or divestiture, but these are difficult to predict and, on average, create little value.

{: .note }
Valuation is $90 billion.  This is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using a conservative, scenario-based approach.

**Valuation Methodology and Calculations:**

1. **Cash Flows:**  Projected free cash flow to equity (FCFE) for the next ten years (2024-2033) was estimated based on the following assumptions:
    * Revenue Growth:  Citigroup's revenues have shown modest growth over the past five years, and we assume this will continue over the next five years, then drop to 3 percent in perpetuity. (See Table below for yearly growth assumptions)
    * Operating Margins: Based on historical trends and the current banking industry average, assumed operating margin in stable growth is 35 percent.
    * Reinvestment Rate: Reinvestment rate, derived from projected capital expenditures and working capital needs, is forecast as 3.00% in perpetuity.

2. **Cost of Capital:**  A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 9% was used. This is based on a cost of equity of 11.67%, a cost of debt of 4.27%, a marginal tax rate of 25%, and a target capital structure (54% debt, 46% equity). The 11.67% cost of equity itself was derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), with a risk free rate of 3.8%, an equity beta of 1.27, and an equity risk premium of 6.5%.

3. **Terminal Value:**  A terminal value was calculated using the perpetuity growth method, assuming a growth rate of 3% and a cost of equity of 11.67%:

  ```
  Terminal Value = (FCFE in year 11) / (Cost of Equity - Stable Growth Rate)
  ```
  
4. **Probability of Failure:** Citi's bond rating is currently A. Based on historical default rates for A-rated bonds, we estimate a 5% probability of failure within the next 10 years, using a liquidation value of \$0. This conservative approach is necessary for several reasons. Firstly, banking is a cyclical and volatile sector. Secondly, the recent interest rate hikes and the banking crisis in March 2023 showed how quickly fortunes can reverse for financial service companies.

5. **Discounted Cash Flow:**  The present values of the projected FCFE and the terminal value were discounted back to the present value using the WACC.

6. **Nonoperating Assets:**  Citigroup's nonoperating assets, such as its investment banking division, were valued separately and added to the present value of its operations.

7. **Debt and Other Liabilities:** The present values of debt and other non-equity claims were estimated from publicly available information and subtracted from the total firm value.

8. **Value per Share:** The resulting firm value was divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at a value per share.

**Business Overview:**

Citigroup is a global financial services company, offering a broad range of products and services to consumers, corporations, governments, and institutions.  Its revenues are primarily generated from two business segments: Global Consumer Banking and Institutional Clients Group.

**Global Consumer Banking (GCB):** This segment offers traditional banking products and services (retail banking, branded cards, retail services, commercial banking) as well as wealth management solutions to consumers around the world. Growth in GCB has been driven primarily by emerging markets in recent years. Margins are compressed by competition from other banks, fintech companies, and increased regulatory requirements, but remain relatively stable at around 35 percent.

**Institutional Clients Group (ICG):** This segment provides a range of financial services including investment banking, markets and securities services, treasury and trade solutions, and private banking to corporations, governments, and institutions around the globe. ICG generates most of its revenues from fixed income, currencies, commodities, equity markets, and related businesses.  Margins are more volatile than GCB due to the cyclical nature of trading. Investment banking services are prone to substantial year-over-year fluctuations depending on market sentiment toward mergers, acquisitions, and debt and equity issuance.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Citigroup faces numerous headwinds, including increased regulatory scrutiny following the 2007-08 financial crisis, intense competition from smaller, more nimble banks and fintech firms, and geopolitical instability. It is also particularly exposed to economic downturns due to its heavy reliance on corporate and trading income.  The recent regional bank failures highlighted these risks. In its 2023 Q1 earnings call, CFO Mark Mason acknowledged the difficult environment while emphasizing Citigroup's robust capital and liquidity position.

**Management's Response to Challenges:**

Citigroup is undergoing a multiyear restructuring program, which includes: 
* **Exiting noncore businesses:** Selling off businesses in several countries and streamlining others.  In its first quarter 2024 earnings call, CEO Jane Fraser discussed these ongoing exits and reaffirmed Citi's commitment to focusing on its core strengths. 
* **Investing in technology:** Upgrading its systems, digitizing its services, and automating its operations.
* **Improving risk management:** Strengthening its risk controls and compliance procedures.

These initiatives are designed to improve its long-term profitability and growth but will likely take several years to fully realize their potential.  It remains to be seen whether these actions will be enough to address the challenges facing the firm.  A key question for investors is whether Citigroup will be able to improve its efficiency while continuing to maintain an adequate level of risk control.  In addition, the recent interest rate hikes have presented opportunities for cost-cutting and improving balance sheet efficiency.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful restructuring:** The success of the restructuring plan could boost investor confidence and lead to a re-rating of the stock. However, the restructuring program will likely take several years to fully implement, and there is no guarantee that it will be successful.
* **Economic recovery:** A strong rebound in the global economy would be beneficial for Citigroup, as it would increase demand for its products and services.  However, the timing and strength of an economic recovery are uncertain.
* **Acquisition or divestiture:** A strategic acquisition or divestiture could unlock value for shareholders. However, these are difficult to predict and, as Graham and Buffett have emphasized, often destroy value due to overpayment and integration difficulties.


Given the cyclical nature of banking and the potential macroeconomic headwinds, an appropriate investment strategy might involve a combination of value investing and margin of safety, as discussed by Graham in Chapter 20.  This would involve buying Citigroup's shares only at a significant discount to their intrinsic value, and being prepared to hold them for a long time, potentially many years.  In addition, it is important to note that Citigroup does not meet Graham's investment criteria outlined in Chapter 14 and 15 for a defensive investor which itself is not an endorsement.  For instance, its P/E ratio and price-to-book ratio are much higher than his recommended maximums, and its earnings growth has not been entirely stable.
