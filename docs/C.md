>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

Citigroup's revenues are derived from three primary sources:

* **Interest income (Net interest revenue):**  This is the core of Citi's business, earned from lending activities.  It represents the difference between what the bank pays on deposits and what it earns on loans and investments.  As interest rates fluctuate, so does net interest revenue.  Citi faces a challenge in balancing short-term loan financing needs with long-term investments.
* **Fee income (Commissions and fees):** Citigroup earns fee income from a variety of activities, including investment banking advisory, underwriting and placement of securities, managing investment funds, and providing securities brokerage services.
* **Trading income:**  This represents profits or losses from Citi's proprietary trading and market-making activities. It can be highly volatile and even result in losses.

**Industry Trends**

* **Increased regulation:** The financial sector is heavily regulated with capital requirements and lending limits.  These regulations are necessary for stability and to protect consumers but can also be very costly for banks.
* **Technological disruption:** Fintech companies are challenging traditional banks in many areas.  This creates both threats and opportunities for incumbents like Citigroup.
* **Consolidation:**  The banking industry has undergone significant consolidation in recent decades, driven by economies of scale and the need to compete with larger rivals.  Citi is now one of the few remaining "universal banks" that span both commercial and investment banking.
* **Globalization:** The financial services industry is increasingly global. Citigroup's global presence gives it a competitive advantage in some areas, but also exposes it to greater risks.

**Margins and ROIC**

Citigroup's margins and ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) have been under pressure in recent years due to a combination of low interest rates, increased competition, and higher regulatory costs.  Its return on equity in 2024 was around 9 percent.  This is below its cost of equity which is estimated at 10.4 percent.

**Competitive Advantages (Moat)**

Citigroup's competitive advantages are limited. Its universal banking model, once a source of strength, is now less of a differentiator as other large banks offer similar services.  Its global footprint gives it some advantages, but these are offset by increased complexity and risks.  Brand name and customer relationships do provide some customer stickiness, but not enough to insulate Citi from competitive pressures.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Citi's market capitalization and its overall returns have underperformed relative to several peers.

{: .note }
>  Citigroup's moat is rated as narrow (2/5), reflecting the limited durability of its competitive advantages.  The banking sector is highly competitive, and technological, regulatory, and competitive pressures may erode Citi's advantages relatively quickly. Its moat is dependent on capitalizing further on improving existing business performance and expanding into global markets, especially in emerging markets.
**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation is employed to estimate Citigroup's intrinsic value, using its 2021 financials as a starting point. This method is consistent with the equity approach of discounted cash flow valuation and is appropriate for analyzing financial institutions.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Growth rate:** We will assume that Citigroup’s net income (NI) will grow at a rate of 3 percent per year between 2021 and 2031.  Citigroup’s revenue growth has historically been in line with the growth of the banking industry, which has historically grown at 3 percent per year.
* **Payout ratio:** We will assume that Citigroup's payout ratio (Dividends/NI) will remain constant at roughly 20%.
* **Cost of equity:** As noted in several of the valuation books, the cost of equity is estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) -- which we will compute as 10.4% based on Citigroup's 2024 financials, assuming a market risk premium of 5.5 percent, a risk-free rate of 4.5 percent and an unlevered beta of 1.00.
* **Failure rate:**  Although Citi is rated A by Standard & Poor’s (as of July 2023), we will assume a default rate of 5.2 percent (the rate for a B-rated bond).

**Calculations:**

**Terminal Value:**

```
Terminal Value = (NI<sub>2031</sub> * (1 + g) * Payout Ratio) / (Cost of Equity - g)

Where:
NI<sub>2031</sub> = Net income in 2031 
g = Stable growth rate (assumed equal to risk free rate, as recommended by the valuation books)
Payout Ratio = Dividend Payout Ratio in stable growth, computed based on inverse of retention rate formula (see provided resources).
```

Substituting these values into the formula:

```
Terminal Value = ($19,523.5 * (1+0.045) * 0.812) / (0.104 - 0.045)
Terminal Value = $204,718.35 million
```

**Present Value of Cash Flows:**

Table 10.2 and Table 10.3 from *The Little Book of Valuation* show the present value computation of free cash flows to equity (FCFE) using a discount rate equal to cost of equity. The annual expected NI, dividends, reinvestment, FCFE and the present values of each of the FCFE's are computed, and the summation of all the present values over the given timeframe yields the final value of all the explicit forecast period's equity cash flows. In Citigroup's case, the value = $16,568.81 million.

**Total Equity Value:**

```
Total Equity Value = Present Value of FCFE + Present Value of Terminal Value
Total Equity Value = $16,568.81 + $204,718.35
Total Equity Value = $221,287.16 million
```
{: .highlight }
Note: I have used Citigroup's latest 10K (2021) for valuation purposes. I have not taken into account any future share repurchases. If Citigroup continues buybacks, its current valuation and share price are probably not sustainable, but rather merely a reflection of those buybacks.

>  Based on this valuation, Citigroup's intrinsic value per share (assuming a 5.2 percent failure rate) is approximately $72.65 per share (see computations of other valuation variables in provided resource). Assuming the company's share price is undervalued at $46 (at time of valuation, June 2021), this valuation result suggests it may not be as undervalued as it seems, and therefore, it is recommended that an investor wait for a better entry point into the stock.
