### Financial Analysis

**Revenue Growth:** Net sales increased 16.8% to $253.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $216.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Net sales increased 26.3% to $765.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $605.2 million for the same period last year.
{: .note }

 Net sales growth was driven by increasing awareness of the product, pricing actions, and the growth of Freshet Fridge locations.

**Gross Profit & Margins:** Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was $90.5 million, or 39.6% of net sales, compared to $72.9 million, or 33.6% of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Gross profit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $272.8 million compared to 180.9 million for the prior year. Gross profit margin has been increasing, as pricing actions have improved profitability, as well as increased sales.
{: .important }

This shows that Freshpet is able to gain more money from each sale of its products.
**Operating Expenses:** Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were $78.7 million, or 34.6% of net sales, compared to $61.6 million, or 28.4% of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2022. 
Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were $271.8 million compared to $221.5 million for the same period last year. These expenses are elevated as the company focuses on growth. The adjusted SG&A, as a % of net sales, was 38.4% in 2022 and 36.1% in 2023, so a positive trend is observed.
{: .note }

This shows that these expenses are growing slower than sales, leading to economies of scale.
**Income and Profitability:** Net income (loss) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was $11.1 million, compared to a net loss of $(7.8) million for the same period in the prior year. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the company posted a net income of $30.6 million compared to a net loss of $56.7 million for the prior year.
{: .important }

 This is a strong indicator that the company's financials are getting better. 
**Cash Flow:**  The cash flow from operating activities has become positive for Freshet at $39.9m for 2023. Capital expenditure remains elevated at $96m. Free cash flow remains in the negative but showing a positive trend.
**Balance Sheet:** Freshpet has $212.9 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023. Long-term debt outstanding is $339.7 million. However, this does not look like a big problem as the company is able to generate good revenue and profits from its operating activities.

### Moat Analysis
Based on the latest information, Freshpet's moat is assessed as follows:
*   **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Freshpet has built a strong brand, particularly within the fresh pet food category. While the company's marketing is effective, it's not clear if the brand commands the same price premium as certain leading consumer goods brands.
*   **Switching Costs:** The switching costs for pet food are low, especially compared to products like software. Consumers can easily switch from one brand to another with little friction, meaning there's low loyalty and pricing power of Freshpet.
*  **Network Effect:** The network effect is not a major component of a company selling pet food, but may impact the growth of specialized channels through which Freshpet sells its products. The more stores that distribute the brand, the more it benefits the company. This may be considered as a positive, but not substantial, advantage. 
*   **Cost Advantages:** It does not seem like Freshpet has large cost advantages at this time. The company is a high-quality food manufacturer, and this usually translates to higher input costs. The company focuses on the use of natural, human-grade ingredients which come at a premium. Therefore, we do not think they have a major cost advantage right now.
**Moat Rating:** The above analysis suggests that Freshpet is unlikely to have a wide moat. The company has a small advantage in intangible assets and some minor switching costs.
I give Freshpet a **2/5 rating** on the moat due to these factors.
    *   The company has had moderate success in its focus on making a specific category, but overall, the company struggles in its financials.

### Risks to Moat and Business Resilience

*   **Competitive Threats:** It is likely that competitors will continue to imitate Freshpet's models. The brand is also susceptible to marketing campaigns that can cause a shift in customer preferences.
*   **Supply Chain Issues:** Reliance on a limited number of suppliers or any issues with the supply chain may disrupt operations and increase costs.
*   **Changing Consumer Preferences:** The pet food industry is subject to changing preferences, and customers may prefer pet food that does not align with Freshet's strategy.
*   **Economic Downturns:** An economic downturn may affect consumer spending on premium products and reduce the company's revenues.
*  **High valuation, despite lack of profits:** The company's stock is expensive even after adjusting for growth, which is a potential downside risk.

{: .warning }

It is hard to justify a premium value without proven sustainability of returns on capital.

Despite these challenges, Freshpet's focus on a new segment and the ability to innovate give it a moderate resilience. It is also showing positive movement on profitability.

### Understandability:

While Freshpet's business model is based on something every consumer already knows, the financials are much harder to track, as well as their strategy. For this, I give a rating of **2 / 5.**

### Balance Sheet Health:

Freshpet is not in a perfect place when it comes to its balance sheet. Debt levels are somewhat high, however the company's financials are improving. For this, I give a rating of **3 / 5**.

### Recent Concerns/Controversies/Problems
In their latest conference call, they said that their revenues were lower than expected, which caused a sell off in the stock. They blame it on the macroeconomic slowdown and low demand, but also a bit of overstocking from competitors and lack of marketing from Freshpet itself. They have responded to this by taking steps to increase demand and reduce costs, such as cutting SG&A expenses.
{: .note }

While there are some concerns about short-term performance, they are taking steps to become more sustainable.
The long-term picture of the company is still positive, as it expands its brand and increases awareness of the importance of fresh pet food, while also improving internal efficiency.

They were also accused of misselling their products in the past, by not specifying clearly that the product must be stored in a fridge, however this lawsuit was settled in court.

### Overall Conclusion

Freshpet is trying to establish a dominant place in the fresh and refrigerated pet food market. Though the industry is on the rise, the company faces strong competition. It has shown some promise in its top and bottom line, however risks are apparent and must be closely watched before making any investment decision.
