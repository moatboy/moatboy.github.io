>The moat rating, management rating, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

> I consider a company's ability to increase prices, given inflation, and hold its profit margin on a relative basis a critically important characteristic from a long-term investment standpoint. That characteristic separates it from companies in the same industry or in related industries whose pricing policies fail to protect them against rising costs...It is only increased earnings in real terms that matters - increased dollar earnings merely mean that bigger sales in nominal terms.

This concept echoes the importance of sustainable excess returns on invested capital, the foundation of a moat, as detailed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

### Moat

**Rating: 3/5 (Narrow)**

JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive industry with a few large players dominating the market, including Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. Moats are not abundant in the financial services sector. However, JPMorgan Chase has built a narrow moat due primarily to several factors, discussed in the following subsections.

{: .important }
>
> In our experience at Morningstar, these four categories cover the vast majority of firms with moats, and using them as a filter will steer you in the right direction.
> 
> ---Pat Dorsey, *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*

**Intangible Assets:** JPMorgan Chase has intangible assets, including a trusted brand, giving it economies of scale and global reach, enabling it to build a deep pool of customers and clients, increasing the value of its network of branches.

{: .note }

This echoes the section of *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* about economic moats stemming from customer captivity, particularly network effects.

**Switching Costs:** In a few of JPM's business lines there are switching costs, including client trust and long-term relationships. In commercial banking, companies can be locked into JPM due to its global reach, which increases switching costs for businesses, similar to those of banks for retail customers. Switching financial services firms or wealth management can be seen by some as admitting they made a mistake in their original choice of a wealth manager, which creates a strong psychological barrier to switching.

{: .note }

This parallels the example in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* about the psychological barriers to switching.

**Regulation:** JPM benefits from regulation since banking and financial regulations have not changed drastically since the Glass-Steagall Act was repealed in the late 1990s.

**Scale Advantages:** While smaller, regional banks may not have access to investment-grade debt, JPM has a large amount of capital, allowing it to easily absorb any short-term funding shortfalls. Its high credit rating also provides regulatory and investor goodwill in a sector where goodwill and trust is paramount. 

{: .warning }

The largest risk to JPMorgan's moat is the potential for technological disruption or increased regulatory changes that could upend its current position as a leader in financial services.

### Management

**Rating: 3/5**

JPMorgan's management team, led by CEO Jamie Dimon, has a long and successful track record. However, they have also made some notable mistakes, including the 2012 "London Whale" trading loss, the 2020 Archegos Capital Management scandal, the 2021 Greensill Capital collapse, and the 2022 First Republic Bank acquisition.

{: .warning }
>
> So why is it that CEOs typically receive so much attention from investors? There are two reasons, one obvious and one insidious. The obvious one is that CEOs are an easy subject...The insidious reason that managers get so much attention as the arbiters of corporate fate is that we are all biased. It's inherent in human nature to want to tell stories and see patterns that may not actually exist—we feel better when we can identify the causal agent as a single person.
> 
> ---Pat Dorsey, *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*

**Positives:**

* **Long-Term Focus:** The management team generally demonstrates a long-term focus, as evidenced by its emphasis on building sustainable competitive advantages.
* **Effective Capital Allocation:** In the past, JPM’s management has effectively allocated capital. However, recent acquisitions like First Republic Bank may represent less effective capital allocation.
* **Strong Communication:**  JPMorgan has an open-door policy for shareholders, who can send their questions by mail.

**Negatives:**

* **Past Mistakes:** As described previously, there have been multiple financial missteps during the last decade.
* **Excessive Compensation:**  Jamie Dimon's compensation has been a source of controversy, with some arguing that it is excessive relative to the company's performance and the pay of other CEOs.
* **Insider Ownership:**  While insider ownership is not negligible, it is not exceptionally high relative to other companies in the S&P 500.

{: .important }
>
> Remember that while executive compensation and shareholder wealth creation have little correlation over one-year periods, there seems to be a stronger link over the longer term (10+ years), as the effects of individual managerial decisions are easier to isolate from the vagaries of company performance...Even more reassuringly, for those holding moats and buying those managed by responsible and skilled executives, is that their long-term track record gets far better.

### Business

JPMorgan Chase operates in a variety of businesses, each with its own distinct economic characteristics. 

**Consumer & Community Banking (CCB):** This segment provides a wide range of consumer financial services, including checking and savings accounts, mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. It faces competition from other large banks and fintech companies. Its moat is based on its large branch network, brand name, and technology. CCB constitutes about 44% of JPM’s total revenues. 

**Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB):** This segment provides investment banking services to corporations, governments, and other institutions. It is a highly cyclical business that is sensitive to capital markets and economic conditions. CIB is more exposed to market volatility and fluctuations than CCB, and constitutes about 37% of JPM's total revenues.

**Commercial Banking (CB):** This segment provides banking services to businesses, including lending, treasury services, and investment banking.  CB constitutes about 13% of JPM's total revenues. 

**Asset & Wealth Management (AWM):** This segment provides asset and wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and other clients.  AWM constitutes about 7% of JPM's total revenues.

> For many firms, the assumption that the firm’s profit margin will remain stable is a defensible one...For those firms, you have to start with revenue forecasts, estimate the changing operating margin, and then calculate free cash flow...

### Valuation

**Valuation: $151.7 Billion**

To value JPMorgan Chase, we will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.  We’ll value JPM’s four business segments separately and aggregate the results. To perform a valuation of JPMorgan Chase today, we will use historical data for JPM from 2018 through 2022 in its annual financial filings (10K). 

{: .important }
>
> The company's financial history, usually summarized in its financial statements. How fast have the revenues and earnings grown over time? What can we learn about cost structure and profitability from these trends? Susceptibility to micro or economic factors and recession and cyclical firms.
> 
> ---Aswath Damodaran, *The Little Book of Valuation*

**Step 1.  Project Key Financial Drivers**

The key value drivers for any company are revenue growth, operating margin, tax rate, reinvestment rate and WACC. We will use a five-year period for the specific projections, followed by the stable-growth period for the continuing value. 

{: .important }
>
> A good model combines 15 years of financials with five years of detailed forecasts and moves smoothly from a explicit to an implicit phase in its approach to valuing companies.
> 
> ---McKinsey & Company, *Valuation*

{: .note }

This structure is consistent with the methodology outlined in *Valuation*.

**Revenue and Margin Assumptions:**

For all four of JPM’s businesses, there seems to be a consensus that the high revenue growth of the last decade, fueled in part by the economic expansion, is unlikely to continue in the foreseeable future, as JPM is already a leader in financial services. For our base case, we have assumed revenue growth of 3.5 percent per year. Also, we anticipate a continued modest increase in profit margins during the explicit period and stable operating margins in stable growth.


{: .note }

This rate is consistent with long-term economic growth in the U.S.

**Reinvestment and WACC Assumptions:**
We will assume that revenue-growth rate will continue with a modest but substantial amount of capital required. This is reflected in an estimated reinvestment rate of 40 percent. Based on the company’s credit rating (AA-) we estimate JPM’s cost of capital to be 8.5 percent, assuming an industry-standard market risk premium of 5.5 percent. 

{: .important }

> You should consider the risk associated with future returns in making most investment decisions. The notion that some investments are risk-free because the U.S. government underwrites the ultimate solvency of banking institutions is one for which investors will be paying dearly someday.
> 
> ---Kenneth L. Fisher, *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*

**Terminal Value:**
To estimate the terminal value, we will use the perpetuity growth method, assuming that the company’s profit margin will remain stable after the explicit forecasting period. We assume a growth rate of 2 percent, roughly equal to the inflation rate, and a reinvestment rate of 20 percent to arrive at a continuing value at year 10.


**Step 2. Complete DCF Valuation**

The resulting DCF value of the company’s operations are summarized in Table 1.


| Business Segment             | Value of Operations ($ Billions) |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Consumer and Community Banking | $73.9                              |
| Corporate and Investment Bank   | $53.9                              |
| Commercial Banking            | $14.4                              |
| Asset and Wealth Management   | $9.5                              |
| Total                       | $151.7                            |



{: .warning }

All estimates are highly uncertain and should be used with caution. 


### Discussion

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

JPMorgan Chase has faced several challenges in recent years, including:

* **Regulatory Scrutiny:** JPM has been under increased regulatory scrutiny following the 2008 financial crisis. It has paid billions of dollars in fines and settlements related to a variety of issues, including mortgage-backed securities, market manipulation, and money laundering.
{: .important }

    > So if you're asking, Louis, for the next year or so, can we have a solid foundation for making smart investment decisions. I wish you well.
    >
    > ---Jeremy Barnum, CFO and Chief Financial Officer of JPMorgan Chase, Q2 2023 Earnings Call.
* **Competition:** JPM faces intense competition from other large banks, as well as from new entrants in the financial services sector, such as fintech companies.
{: .important }
>
    > So look, as I said, like we are seeing some new competitors, particularly in consumer and small business, but they're small and we're not seeing big structural changes that affect sort of our core business.
    >
    > ---Jeremy Barnum, CFO and Chief Financial Officer of JPMorgan Chase, Q2 2023 Earnings Call.
* **Economic Uncertainty:**  The global economic outlook is uncertain, and this could negatively impact JPM's business.

**Potential Catalysts:**

Several potential catalysts could drive JPMorgan Chase's share price higher in the coming years, including:

* **Improved Profitability:** JPM has the potential to improve its profitability through cost-cutting measures and revenue growth.
{: .important }
>
    > But what we're really seeing, in fact, is that the very strong secular drivers that are affecting the rest of the economy are really driving this industry growth.
    >
    > ---Jeremy Barnum, CFO and Chief Financial Officer of JPMorgan Chase, Q2 2023 Earnings Call.
* **Acquisitions:**  JPM has a history of making acquisitions, and it could continue to acquire smaller companies to expand its business.
* **Share Repurchases:** JPMorgan has been repurchasing its shares, and this could continue to support the share price.

**Additional Notes:**

* JPMorgan Chase is a complex company, and its valuation is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
* Investors should be cautious about using the DCF valuation as the sole basis for making investment decisions.
* Investors should also consider other factors, such as the company's competitive landscape, management team, and regulatory environment.
* There is a significant amount of information on JPM and many of its peers in *Measuring the Moat*, and it is highly relevant in analyzing the industry of financial services and banking, which may lead the reader to some helpful conclusions.
