>The moat, understandability, and balance sheet health scores reflect a conservative evaluation to ensure a margin of safety in any assessment.



{: .highlight }
LCI Industries' business model is primarily selling its components to RV manufacturers. This makes the business dependent on trends in the RV and leisure industry. A slowdown in the RV industry could directly impact the sales of the company.

### Business Overview
LCI Industries operates through two main segments: Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Aftermarket. The OEM segment primarily involves manufacturing and selling components directly to RV, manufactured housing, and other OEM manufacturers. The aftermarket segment involves selling parts and components directly to distributors and retailers for repair and upgrade in those industries.

{: .important }
The RV industry, which constitutes a significant part of LCI's business, has experienced robust growth in recent years, fueled by a shift towards outdoor lifestyle and increased recreational spending. However, the industry is also known for its cyclicality, experiencing boom-and-bust cycles along with market dynamics.

#### Revenue Distribution
*   **OEM Segment:** This segment is the larger of the two, accounting for a significant portion of the company’s total sales. It includes parts and components used for new vehicles.
*   **Aftermarket Segment:** This segment is smaller, but growing and more profitable segment, encompassing parts, equipment and accessories that are sold through dealerships and retail channels for repair and upgrade.

{: .note }
A crucial part of LCI’s business is the OEM side. The company focuses primarily on selling to manufacturers of RVs rather than retail, making trends in that industry of vital importance.

#### Competitive Landscape

*   The company faces competition from other component suppliers, as well as from the internal manufacturing operations of some of its larger customers.
*   While LCI has built a considerable presence, it operates in a fragmented industry where no one company has a dominant market share.
*   Its competitive advantages are scale-based and depend heavily on maintaining good business relations with large customers. 

#### What Makes LCI Different

*   **Vertical Integration**: LCI has invested significantly in vertical integration, which allows it to control more of the manufacturing process, reducing its dependency on outside suppliers and improving supply chain efficiency. This approach should lead to lower costs over the long term. 
*   **Innovation**: LCI has been focused on product innovation, particularly in the realm of digitization. They’ve also been focused on more comfortable living experiences in their products to enhance the value proposition.
*   **Focus on the RV Industry**: While it also operates in adjacent industries, LCI has positioned itself as a strong leader in the RV industry. The experience, relationships and data they have built for the RV industry make them more relevant to customers and this is difficult to replicate quickly.

### Financials
LCI's financial performance is closely linked to the cyclicality of the RV and other related industries. Here are the key points from the latest reports:

*   **Revenue**: LCI's revenue is affected by the fluctuations in RV production, which directly affects the OEM segment. The aftermarket segment, while being a smaller portion of the company's business, provides a bit of stability. While overall revenue is trending up, the company faces periods of volatility.
*   **Profitability**: LCI's profits vary in each quarter, but have trended toward increases. Operating margins have typically been between 10-12%, depending on various factors such as operating costs, material cost fluctuations, and productivity levels. While prices have shown some increase, cost inflation of materials has been a limiting factor.
*   **Cash Flows**: The company has a positive cash flow from operations, which allows to continue investing in their business and acquisitions. It is important to note that there can be seasonal swings. The company has demonstrated a good history of handling its working capital well. 
*   **Capital Expenditures**: capex have increased substantially over the last few years, to keep pace with changing production demand and upgrade existing facilities and equipment. As a result, returns on invested capital has seen declines.
*   **Balance Sheet**: The balance sheet for LCI Industries is healthy, with a solid current ratio. The leverage levels of the company are stable for now, as a result of debt repayment plans. They had cash of $469 million at the end of last quarter.
*    **Dividends**: Company is committed to its dividend policy and have seen significant growth in the dividend over the last few years, which implies higher income for investors.

{: .important }
As you’ll see in the financials above, there has been a noticeable impact on both the revenue and cost side by the macroeconomic environment, interest rate hikes and inflationary pressures. This impacts their margins as well, where they need to balance passing increased costs onto consumers, and maintaining competitiveness.

### Moat Assessment: 2/5
LCI Industries’ moat is weak, based on the following evaluation:

*   **Brand Identity (Weak Moat):** While they have a recognized presence in the RV sector, they don't have consumer-facing brand power to create premium pricing capabilities over their competition.
*   **Switching Costs (Weak Moat):** While LCI attempts to create integration and customization for its clients, the switching costs are not especially high as it’s an overall fragmented market with multiple suppliers.
*   **Economies of Scale (Moderate Moat):** LCI benefits from economies of scale through large-scale production and distribution, which enables them to offer low costs. However, that is easily copied.
*   **Intangible Assets (Weak Moat):** The company benefits from some patents on product innovations but it’s a fast-paced industry where new technologies arise very quickly, thus limiting the ability for patents to be a strong moat.

### Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience

*   **Cyclicality of RV and Housing Industries:** A slowdown in these industries significantly impacts the demand for LCI components.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Reliance on key suppliers, particularly given recent turmoil in supply chain logistics, exposes the business to risks of disruptions and cost inflation.
*   **Competition from OEMs:** Some larger RV manufacturers are able to produce some parts of the vehicles internally which poses a direct threat to LCI.
*   **Acquisition Integration:** LCI has been very acquisitive. There’s a chance that this could be detrimental if those companies are not incorporated well, or if the overall strategy of acquisitions is harmful.
*   **High debt and interest rate increases.** While LCI has focused on reducing debt, it is still a consideration in this environment with higher interest rates.

Despite these risks, LCI shows resilience through:

*   **Diversification:** LCI mitigates market concentration through expansion into different industries.
*   **Operational Improvements:** The company continuously focuses on improving productivity, margins, and cost management to reduce financial impact from temporary economic downturns. 

### Understandability: 3/5
The business model is not complicated, but not very straightforward either. The company produces parts that are used by other manufacturers. There are some things that one needs to know to understand the company better. 

### Balance Sheet Health: 4/5
The balance sheet is healthy and relatively stable. The company has good liquidity and has managed its debt well, but higher interest rates in the future might become a threat.
