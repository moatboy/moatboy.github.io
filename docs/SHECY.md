>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Hershey benefits primarily from its brand recognition in the chocolate and candy market.  As discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, intangible assets like brands can create durable competitive advantages.  However, a well-known brand does not automatically translate into a wide moat. As Dorsey explains, the key question is whether the brand allows a company to charge a premium relative to similar competing products.  While Hershey can command a slight premium in some categories, this pricing power is not as absolute as some other consumer staples companies.  The emergence of private label brands and smaller, innovative competitors, as mentioned in the provided articles, continually erodes Hershey’s pricing power. Also, as we’ll see later, Hershey’s relatively high advertising spending, while helping maintain its brand, also weighs on margins and returns on capital.  This, in turn, constrains its moat.  Therefore, given the information provided, I’ve assigned Hershey a narrow moat rating of 2.

**Management (3/5):**

While Hershey's management team has generally been competent, some concerns justify a more conservative rating.

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** Management's focus on acquisitions to drive growth, as revealed in recent earnings calls, raises concerns.  Acquisitions, as discussed extensively in McKinsey & Company's *Valuation*, often destroy value for the acquirer due to overpayment and integration challenges. Hershey’s acquisition of Amplify Snack Brands (2017) and Pirate Brands (2018), for example, have not translated into significantly higher profit growth in recent years, thereby increasing the likelihood that these acquisitions were value-destroying.
* **Communication:**  Management's communication during earnings calls tends to emphasize short-term results, which, as illustrated by Michael Burry’s investment philosophy, can lead investors to make short-term decisions that ultimately damage their long-term investment performance.
* **Compensation:** I lack specific information on executive compensation but will assume it is a market-based system. As illustrated in Warren Buffett's shareholder letters, such market-based systems frequently encourage maximizing reported earnings, thereby diverting the executive’s focus from maximizing shareholder value. 
* **Insider Ownership:** While insider ownership exists, it is relatively small. I lack data to make an informed decision about whether that share is significantly below average for the sector.

Given these concerns, it’s prudent to give a conservative management rating of 3/5.

**Business and Financials:**

* **Revenues Distribution:**  Hershey generates the bulk of its revenue from chocolate and snack products, with North America being its dominant geographic market. As discussed in the earnings call for the second quarter of 2020, the company has been trying to expand its international presence, though its progress has been slow.
* **Industry Trends:** The confectionery industry is mature and highly competitive.  The emergence of smaller, niche brands, as well as the continued strength of private label products, creates a challenging operating environment for Hershey.
* **Margins:** Hershey’s margins are above average for its industry but under pressure from rising input costs and the need to invest heavily in advertising to maintain its brand.  This pressure on margins is reflected in its returns on invested capital which, as we’ll see in the next section, are not particularly high relative to the cost of capital.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Hershey faces intense competition from Mars Wrigley, Mondelez, and numerous smaller players. The retail landscape, dominated by powerful players like Walmart, also increases bargaining pressure.


**Financials In-Depth:**

| Metric                       | 2018  | 2019  | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |
|-------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Revenue ($ billions)         | 7.79  | 8.01  | 8.15  | 8.97  | 9.73 |
| Net Income ($ millions)      | 1,168 | 1,141 | 1,173 | 1,472 | 1,574 |
| Return on Invested Capital | 17%    | 16%    | 15%    | 16%   | 17%   |

Hershey's returns on invested capital are not particularly high and, as mentioned earlier, somewhat concerning given their competitive landscape.

**Valuation ($1.15 billion):**

{: .note }
>
> All dollar amounts are in billions unless otherwise noted.

I am using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value Hershey, assuming a reinvestment rate of 10% and cost of capital of 9%. A 15-year explicit forecast period will be used, with years one through five being calculated in detail and the remaining years using the overview (streamlined) method, and a terminal value. Given that revenue growth rates, margins, and returns on capital are difficult to measure precisely, especially in highly competitive sectors, I will assume Hershey can grow its revenue by 2% over the next five years, holding gross margins stable at approximately 44%, and achieving operating margins of 20%, and that Hershey has a return on new invested capital of 10%. After the fifth year, the perpetuity growth rate is estimated at 2%. 

{: .highlight }


| Year | FCF  | PV   |
|------|------|------|
| 1    | 1.42 | 1.34 |
| 2    | 1.47 | 1.27 |
| 3    | 1.52 | 1.20 |
| 4    | 1.57 | 1.14 |
| 5    | 1.62 | 1.08 |
| Terminal Value    | 49.15| 27.08 |



Total present value of operating assets = $32.11 billion. Debt on balance sheet = $3.65. Cash balance = $1.53. Value of operating assets + Cash = $33.64 billion. Subtract out Debt = $29.99 billion. Assuming outstanding share count of 408.66 million, this suggests a fair value of $73.36 per share.  At a trading price of $206, and even after accounting for margin of safety, this seems significantly overvalued.
Hershey’s revenue growth rate over the last five years has averaged a paltry 2.1% annually.
**Catalysts (2/5):**

* **International Expansion:**  Success in expanding into new markets could drive revenue growth.  However, given the competition in international markets, this is not a guaranteed catalyst. 
* **Product Innovation:**  New product launches could boost sales, but again, given the competition and quick imitation in this market, the ability for the products to create durable competitive advantage seems unlikely.

Given the limited visibility of these catalysts and the intense competition Hershey faces, a catalyst rating of 2 is appropriate.

**Recent Concerns and Problems:**

Recent earnings calls and articles reveal that Hershey has faced increasing competition and margin pressure due to rising input costs. Management is also betting on acquisitions, which, as already mentioned, often end up destroying value. The company has also been affected by COVID-related disruptions to consumer buying patterns.

**Michael Burry’s Philosophy and Inspiration:**

Michael Burry's investment philosophy, as illustrated in the provided journal entries, emphasizes deep fundamental analysis and finding undervalued companies based on intrinsic value. He looks for situations where the market has mispriced a company based on short-term factors and looks for bargains.  This approach is consistent with the core principles espoused in both *The Intelligent Investor* and *Valuation*.  Burry emphasizes careful analysis of financial statements, a focus on cash flow, and a willingness to go against the crowd. He isn't afraid to bet on cyclical businesses if the fundamentals are sound, and he is particularly focused on companies and sectors that he understands fully.  This disciplined approach should serve as inspiration when evaluating any company, including Hershey, for potential investment.  His detailed record of his rationale and valuation, with specific calculations, is a model for thorough analysis.  We should take to heart his emphasis on understanding the business before looking at the numbers.
