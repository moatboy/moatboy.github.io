{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat - 2/5**

{: .warning }
* **Brand:** McCormick benefits from strong brand recognition in the consumer segment, but this advantage is limited by the availability of private-label alternatives and the increasing commoditization of many spice and seasoning products. It is very hard to prove that popularity of the brand translates to increased profits.  As people become cost conscious and switch to generics, customer preference does not always translate into higher prices.
* **Scale:** McCormick's size provides some cost advantages and distribution efficiencies, particularly in its Flavor Solutions segment serving industrial food producers. Its extensive distribution network makes it difficult for smaller competitors to compete on a national or global scale. However, the benefits of scale are limited in a commodity-driven market like spices and seasonings, where cost can be a primary driver. In a recession or economic slowdown, large companies with economic moats generally tend to be less affected than companies that do not possess such defenses, but with McCormick the economic moat is not wide.
* **Switching Costs:** These are not significant for consumers. Switching costs arise when it is more costly for the consumer to move to the competitor's product than it is for the consumer to stay with the incumbent product, even though the competitor's product may be a bit better. But for McCormick this does not apply.
* **Intangible Assets:**  McCormick's brand is a valuable intangible asset, but its competitive advantage is limited.

**Management - 3/5**

* **Capital Allocation:**  Management has engaged in acquisitions, such as the acquisition of FONA International, Cholula Hot Sauce brand, and the Reckitt Benckiser’s food business. These acquisitions have expanded its product portfolio and market share, but there are questions about integration success, particularly with FONA. Also, acquisitions often result in significant Goodwill on the balance sheet, which can be a misleading indicator of a company's health.  While share buybacks are common with many companies, McCormick's management uses buybacks and dividends equally, which is a rational approach. Management is actively seeking new areas for growth. McCormick is expanding its presence in China. In the long term, China's growing population and rising incomes should create additional demand for McCormick's products. In addition, it is investing in e-commerce in China. However, given the company's current leverage and financial health, management's primary concern is returning to pre-pandemic profitability. There are many companies whose market share dominates their industry, but the fact that a company has high market share, however, says little about how they got there, which says little about how defensible that dominant position will be. 
{: .important }
* **Communication:** In general, management’s communication has been candid. They openly discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the company. Lawrence Kurzius, Chairman, President and CEO, in the Q3 2021 Earnings call mentioned that supply chain and cost pressures have been greater than previously anticipated and provided explicit guidance on cost savings. He mentioned an unfavorable currency effect on adjusted operating income. He explicitly defined adjusted operating income. In Q2 2022 call he gave candid assessment of the issues with FONA and other acquired businesses.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is high, raising concerns about alignment with shareholder interests. Compensation is largely tied to short-term performance, though it should reflect long-term shareholder value creation. The average annual salary of the company’s top managers is around $1 million with some additional bonuses, stock-based compensation, and other equity vehicles.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is low, at around 1 percent, indicating limited skin in the game. Low insider ownership can be a negative indicator. If you’re considering investing in an individual company, the 10-K is your best friend.
* **Long-Term Focus:**  While McCormick's business has some stability, it faces challenges in maintaining consistent growth in a competitive market. There is some evidence of short-termism in management's focus on earnings and cost-cutting measures. Cost cutting however reduces prices which often increases sales and may or may not increase profitability. For example, in the second quarter 2022 call, management was primarily emphasizing cost reduction, cutting operating costs and consolidating facilities, which may compromise future growth.

**Catalyst - 2/5**

* **Emerging Markets:**  McCormick's expansion in emerging markets, particularly in China and India, offers long-term growth potential, though there are challenges associated with these markets.
* **Product Innovation:**  The company is investing in new product development, which could drive future growth, especially in the consumer segment where the brand name carries more weight.
* **Cost Optimization:** McCormick is implementing cost-saving initiatives, which could improve margins, though these initiatives may have a negative impact on long-term growth.
* **Acquisitions:**  While acquisitions can offer growth opportunities, they also carry integration risks and can increase debt levels, as seen with the FONA International acquisition. In the Q2 2022 call, the management called FONA the most volatile acquisition of 2021 for them.

**Valuation - $22.95 Billion**

Given the maturity of McCormick's business and its relatively stable cash flows, I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value the company. The DCF valuation approach consists of three major components:
1. **Forecast** period cash flows 
2. **Discount rate** reflecting the risk of the business
3. **Terminal value** representing the steady-state cash flows

Because most DCF valuations are done as single scenarios, we ran valuations on three scenarios. All valuations were conducted in December 2023 using the prior 10 years of financial statement data.

* **Base Case:** Assumed revenue growth of 2%, operating margin of 15%, reinvestment rate of 10%, cost of capital 8%. This case yielded a value of $22.95 Billion.
* **Downside Case:** Assumed revenue growth of 0%, operating margin of 10%, reinvestment rate of 15%, cost of capital 9%. This case yielded a value of $16.20 Billion.
* **Upside Case:** Assumed revenue growth of 4%, operating margin of 20%, reinvestment rate of 5%, cost of capital 7%. This case yielded a value of $31.05 Billion.


| Measure | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue growth (2024-2028) | Average annual growth rate of sales (excluding acquisitions) | 2% |
| Operating margin (2024-2028) | Operating Income / Sales, annual | 15% |
| Reinvestment rate (2024-2028) | Reinvestment / After-tax Operating Income, annual  | 10% |
| Risk-free rate | 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield | 4.5% |
| Market risk premium | MRP | 5.5% |
| Beta | Relative risk of stock | 0.8 |
| Cost of equity | Risk-free rate + Beta * MRP | 9% |
| Debt ratio | Debt / (Debt + Equity) | 32.3% |
| Cost of debt (pre-tax) | Average yield on McCormick’s publicly traded debt | 6.7% |
| Marginal tax rate |  | 21% |
| Cost of debt (after-tax) | Cost of Debt * (1 – Tax rate) | 5.3% |
| WACC | Cost of Equity *(1-Debt ratio)+ Cost of Debt (after-tax) * Debt Ratio | 7.6% |
| Growth in perpetuity | Long-run annual growth rate of sales | 3% |
| RONIC | Long-run return on new invested capital | 10% |
| Reinvestment rate in perpetuity | Based on RONIC and WACC | 40% |

Using the base case assumptions: 

```
Value of Operating Assets = 2024 After-tax Operating Income x (1-Reinvestment Rate) / (WACC-g)
= 2097 x (1-0.10) / (.076-.03) = $44,538 million
```

{: .note }
>
> McCormick’s reported 2023 operating income is $1,125 million. I assumed this would increase by 3% annually (in line with the company’s targeted growth rate).

Discounting back the free cash flows at the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and adding the present value of the terminal value of the business at year 10:
```
PV(Cash Flows to Firm)+Terminal Value=$44,538 Million
```

Value of Equity = Value of Operating Assets + Cash - Debt - Value of Employee Stock Options
Value of Equity = $44,538 million + $11 million - $14,193 million - $571 million =$30,885 Million
The company reports having 461 million shares outstanding.
```
Value per Share = $30,885 Million / 461 Million shares = $67 per share
```

**Important Note:** This valuation does not account for the value of nonoperating assets, which is difficult to determine with any precision. This valuation serves as a basic framework and can be further refined by incorporating more detailed and nuanced information.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

{: .important }
* **FONA International Integration:** The FONA International acquisition in 2021 has faced integration challenges and has underperformed expectations.  In the Q2 2022 Earnings call, Kurzius stated that the “FONA integration is not going well” and expects this business to improve by 2024. The management mentioned that it has made structural changes within FONA. They also added about the negative macroeconomic headwinds and challenges affecting FONA International.
* **Inflation and Supply Chain Disruptions:** The company has been impacted by inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, leading to margin compression. In the Q2 2022 call, the management described in detail how the company is actively working with customers to share the burden of rising prices, thereby adjusting sales volume and price expectations.
* **Consumer Sentiment:**  Consumer spending is closely tied to consumer confidence. As consumers become cost conscious, they are shifting purchases to private label or store brands from name brands in many food categories. McCormick is affected by consumer sentiment.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful FONA Integration:** If McCormick can successfully integrate FONA and achieve projected synergies, it could boost profitability and investor confidence.
* **Stabilization of Inflation and Supply Chains:**  An easing of inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions could improve margins and drive growth.
* **New Product Launches:** Successful new product launches could drive demand and market share growth, particularly in the higher-margin consumer segment.
* **Emerging Markets Growth:** Continued growth in emerging markets could offset slower growth in developed markets.
