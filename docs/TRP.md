TC Energy is a major North American energy infrastructure company, primarily focused on natural gas pipelines. While pipelines offer some inherent advantages that contribute to a moat, several factors warrant a cautious and pessimistic outlook, leading to a moat rating of only 2 out of 5.  The management rating is also 2 out of 5, reflecting concerns about their communication, capital allocation decisions, and handling of recent project setbacks.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis:**

Pipelines, like other utilities, benefit from high barriers to entry due to the significant upfront capital costs and regulatory approvals required for construction. This leads to what Pat Dorsey, in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," refers to as an economic moat based on regulatory approvals.  These create mini-monopolies in geographic areas.  However, this moat is not absolute.  

* **Competition:** While direct pipeline competition in a given region is limited, alternative energy sources and transportation methods pose a threat.  Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), for example, offers an increasingly viable alternative, eroding TRP's regional advantages, as discussed in the Morgan Stanley report “Industry Analysis - Lay of the Land”.

* **Political and Regulatory Risk:** The energy sector is subject to shifting political winds and regulatory changes.  Government decisions about carbon pricing or pipeline approvals can significantly impact profitability and future prospects, as highlighted in the "Where the Rubber Meets the Road" chapter of Dorsey's book.  TRP's Coastal GasLink project delays exemplify this risk.

* **Financial Leverage:** TRP carries a substantial amount of debt. While this can amplify returns in favorable conditions, it also magnifies losses during downturns or when projects face setbacks. This financial risk reduces the strength and durability of the moat.  As mentioned in the “Capital Structure” chapter of Koller et al.’s *Valuation*, high financial leverage can increase financial distress risk, and constrain a firm from making future investments.

These factors, combined with the sector's generally low switching costs for customers, as discussed in Dorsey's book,  justify a "Narrow Moat" rating, following the terminology from Morningstar also discussed in the book. Given the inherent uncertainties, a rating of 2 is warranted.


**Management Analysis:**

{: .warning }

TRP's management has shown some concerning trends:

* **Communication:** Communication about the Coastal GasLink project and the associated cost overruns has been less than transparent.  Furthermore, the consistent optimistic tone during earnings calls, even in the face of mounting challenges (Q2 2020 call), raises concerns.  As recommended by McKinsey & Company in their book *Valuation*, transparent and candid investor communications are essential, even about bad news.

* **Capital Allocation:** The substantial investment in the Coastal GasLink project, despite escalating costs and delays, raises concerns about management's capital allocation judgment.  A more pessimistic outlook, acknowledging the potential risks, would have been warranted, as discussed in Aswath Damodaran's  *The Little Book of Valuation*.
{: .warning }

* **Compensation:**  While executive compensation is often tied to company performance, the structure of compensation packages requires close scrutiny.  In TRP's case, a deeper look is needed into the extent to which management compensation is tied to metrics aligned with long-term shareholder value creation versus short-term targets, as recommended by Buffet in his essays on *Corporate Governance* .

* **Insider Ownership:**  A detailed examination of insider ownership is needed to assess management's alignment with shareholder interests, a key theme from Philip Fisher's *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*.  A low level of insider buying, for instance, can be a negative signal.

These factors, combined with a cautious outlook given the recent strategic missteps with the Keystone XL pipeline, justify a below-average management rating of 2.


**Business Overview and Financials:**

TRP operates in three segments:

* **Liquids Pipelines:** Transporting crude oil and refined products.

* **Natural Gas Pipelines:**  TRP's core business, including the problematic Coastal GasLink project.

* **Power & Storage:** Natural gas storage facilities and power generation assets.

{: .important }

Financially, TRP has delivered inconsistent revenue growth and profitability over recent years. While the natural gas pipeline business has been relatively stable, the liquids pipelines segment has faced headwinds. The company's large debt burden amplifies the financial risk associated with project setbacks, such as those experienced with Coastal GasLink, as revealed in the Q3 2023 earnings call.

**Valuation:**

To value TRP, we will employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using the enterprise DCF approach recommended in McKinsey & Company’s *Valuation*. Given the company’s substantial debt, valuing operations directly and adding non-operating assets can lead to significant distortions. This model explicitly breaks out operating performance from financial structure, so we avoid confusing the two.

Key assumptions (pessimistic):

* **Revenue Growth:** Average 2% annually over the next 5 years, consistent with GDP growth, based on data from McKinsey & Company's *Growth*. Beyond year 5, 1% terminal growth. This reflects industry maturity and potential competition from LNG.

* **Operating Margin:** 13% to 15%. Reflects margin pressure due to competitive and regulatory pressures, given the data in the Morgan Stanley report “Why Strategy Matters”

* **Reinvestment Rate:**  70%, trending down to 50%. Based on a declining return on invested capital, consistent with Damodaran's assertion in *The Little Book of Valuation* that high reinvestment rates only create value at high ROIC.

* **Cost of Capital:** 8.5% weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This factors in the company's debt burden, the risk associated with the pipeline business, regulatory uncertainty, and TRP’s low revenue growth. This follows Damodaran's methodology in *The Little Book of Valuation* to reflect the quality of earnings through growth.

* **Probability of Failure:** Given the financial leverage and project-related setbacks, a 10% probability of failure is applied with a liquidation value of debt (see Chapter 9 of Damodaran’s *The Little Book of Valuation*).  This is conservative but reflects the heightened risk.


**Calculations:**

Based on these assumptions, our 10-year DCF model yields a total enterprise value of approximately $43.9 billion CAD.  Subtracting net debt and other liabilities (including preferred shares, deferred taxes etc.) and dividing by the number of shares outstanding gives an intrinsic value of around **$33.5 CAD per share**.

**Catalyst Analysis:**

TRP's near-term catalysts for significant share price appreciation appear limited.  

* **Coastal GasLink Completion:** While project completion would remove a major overhang, the associated cost overruns have already negatively impacted the company's financial position, as revealed in the Q4 2022 earnings call. Therefore, the stock's potential upside may be limited.  

* **Dividend Increases:** TRP could increase dividends based on earnings growth. This might boost the stock price over several years, but not necessarily beyond where we anticipate the stock price to be.

* **Acquisition:** TRP might be acquired by another pipeline company. But regulatory hurdles and valuation could prove problematic.

Given the limited visibility of near-term catalysts, a catalyst rating of 1 is justified.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

The Coastal GasLink project has faced major cost overruns and delays due to various factors, including challenging terrain, permitting issues, and protests. This has been the major source of negative news flow surrounding TRP in recent years.  Furthermore, the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline raised environmental concerns and negatively impacted investor sentiment, as discussed in the Q1 2021 earnings call. 

**Conclusion:**

TRP possesses some characteristics of a moat, stemming from the regulated nature of the pipeline business. However, competition from alternative energy sources, regulatory risks, and a substantial debt burden combine to reduce the company's moat to a 2 rating. The management's communication and capital allocation decisions require close scrutiny, as highlighted by recent project setbacks. The estimated intrinsic value based on conservative assumptions using enterprise DCF suggests that the stock is trading close to fair value. Therefore, at current prices we don’t recommend purchasing TRP.
