{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Erie possesses a narrow moat stemming primarily from high customer retention rates.  The company's focus on local agents fosters personal relationships and tailored service, creating switching costs for customers. This is a recognizable albeit modest form of competitive advantage, in line with Pat Dorsey's description of switching costs as a source of economic moats in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. However, the competitive pressures and availability of alternative insurance providers prevent a higher moat rating.  Furthermore, the company's geographical concentration increases its vulnerability to localized economic downturns and catastrophic events.  

**Management (3/5):**

Management's historical performance is generally good, demonstrating a capacity for prudent underwriting and stable profitability. They have also communicated effectively with shareholders, exhibiting transparency in their financial reporting. However, their conservative approach to growth, primarily through organic expansion, may limit their ability to fully capitalize on market opportunities, as suggested in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company. Moreover, their recent foray into new geographies and product lines may be a test of their management depth and adaptability.  Their compensation levels appear reasonable, and insider ownership is a positive but not exceptional signal.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for share price appreciation include increased market share in newer geographies, successful integration of recent acquisitions, and improved operational efficiencies leading to higher margins. The development of innovative products and services could also drive growth and profitability. However, the competitive nature of the insurance industry and macroeconomic headwinds temper the catalyst rating.

>**Q3 2023 Earnings Call:** Management highlighted the company's strong financial performance and reaffirmed its commitment to organic growth and geographic expansion. The company has also made several acquisitions to diversify further and improve its performance (such as the recent acquisition of the Erie Family Life Insurance Company). It also discussed some of the challenges faced by the industry due to the rising interest rates and inflation.  

**Valuation ($13.5 billion):**

>**Valuation Methodology:** We will primarily use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, specifically the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) approach, as discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation*, because it focuses directly on the cash flows available to equity investors. Given Erie's stable financial history and mature business model, a DCF is appropriate for valuation. A second valuation will be conducted by taking the current P/B and using the return on equity and growth rate as we discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation*. Finally, comparison using relative valuation will be conducted.
A conservative, or pessimistic, view will be taken in the projections, reflecting the competitive landscape and macroeconomic uncertainties.

**Inputs and Calculations:**

> 1. **Estimate Historical Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** We will start by estimating free cash flow to equity by using historical data from past years available from the annual reports (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023). The process of computing FCFE from reported net income is explained in detail in *Valuation* by Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels.  (See included tables below).
> 2. **Forecast Revenue Growth Rate:** Based on historical growth trends and management's commentary, we will project revenue growth at a rate of 4 percent annually for the next 10 years. This is below average historical levels and reflects economic uncertainty. Note that recent growth rate and forecasts are available in Erie's annual and quarterly reports. This can be justified based on the projected growth in the consumer product & service market presented in the *Counterpoint Global Insights* report provided by Morgan Stanley.
> 3. **Forecast Operating Margin:** We project operating margins will gradually decline to 11 percent over the next 10 years, reflecting increased competitive pressures. This is lower than current margins.
> 4. **Forecast Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 22 percent.  This is derived from historical capital expenditures and working capital needs.
> 5. **Estimate Cost of Equity:**  We'll use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), as recommended in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*. Risk-Free Rate: 4.0%; Equity Risk Premium: 4.5%; Beta: 0.9 (based on historical market data). We obtain an implied cost of equity of 8.05%.
> 6. **Terminal Value:** We calculate the terminal value using the perpetuity growth method, assuming a long-term growth rate of 3 percent, consistent with long-run inflation expectations. The present value of this terminal value forms a substantial portion of the firm's total value.
> 7. **Discount FCFE:** We discount the projected FCFE and terminal value at the cost of equity to arrive at the present value of the equity.  These values are summarized in the included table below.

**FCFE Valuation Summary:**

| Year | FCFE ($ millions) | Discount Factor | Present Value ($ millions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $443 | 0.926 | $410 |
| 2 | $462 | 0.857 | $396 |
| 3 | $482 | 0.794 | $383 |
| 4 | $503 | 0.735 | $370 |
| 5 | $526 | 0.681 | $358 |
| 6 | $549 | 0.630 | $346 |
| 7 | $574 | 0.584 | $334 |
| 8 | $599 | 0.540 | $324 |
| 9 | $626 | 0.500 | $313 |
| 10 | $653 | 0.463 | $303 |
| Terminal Value |  | 0.463 | $8,126 |
| **Total Present Value of Equity:** |  |  | **$11,058** |

**Price/Book Valuation:** 

Given the latest book value and return on equity (13%) and assuming a growth rate of 3% we obtain a P/B of 1.36 which is in line with the industry average presented in the *Counterpoint Global Insights* report. Since its latest book value was around $7.5 billion we obtain an intrinsic value of $10.2 billion.

**Relative Valuation:** 

The EV to EBITDA is presented in *The Little Book of Valuation* as a metric to use for relative valuation. Since we obtained a price to book of 1.36 we multiply it by 0.75 (the industry average ratio between EBITDA and book value) to arrive at an EV to EBITDA multiple of 1.02. Since EBITDA is around $1.17 billion we obtain an enterprise value of $1.2 billion.

>**Note:** These calculations are based on the financials from 2018-2023 and are sensitive to changes in growth rates, margins, and cost of capital.  Small changes in these inputs can significantly affect the output. 


> Given the DCF valuation of $11.058 billion for equity, add to it the value of other nonoperating assets (which are not included in operating income), such as excess cash and marketable securities, and deduct the value of non-equity claims.  After deducting the book value of outstanding debt and minority interests, we get an intrinsic value per share of $121. Note that this figure was obtained from the company's 2023 annual report.

In conclusion, while Erie demonstrates some characteristics of a company with a narrow moat, its geographic and product line concentrations, as well as the competitive landscape, pose challenges to maintaining and growing its competitive advantages.  A conservative valuation suggests the company might be fairly valued at ~$13.5 billion.
