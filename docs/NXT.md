### Business Overview
{: .highlight }
Nextracker's core business revolves around manufacturing, integrating, and delivering solar tracking and software solutions.

{: .note }
While the company also generates income from software, maintenance, upgrades, and other services, these revenue streams are not yet as significant as sales of tracker systems.

*   **Industry Trends:**
     *  The solar industry is driven by a global push for decarbonization and renewable energy sources.
     *  Demand for solar power is growing rapidly, particularly in utility-scale projects, where Nextracker's products excel.
    *   The industry is also seeing increased adoption of intelligent tracking systems, as they boost energy production by optimizing the position of solar panels throughout the day.
    *   Technological advancements in AI-powered energy solutions are expected to drive greater automation and improvements.

*   **Competitive Landscape:**

  * The solar tracking industry is characterized by significant competition among many players, ranging from larger publicly-traded companies to smaller firms focusing on niche markets.
  *  While Nextracker has established a prominent position in the industry, it faces competition from global manufacturers as well as companies focusing on specific niches.

*   **Competitive Differentiators:**

    *   **Scale and Market Share:** Nextracker has claimed the leadership position as the leading global supplier of solar trackers for several years, indicating a strong market position.
        *  This scale allows the company to enjoy cost advantages that other smaller players cannot replicate.

       * There has been recent changes in trade policy with China, including anti-dumping and countervailing duties against crystalline silicon solar cells and modules. Nextracker states that those will impact its prices.

### Financial Deep Dive

*   **Revenue Growth:** The company has demonstrated robust revenue growth in recent years. As of the first quarter of 2024 they have reported 33% YoY increase in revenues and has reached over $1.5 billion in revenue, showing tremendous growth.
*  **Gross Margins**: Gross margins has been maintained around 20% and it is expected to remain in this region. The company has seen their gross margins dip recently due to shipping constraints and a change in product mix with more high-cost products being shipped.
 * **Operating Expenses**: The company has been steadily increasing its operating expense in R&D, but it sees it as a part of its business strategy that will help it further its competitive advantage and keep its moat durable over time.

*   **Profitability:** Despite revenue growth, profitability is still an issue because of high operating costs. This implies a substantial runway for profitability as the company improves efficiencies.
*   **Cash Flow**: Net cash provided by operating activities has been steadily increasing over the years and as of Q3 2023 the company has a net cash flow of $178.7 million. This is a huge improvement compared to previous periods where net cash was almost zero.
*   **Balance Sheet:** The company has a strong balance sheet, with ample cash and equivalents. The liabilities to asset ratio has been declining over the past 3 years, indicating that the business is becoming less risky with time.
     * Cash position of $538.4 in March 2023
     * Trade receivables of $571.4 million
     * Total debt of $312.5 million
*   **Capital Expenditures:** The company has shown an increase in capital expenditure over the past years as it expands its manufacturing facilities and infrastructure. The cash flow provides enough cover to finance these expenditures and there isn't any considerable effect on its financials.

### Moat Assessment: 2/5

*   **Intangible Assets:** While the company does have intellectual property, their patents can expire or be challenged by competition. Even though they have a strong brand as of now, this brand can be easily eroded. Therefore, tangible assets aren't the primary driver of their moat, even though they play an important part in them.

*   **Switching Costs:** While there are some minor switching costs through software integration, the switching costs of this business are not extremely high. Their customers might not like to change, but it’s a possibility as most of the clients also have different providers and prefer options.

*   **Network Effect:** There are no network effects for Nextracker that can provide a competitive advantage. 

*   **Cost Advantages:** Nextracker's manufacturing scale and location of production gives them some cost advantages compared to smaller players, which is a notable but not extremely strong factor in its moat. The globalized manufacturing base does give them some advantage but it can easily be replicated by other firms. 

{: .important }
*   The company’s vertical integration and cost advantages with specialized manufacturing techniques are helpful to reduce costs further, but are not a primary driver for its profitability.

* **Overall**: Taking all the factors above into account, the moat seems to be on the lower side, with a rating of 2/5. The business can be profitable for many years if it can maintain a slight lead on its competitors and also if industry continues to grow, but a substantial moat isn't fully formed.

### Risk Factors
*  **Competition:** The solar tracking industry is highly competitive and new players can enter the market, which could erode Nextracker's competitive position.
  *   While Nextracker's technology is advanced, new technological advancements could pose a threat if the company does not keep up to it.
*   **Global Supply Chain:** The company relies on a global supply chain for many of its components, which may be exposed to disruption from various factors.
  *  These include factors like trade wars, geopolitical tension or natural disasters. 
*   **Price Volatility of Raw Materials**: Increasing cost of raw material, such as steel, can also increase costs and reduce profitability.
*   **Regulations:** Nextracker may be affected by new or existing regulations related to trade, tax laws, and incentive programs.
 * The government changes regarding tax credits and new subsidies may impact demand and sales. 
  * Especially the US government subsidies are very impactful to its performance.
*   **Economic conditions:** A downturn in global economic conditions could negatively affect the demand and profitability of the company.
*  **Technological Obsolescence**: The rapid pace of technological advancements may make the company’s products less competitive or obsolete.
*    **Debt levels**: A substantial level of debt could have an adverse impact on the company, in a highly volatile market.

### Balance Sheet Health: 4/5

*   **Cash Position:** The company has a strong cash position, with $538.4 million as of March 2023. 
*   **Low Debt:** Total debt is at a manageable level, given the cash on hand and strong cash flows, with debt equity ratio at around 0.3-0.4.
*   **Good Asset base**: Their total current assets are at $1.3 billion and they continue to grow.

### Understandability: 3/5

  *  The company operates in a technology-driven market and understands its position among competitors.
   * However, it does take some time and experience to understand its financials and financial implications in different scenarios.

   * It’s an industrial business which isn't simple to understand. It also has contracts based revenue streams which adds more complexity.
