Pessimistic value: $120 B

IBM operates in a complex and evolving technological landscape. While it has a long and storied history, its ability to adapt and maintain a durable competitive advantage is questionable.  My analysis, guided by a pessimistic and skeptical framework inspired by Benjamin Graham and Michael Burry, suggests a **narrow moat** rating of **2 out of 5**, a management rating of **2 out of 5**, a catalyst rating of **2 out of 5**, and an estimated fair value of **$120 billion**.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


### Moat (2/5)

{: .important }
IBM's moat stems primarily from **switching costs** in its mainframe and middleware businesses and to a much lesser degree from its consulting arm's scale and network effects.   Many of its other businesses, however, are commoditized or face intense competition.  While its historical performance has been decent, the increasing trend towards open-source software and cloud computing, along with the rise of more nimble competitors, poses a significant challenge to its long-term competitive advantage.  IBM’s consulting business, while large, does not exhibit the same level of high switching costs and network effect strength seen in dominant software and financial services firms.  It also faces increasing competition from other consulting firms globally. Further, cost advantages stemming from scale or process are unlikely to be sustainable in a rapidly changing technological landscape. This is because competitors can and will often find ways to become more efficient and gain market share by undercutting the incumbent.

### Management (2/5)

IBM's management receives a mediocre rating due to several factors.  

{: .warning }
* **Capital allocation decisions:** While the acquisition of Red Hat in 2019 can be viewed as a positive move to bolster the company's cloud offerings, other acquisitions have been less successful.   Many of IBM’s other acquisitions appear to have been motivated more by the desire to show top-line revenue growth and keep up with competitors, rather than acquiring truly undervalued companies or enhancing shareholder value (as exemplified in the "Acquisitions" chapter of *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*).  Further, IBM has failed to effectively generate value from internally generated growth - a failure of both vision and execution.

{: .important }
* **Communication:**  Management’s communication, although seemingly transparent, lacks the candor and depth necessary to truly reveal the health of the business.    As mentioned in *The Little Book of Valuation*, story-telling is important, but a good story must be backed up by solid numbers and consistent performance.  IBM's story has frequently been one of promising growth and a shift to more profitable areas, but this story has not been consistently supported by its financials. The company has underperformed the S&P 500 for much of the last decade.

{: .warning }
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation at IBM is high, even relative to peers.   While some may argue that high compensation is necessary to attract and retain talent, from an owner-oriented perspective (as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*), this needs to be balanced against the company's performance and return on invested capital.  There's no evidence that IBM’s high executive pay has translated into exceptional results for shareholders.

* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, which can be viewed negatively, as it suggests that management's interests may not be fully aligned with those of outside shareholders (a point emphasized in both *The Intelligent Investor* and *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*).

### Business and Financials

* **Business Model:**  IBM operates in four major segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing.  Software and Consulting account for the majority of revenues and profits. Infrastructure, primarily consisting of mainframe sales, is a declining business. Financing provides financing for the company's products and services.

* **Revenues Distribution:** The revenue mix is dominated by Software and Consulting, a sign of transition that has taken time to achieve. However, revenue growth overall has been anemic, and several of IBM's businesses (e.g., Infrastructure) are in secular decline.  Further, IBM’s consulting revenues are dependent on general economic growth, making them subject to macroeconomic headwinds.

* **Margins:**  IBM's operating margins have been reasonably stable.  However, margins have declined in some segments, like Infrastructure, which raises questions about the overall profitability and pricing power of the business.  (Information on IBM’s business segments, including margins, can be obtained from its 10-K filings and earnings calls.)

* **Competitive Landscape:**  IBM faces intense competition in almost all of its business segments.  In cloud computing, it lags behind Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.  In consulting, it faces competition from Accenture, Deloitte, and other global consulting firms.  In infrastructure, its mainframe business is under pressure from cheaper and more flexible alternatives. 

* **Financials:**  IBM's financials reveal a company in transition.  Revenues have been flat for much of the last decade, and earnings per share growth has been fueled by stock buybacks.  Free cash flow has been declining.  IBM carries a substantial amount of debt.  (This information is evident from IBM’s financial statements and earnings calls).

### Valuation ($120 Billion)

We will use a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model to estimate IBM's intrinsic value.  A DCF model, as detailed in *The Little Book of Valuation*, is the most robust valuation method, as it focuses on the cash flows that a company will generate in the future.  

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% growth for the next 5 years, then 0% thereafter. (This reflects a pessimistic outlook, given IBM's history of anemic growth and competitive pressures).
* **Operating Margin:**  15% (Assuming a gradual decline from current levels due to competitive pressures).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 20% (Lower than historical averages, reflecting a mature company with fewer high-return investment opportunities).
* **Cost of Capital:**  7% (This is a slightly pessimistic assumption given the low interest rate environment and IBM’s stable business, although its competitive position is weak).
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using a perpetuity with 0% growth.

**Calculations:**

| Year | FCFF (in $ billions) | PV Factor | Present Value (in $ billions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $16.00 | 0.935 | $15.0 |
| 2 | $16.32 | 0.873 | $14.2 |
| 3 | $16.65 | 0.816 | $13.6 |
| 4 | $16.98 | 0.763 | $13.0 |
| 5 | $17.31 | 0.713 | $12.3 |
| Terminal Value | $228 | 0.713 | $162.6 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** |  |  | **$220.7** |

{: .important }


IBM has substantial debt and non-operating assets. To be conservative and recognizing the uncertainties surrounding financial engineering, non-operating assets are subtracted and the market value of debt is added to arrive at equity value.

Debt + Non-operating liabilities = $63.7 billion (source: IBM balance sheet)
Value of non-operating assets = $10 billion (source: IBM balance sheet and earnings call information)

**Value of Equity = Enterprise Value - Non-operating assets + Debt - Cash and cash equivalents**
Value of Equity = $220.7 - $10 + $63.7 = $274.4 Billion

Given the uncertainties around IBM’s future and a tendency toward pessimism, a large margin of safety is applied.

Value of Equity (with a large margin of safety of roughly 50%) =  $137.2 Billion

Therefore, the estimated value per share, given IBM's shares outstanding at roughly 900 million as of June 30, 2024 (source: IBM financial filings), is approximately $152/share. Given IBM's trading price of roughly $130 at the time of the valuation, the stock appears to be trading close to its estimated value, although with the large margin of safety, it appears undervalued.
 
### Catalysts (2/5)

* **Hybrid Cloud Growth:**  IBM is betting heavily on hybrid cloud, and success in this area could drive revenue growth and improve margins.  However, competition is fierce, and IBM faces an uphill battle against established players like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. IBM’s hybrid cloud growth strategy and its early success is mentioned in multiple IBM earnings call transcripts. Example: in the 4th quarter FY 2023 earnings call for IBM Corp.(IBM), John E. Kelly III, Senior Vice President and Executive Officer of IBM, spoke about IBM's success in the hybrid cloud market, specifically focusing on Red Hat OpenShift.

* **AI and Automation:**  IBM is also investing in AI and automation, which could create new revenue streams and improve productivity.  However, these are still nascent technologies, and it's unclear whether IBM has a sustainable competitive advantage in these areas.  During the IBM Corp (IBM) FY 2023 Q1 Earnings Call, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, discussed AI's role within the company's hybrid cloud and software strategy. He mentioned how clients are already using foundation models and creating new use cases, even deploying AI on IBM's platform for their own business operations.

{: .important }


These are both long-term catalysts that face significant competitive and technological hurdles. Therefore, it's prudent to apply a margin of safety to the valuation. Given IBM’s history of unfulfilled potential and struggles with growth, the catalyst rating of 2/5 reflects both a pessimistic view and an acknowledgment of the long road ahead.
