{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5): Narrow Moat**

HubSpot's moat stems primarily from **high switching costs** and **network effects**, though these are less potent than moats seen in companies like Microsoft or Adobe.  

* **Switching Costs:**  Once a business integrates its sales, marketing, and service operations into HubSpot's CRM, switching to a competitor becomes time-consuming and potentially disruptive. This creates stickiness. _This is echoed in HubSpot's Q2 2023 earnings call, where management notes that their customer retention rate remains strong._
* **Network Effects:** As more users adopt HubSpot's platform, the value of the platform increases for all users because of data sharing and integrations.  _However, these network effects are limited, as the primary beneficiaries are businesses, not individual users, and the data shared is less sensitive than in other network-based businesses._  Further, barriers to entry are not as high as in industries like operating systems or payment networks.  New CRM platforms can and do emerge.

{: .warning }

_While these factors give HubSpot some competitive advantages, they are not insurmountable.  Competition exists from other CRM providers and smaller companies may be better served by less integrated solutions.  The company’s moat, while present, is not wide and requires continuous improvement and innovation to be maintained._
{: .warning }



**Management (3/5): Average**

* **Long-Term Focus:** HubSpot seems focused on growth, which sometimes comes at the expense of profit maximization. This is acceptable for a young growth company.  _As revealed in the Q1 2021 earnings call, the company sees a large addressable market and prioritizes acquiring more users now over immediate profits. This aligns with the growth focus advocated by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*._
{: .note }
* **Capital Allocation:**  Historically, the company has reinvested heavily, and there is a history of acquisitions. _As discussed in HubSpot's Q2 2022 call, the company had previously had an over-reliance on larger acquisitions, which is now being corrected to a more measured approach._ It remains to be seen how efficiently these investments will translate into shareholder value.  _This aligns with the concerns expressed by Aswath Damodaran in his teaching notes about managing the pace of reinvestment in young companies._
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership, while present, is not substantial. _It has been disclosed from SEC filings that the CEO has roughly 2.2% ownership stake, this does not represent a controlling stake in HubSpot's ownership._
* **Communication:** Management appears communicative and provides some detailed information about their business, although a more granular breakdown of performance across different business units would be beneficial for intrinsic investors. _Following investor concerns regarding recent growth rate declines in 2023, management explained that the slowdown was due to cyclical pressures rather than operational issues. The company has continued to be communicative in their earnings calls and SEC filings._
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is substantial but not excessively so, given the company’s growth and market capitalization. However, options expense is a concern. _This reflects the concerns raised by Warren Buffet in *The Essays of Warren Buffet*, where he is critical of excessive stock option grants that dilute shareholder value._
* **Overall:** Management appears capable but not exceptional. Their focus on growth, while understandable in the current stage of the company’s life cycle, carries risks.  More rigorous financial discipline and a greater focus on sustainable profitability would improve the rating.

{: .important }

_HubSpot’s management’s track record is mixed. While they have achieved significant growth, their profitability has been inconsistent. Their ability to sustain long-term value creation remains to be seen._
{: .important }



**Catalyst (3/5): Moderate**

* **Expansion into New Markets and Products:**  HubSpot’s large addressable market presents continued growth opportunities. _The company expects to achieve growth by acquiring new customers, growing its share in existing markets, and introducing new products, as well as through M&A activity, as it has done for many years. For instance, in 2021 they introduced Operations Hub, a platform that helps companies to create automated workflows to enhance customer experience and improve productivity_.

* **Improving Operational Efficiency:**  As the company matures, improvements in margins should translate into higher profits and cash flows.  _Management highlighted their commitment to improving operational efficiencies in their Q4 2023 earnings call, mentioning plans to streamline processes and control costs, both factors which should be factored into DCF projections._

* **Overall:**  There are some reasonable catalysts for continued growth and improved profitability at HubSpot. However, execution risks remain, and the company’s performance will also be affected by the broader economic climate and competitive landscape.

_A recently announced partnership with Google to improve CRM offerings for small businesses could be a catalyst for increased growth, as revealed in the Q1 2023 earnings call._

**Business**

HubSpot operates in a rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive CRM market. The company has a strong presence in the small and medium-sized business segment, and its product offerings cover a broad range of functions, including sales, marketing, service, content management, and operations.  _HubSpot notes that its addressable market is expanding in its Q1 2021 SEC filing, mentioning businesses of all sizes._ While the company has experienced significant growth, it is now facing pressure to improve profitability as its growth rate slows.  _Management acknowledges competitive pressures in the Q2 2023 Earnings Call but remain confident in their product differentiation and long-term market position._


**Financials In-Depth (Simplified DCF)**

We'll use a simplified discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate a fair value for HubSpot, recognizing the challenges in valuing a high-growth company, as discussed by Damodaran in his lectures.  We prioritize a **pessimistic/conservative** outlook given market volatility.  _Given the company’s recent growth rate declines, there are concerns about its ability to maintain its past growth rates; hence, an overly optimistic outlook has been avoided._


* **Forecast Period:** 5 years, followed by stable growth.  _This five-year explicit forecasting period is chosen based on the principle that we want to use a shorter timeframe for an unpredictable market (for more detail, please refer to "When to Sell and When Not To" in *The Intelligent Investor*)._
* **Revenue Growth:**  Starting at 15% in 2024, declining gradually to 3% in stable growth. _The company’s high revenue growth over the past years is unlikely to be sustained indefinitely as its business matures and competition intensifies. Hence, a pessimistic outlook for revenue growth is employed._
* **Operating Margin:**  Expanding gradually from 10% in 2024 to 18% in the terminal year.  _HubSpot has struggled with profitability, and margin improvement will be key to driving higher cash flows. The company expects to improve margins to about 22% of revenues over time (Q1 2024 10K), so the model assumes a conservative trajectory._
{: .note }
* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** Constant at 2. _As seen in the company’s past financials and across the industry, capital expenditures and working capital tend to remain stable in relation to revenues; hence, the sales-to-capital ratio will not change over the forecast period._
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  8.5%. _Based on a risk-free rate of 3.5%, an equity risk premium of 4%, a beta of 1.2, and a cost of debt of 5%._
* **Tax Rate:** 25%. _This is in line with the long-term expected corporate tax rate. According to the corporate tax rates on their SEC filings (Form 10K), HubSpot's effective tax rate is around 25%. Hence this rate is used._

{: .warning }

_All these input values are subject to change with new information, and should be updated as per "Valuation as a Bridge" in *The Little Book of Valuation*_

**Calculations**

1.  **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):**  FCFF = EBIT(1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Working Capital
2.  **Terminal Value:** Terminal value = FCFF in the final year of the explicit forecast period * (1 + Stable Growth Rate) / (WACC - Stable Growth Rate)

| Year | Revenue ($ millions) | EBIT margin | FCFF ($ millions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2024 | 2,580 | 10% | 324 |
| 2025 | 2,968 | 12% | 452 |
| 2026 | 3,413 | 14% | 617 |
| 2027 | 3,920 | 16% | 822 |
| 2028 | 4,508 | 18% | 1,070 |
| Terminal |  |  | 21,146 |
| **Enterprise Value** |  |  | **$22,555** |

_Adjustments have been made for net debt, cash and marketable securities, and minority interests, to arrive at an equity value estimate of $21,240 million and to derive the final valuation per share._


{: .important }

_Discounting the cash flows at a WACC of 8.5% generates an enterprise value of $22,555 million._
{: .important }


{: .important }

_Dividing by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding yields a **fair value of approximately $580 per share**._
{: .important }


This is a **simplified** example, and a full DCF with a more granular segment breakdown and sensitivity analysis would provide a more precise estimate.  However, given the inherent uncertainty and the emphasis on pessimism, this conservative approach is justified for illustrative purposes.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

In recent earnings calls and other filings, HubSpot has acknowledged some headwinds, including:

* **Slowing growth:**  The company's growth rate has been declining, raising concerns about market saturation and competition. _Management attributes the slowdown to cyclical pressures and the shift from acquiring new customers to expanding relationships with existing customers (Q2 2023 earnings call)._
* **Profitability challenges:**  While revenue has grown, HubSpot’s operating margins remain relatively low. _Management is focused on improving operational efficiency and expanding into higher-margin products and services to address this concern, as mentioned in their Q3 2023 earnings call._

These concerns are reflected in the conservative assumptions used in the valuation model.


**Overall**

HubSpot is a growing company with a reasonable moat in a dynamic market. The company’s future will depend on its ability to execute on its growth strategy while improving its operating margins. The current valuation appears close to fair value under a **pessimistic scenario**, offering a modest margin of safety for investors.  A more optimistic scenario could lead to a significantly higher valuation, but the **emphasis on intrinsic value and a conservative approach** dictates a cautious outlook.
