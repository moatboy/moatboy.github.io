### Business Overview

HubSpot, Inc. operates a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform designed to help businesses grow and scale.

The HubSpot platform is designed to be used by businesses of all sizes, but it is particularly popular with small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).

The primary way HubSpot generates revenue is through subscription fees paid by its customers. They are categorized as:
* **Subscriptions:** These recurring revenues are for access to the core HubSpot platform and bundled product offerings. Subscriptions make up the vast majority of revenues.
* **Professional services and other revenue:** These include revenue from onboarding, consulting, implementation, and integration services. This revenue is much smaller than subscription revenue.
*  They also have some **other revenue** which is generated from marketplace transactions on the CRM platform.
* The company is currently undertaking efforts to expand their presence in the European Market.

HubSpot's business is heavily reliant on subscription revenue, which is recurring and predictable. The company's focus on inbound marketing methodology sets itself apart from rivals.

Balance Sheet Health: 4/5
{: .highlight }
HubSpot's balance sheet is in a healthy position, with solid cash reserves and no long-term debt. However, their balance sheet has a large amount of intangibles, which might be affected by write-downs.

Understandability: 2/5
HubSpot's business model itself is fairly easy to grasp. They sell a software for managing marketing, sales, and customer service. However, analyzing their financials and interpreting what affects their earnings is quite complex. They use unusual reporting measures like NOPLAT, and their business model is reliant on recurring revenue streams. Evaluating the effectiveness of these measures requires experience and knowledge in analyzing the SaaS industry, which is not a field that is easy to grasp for common investors.
