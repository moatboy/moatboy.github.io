{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

* **Direct Lending:** Blue Owl benefits from some scale in this business and has built a large and diverse loan book. However, it faces increasing competition as more firms enter the direct lending market.  The barrier to entry in direct lending is primarily relationships, and while OWL has significant relationships, it has faced margin compression.
{: .warning }

> From the Q3 2023 earnings call, "I know we've been discussing sort of some margin erosion on the front end in the Direct Lending business. And that's going to continue at least in the near-term."
{: .warning }


* **GP Capital Solutions:** This business enjoys economies of scale and benefits from the illiquidity of the underlying investments, creating a degree of lock-in for its clients.  This is its strongest business segment. 

* **Real Estate:** Blue Owl's real estate operations are relatively standard, mostly focused on U.S. real estate, and lack strong differentiation.  While it participates in the illiquid part of the market, the business lacks a significant competitive advantage.

**Management (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:** The management team has a reasonable track record in the alternative asset management space, but the company's history as a public entity is limited. We need more time to assess the consistency of its capital allocation and growth strategy.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is heavily tied to the company's performance, which can be a double-edged sword. While it can incentivize growth, it can also lead to excessive risk-taking. The lack of detail in the company's reporting regarding the components of executive compensation makes it difficult to properly assess its alignment with shareholder interests.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is high, indicating management's commitment to the company. However, their recent equity offering signals a shift toward reducing insider ownership.
* **Communication:** Management communication is mixed. While recent calls highlight some long-term strategic thinking, there's a lack of granular disclosure about costs and profitability of individual business segments, which makes assessing true economic returns challenging.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

A potential catalyst for Blue Owl could be a successful expansion into newer alternative asset classes, or growth in existing niches like infrastructure lending.  However, these are subject to market dynamics and competitive pressures, and we remain cautiously optimistic about significant near-term share price appreciation solely from these catalysts.

**Valuation ($12.8 Billion):**

We used the key value driver formula (using a conservative and pessimistic outlook) to estimate the intrinsic value, using financial statements from 2019-2023.
{: .note }

> The key value driver formula is Value = NOPLAT / (WACC - g), which is a simplified version of DCF

**Assumptions:**

* **Growth (g):** We assumed a long-term growth rate of 3 percent annually. Global GDP is expected to grow at around 3 percent annually, and as the company matures, we expect its growth to converge on this rate, making this a conservative estimate.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** We assumed a long-term ROIC of 15 percent for Direct Lending and GP Capital Solutions. We assumed 10% for Real Estate, as it requires minimal incremental investment to simply manage the existing properties. 
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**
    * **Cost of Equity:** We estimated the cost of equity using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
         * Risk-Free Rate: 4.5% (10-year U.S. Treasury Bond Rate as of July 2024)
         * Market Risk Premium:  4% (Geometric average of Market Risk Premium 1928–2023)
         * Beta: 1.00 (Median of U.S. Asset Management Companies) 
         * Cost of Equity = 4.5% + (1.00 × 4%) = 8.5%
    * **Cost of Debt:** 6.5%
    * **Target Capital Structure:** 40% Debt, 60% Equity 
    * WACC = (0.40 x 6.5% x (1-.30)) + (0.60 x 8.5%) = 6.9% (30% is a conservative estimate of the company’s marginal tax rate. We assume a reinvestment rate of ROIC/2 or 7.5% for a sustainable growth rate) 

**Calculations:**


We obtained adjusted NOPLAT (after-tax operating income) for 2023 as $637 million.

Value of operations = 637 / (.069 – 0.03) = $15.93 billion

Net Debt = $2.08 Billion

Nonoperating assets = $1.02 billion (Cash and Minority Interests)

Value of Equity = Value of Operations + Nonoperating Assets - Debt

Value of Equity = $15.93 Billion + $1.02 Billion - $2.08 Billion = $14.87 Billion

**Final Valuation**


$14.87 Billion



**Business Overview:**

* **Direct Lending:**  Blue Owl has built a name for itself in this space, growing Assets Under Management (AUM). However, margin pressures are a key concern as competition intensifies. The business of direct lending is primarily about making loans at above-market rates.
* **GP Capital Solutions:** This business line offers continuation funds to existing clients of general partners who own stakes in private equity. This is a much more differentiated and higher ROIC business than Direct Lending, and there's an argument to be made that it is underappreciated. This business requires huge amounts of capital, however, and therefore can only be conducted by large, well-run institutional investors, like BlackRock.
* **Real Estate:** Focuses on U.S. real estate, lacks distinct competitive advantages, and its profitability is dependent on the health of the overall real estate sector.

**Financials (In-Depth):**

While OWL's revenues have been growing, profitability has been less consistent.  A key challenge is translating reported accounting earnings into true economic earnings. The company's current reporting lacks segment breakdowns, making it difficult to isolate the drivers of each business segment's performance. This also makes it difficult to use multiples for comparison with other firms, as these numbers may be distorted at the aggregate level.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Margin Compression in Direct Lending:** Increased competition is squeezing interest margins in the Direct Lending business. This is a major concern going forward, as it can reduce profitability and growth potential. Management has stated that this will likely continue in the near term.
* **Need for acquisitions to sustain growth:** Blue Owl needs to use acquisitions as a driver of growth, and there is always a big risk for big losses on acquisitions, particularly when the economy as a whole is heading toward lower profits.
* **Reliance on the broader economy:**  The success of Blue Owl is still largely tied to the health of the broader economy and private equity markets.
* **Expense increases:** From the Q3 2023 Earnings Call: "...we've added a number of new initiatives...and all that incremental expense is showing up now." Increasing operating expenses could hurt profitability.


**Concluding Thoughts:**

Blue Owl Capital has some elements of a moat, particularly in its GP Capital Solutions business, but faces significant challenges in the increasingly competitive direct lending market. Its lack of financial transparency makes it more difficult to assess its true value. While insider ownership is encouraging, the high reliance on acquisitions and overall financial market conditions makes it a moderate-risk investment. More information and improved performance are needed before awarding the company a wider moat rating.
