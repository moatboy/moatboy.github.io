### Financials

Since WeRide is a private company, detailed financial statements aren't publicly accessible. However, they have raised substantial funding over the years, which indicate the level of capital expenditure going into the business.

{: .important }While the company does not disclose specifics, it is clear that they will be operating in a heavy investment stage. Their revenues might not yet be at a level where they produce significant positive earnings. There may also be a huge degree of risk of failure, as a lot of the new technological developments are usually not successful.
*   **Recent performance**: In the last public information that we could find, for the financial year ending December 31, 2021, the company reported net loss from operations of RMB1,069.4 million, compared to RMB459.3 million from prior year, and loss for the year was RMB1,009.7 million. There was a large growth in the revenue but expenses related to research and development also increased. Total assets were RMB5,014.2 million and total liabilities were RMB4,488.1 million.

    *   This data shows that the company has negative earnings and continues to operate in a heavy investment stage.
  *   **Profitability**: As a technology company focusing on development and R&D, profitability is not a priority.
    *   The company is in its high-growth stage, where profitability may be low as it prioritizes expansion.
  *   **Debt and leverage**: Company's liabilities are much higher than its equity and hence the firm has high leverage, and if it becomes unable to service its debt, then the company has very little safety net.
     * As per Exhibit F-9, the debt is mostly concentrated towards the subsidiary VTP.
   *    **Cash Flow**: The company's cash balance was RMB 1,336.7 million as of Dec 31, 2021. Given the expenses of operation, the current cash flow profile is negative, with the company being dependent on outside funding.

### Moat Analysis: 2/5

Based on the information available, WeRide possesses a limited, and as such, a "narrow" moat. Here is a more comprehensive breakdown:

*   **Barriers to Entry:**
  *   **High Technological Barriers**: The autonomous driving space requires massive R&D, including cutting-edge AI, sensors, software, and hardware. These are not easy to replicate, giving large, well-funded companies a big initial advantage.
  *  **Regulatory Approvals**: Navigating the maze of regulatory approvals (especially for deployment of autonomous systems in real-world environments) is tough, due to constant changes and heavy scrutiny, this also acts as a barrier to new entrants.
  *   **High Capital Requirements:** Developing autonomous driving technologies and deploying them at scale requires massive investments. For this, companies require large sums of money for R&D, talent, engineering, and hardware and software costs, limiting entry to well-capitalized companies.

*   **Intangible Assets (Limited): 1/5**:
 *    **Patents:** While the company is actively seeking patents for their developed technologies, it's hard to evaluate these assets due to a lack of comprehensive details. Furthermore, the patent landscape is fast-changing and highly competitive which makes this moat limited.
 *   **Brand:** Although WeRide is gaining recognition, its brand is not yet a major asset to its market position, unlike more well-known names in the business like Waymo or Tesla. The company does not have much brand recognition compared to some of the larger competitors in the sector.
 *   **Regulatory approvals**: The company, given it's focus in China, has a good amount of regulatory approvals in China, and this creates some barrier to entry for new foreign entrants in China.

*   **Switching Costs (Limited): 2/5**:
  *   For customers who rely heavily on their software and technology, they are locked in with WeRide's offerings.
  *   Given that the company is focused on providing an entire technological suite, including hardware and software, switching vendors will likely be an expensive prospect for the client companies.
  *   However, there are many alternatives in the market and switching to these, while costly, may not be prohibitively expensive.
*   **Network Effect (Limited): 2/5**
    *   The network effects, while potentially present, are limited given that its service is primarily B2B. Data gained from more deployments of its technology can improve the underlying AI algorithms, making it more attractive, but this is hard to quantify. Therefore, the network effects, while present, are difficult to judge. The company also has different types of data sets, including data related to robotaxis and AV trucking which can result in a more diverse training of their AI.
*   **Cost Advantages (Limited): 3/5**:
    *   The company is focusing on achieving cost efficiencies through development of in-house technologies, but it's unclear how much of a competitive advantage they are able to gain against competing firms that are also spending heavily on R&D to lower costs. Furthermore, some companies like Tesla have gained a huge scale advantage, and have lower marginal costs per car.
 *     The company is taking advantage of a low-cost manufacturing ecosystem in China.
*   **Size Advantage (Limited): 2/5**:
  *   Scale can result in more attractive economics for distribution, but WeRide's distribution structure is still not yet big. This is mainly because the company is not yet very well known and its technology still is in its initial stages of deployment.
 * As a new entrant to the industry, WeRide does not have much of a manufacturing scale advantage compared to other competitors.

**Legitimate Risks That Could Harm the Moat and Business Resilience**

* **Technological Obsolescence**: rapid advancements in AI and sensor technologies can quickly render their technology obsolete, creating more competition and limiting their ability to compete.
    * Given the rapidly evolving nature of the technology, a firm must constantly upgrade its offerings to remain competitive. A slowdown in this process can quickly hurt the company's business.
*   **Intense Competition**: The industry is highly competitive and a new player that develops the next technological breakthrough can drastically lower WeRide's prospects.
    *   There are several well-funded players in this market, which makes it extremely important for WeRide to constantly focus on R&D and maintain a high rate of progress.
*  **Regulatory and political headwinds**: Regulatory approvals required to deploy AV technology are not consistent globally. In addition, changes to foreign policy, especially between China and other developed countries may affect its operations and future deployment in other countries.
  * Government incentives and regulations may play a huge role in developing and deploying AV technology. Political changes in various countries might hurt the prospects of the company.
*  **Capital expenditure**: Developing autonomous vehicle technology is incredibly costly and capital-intensive. It requires major investments in R&D, hardware, and software development. The company might experience significant disruptions and problems if funding suddenly becomes scarce or is expensive.
*  **Lack of deployment**: The company is trying to secure more commercial operations, but due to the high risks involved in this area, there is no certainty that the company can obtain large-scale deployment, as even after passing safety regulations, many businesses might prefer to stay with their traditional methods of operations. This would severely affect the growth prospects of the company.

**Business Resilience**

*   **Innovation**: The company is focused on R&D, which can help them come up with new products. Furthermore, companies in autonomous driving face a constant need to innovate to stay relevant, as even the best AI today might not be the best AI tomorrow.
*   **Geographic Concentration**: Their strong focus on China allows them a first-mover advantage in what is potentially the largest market for AVs globally, helping them generate large revenues.
 *    **Diverse applications**: The company's focus on different applications and markets (including robotaxis, trucking, urban logistics etc.) enables them to have different avenues of revenues and to have a safety net if problems arise in any particular business segment.

### Understandability: 4 / 5

The overall business model is fairly easy to understand, with a very specific product in a high-growth industry. While the underlying technology might be tough to grasp fully, the products and services themselves are not hard to comprehend. I have rated this a 4 because of this reason, the technological aspects are complex, and it is hard to evaluate the future performance without an in-depth technical knowledge of the underlying systems. The company is also private and does not provide much data publicly.

### Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5

As it currently stands, the company is in a development stage and is relying mostly on new funding. Therefore, we can not see a large pile of cash on the balance sheet. However, given that the liabilities are more than 3 times that of the equity, and a persistent pattern of negative cash flow, it is likely that the company needs to raise additional funds in the near future. It faces a real risk of bankruptcy if external funding suddenly becomes expensive or unavailable. I have rated this as a 3 due to this high reliance on future cash infusions, and low ability to handle economic disruptions and high debt.
