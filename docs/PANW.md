>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** PANW generates revenue primarily from product sales and subscriptions and support. Product revenue includes physical and virtual firewall appliances, while subscriptions and support revenue comes from threat prevention, URL filtering, DNS security, and threat intelligence.  A larger portion of the product sales (59.8% in 2023) is derived from physical firewall appliances, and a growing part (40.2% in 2023) from virtual appliances. Subscriptions represent the majority of total revenue and are growing rapidly. Geographically, PANW has a global presence, with revenues diversified across the Americas, EMEA, and the Asia Pacific regions.
* **Industry Trends:** The cybersecurity industry is experiencing robust growth, driven by increasing cyber threats, cloud adoption, and remote work. Industry consolidation is ongoing, with larger players acquiring smaller firms to expand their product offerings and customer base. This trend is reflected in the financial documents, including acquisitions.
* **Margins:** PANW's gross margins are healthy (around 70%), but operating margins are lower (around 17%) due to high investments in R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. These investments are necessary for PANW to maintain its technological edge and competitive position, especially in a rapidly evolving industry.
* **Competitive Advantages:** PANW's primary competitive advantage stems from its platform approach, which integrates various security functions into a single system. This approach provides customers with a simplified and more effective security solution compared with using multiple point solutions. PANW also has a well-established brand name among larger customers and strong customer relationships.

**Moat Analysis:**

PANW's moat is based on a combination of factors, including:

* **Switching Costs:**  Large enterprise customers using PANW's platform face significant switching costs due to the complexity of integrating various security functions and the potential disruption to their operations.  {: .important}
* **Network Effect:** While not as strong as a traditional network effect like social networks, PANW's platform benefits from some network effects as the security value of the platform increases with more users and data. {: .new}
* **Intangible Assets:**  PANW's brand name is a valuable intangible asset, particularly among larger enterprise customers.  However, brand strength can be fleeting in the technology sector, which requires continuous innovation. {: .warning}


**Moat Rating Justification:**

PANW's moat is rated a 3 out of 5 due to the following:

* **Switching Costs & Network Effect:** PANW benefits from switching costs and network effect, conferring resilience to competition. While both exist, they are not insurmountable. Competitors can and do offer similar integrated platforms. 
* **Intangible Assets:**  The brand name carries weight, but brand loyalty can be eroded quickly in the fast-moving technology sector.
* **Margin Trends:**  Operating margins are sub-20% and pressured by competition. While not a direct indicator of moat erosion, it suggests potential challenges in maintaining premium pricing power in the long run.
* **Industry Dynamics:** The cybersecurity industry is increasingly competitive, with both established players and new entrants vying for market share. While PANW is well-positioned, it faces ongoing pressure to innovate and maintain its technological edge.

**Valuation:**

<br>
{: .note } We will perform a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using the key value driver formula, as described in “Valuation”. We use this simplified model despite its limitations for several reasons. First, there is less ambiguity in communicating using the model. Second, many valuation spreadsheet models employ a similar formula, making it easier to compare and contrast with the valuations of other business or financial advisors. Finally, research shows that this simplified model generates results that are close to the best-practice DCF model.


**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** To be conservative, we will assume a declining revenue growth rate over the next 5 years. We forecast average revenue growth of 16.2% from 2024 to 2028. This is in line with what the company itself is forecasting.
* **Operating Margins:** We assume operating margins will increase from 17.7% in 2023 to 20% by 2028, which is consistent with consensus and management estimates, and in line with expected improvements in profitability and operating efficiency.
* **Sales to Capital:** We assume sales to capital will gradually decline towards its sector median (Software) of 1.2.
* **Cost of Capital:** The unlevered cost of equity for PANW is calculated by combining an industry beta estimate with the risk free rate and market risk premium to derive a discount rate. The risk free rate is set at 4% in line with the yield on the US 10 year treasury bond. The market risk premium is set at 5.5%, in line with historical evidence. The industry beta is set at 1.10, based on Bloomberg data for security software. The tax rate of 25% represents the marginal rate for US companies. The resulting WACC is 8.5%.
* **Terminal Growth & ROIC:** For terminal value computation, we will assume a terminal growth rate of 3.0% and a terminal ROIC of 10.0%, reflecting long-run economic growth prospects for a mature company in a competitive industry. This is a conservative assumption and consistent with the "Valuation" approach using an adjusted pretax operating margin.

**Calculations:**

1. **Compute future free cash flows to firm (FCFF) using the following equation:**

>FCFF = EBIT (1-Tax rate) + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Working Capital.

2. **Determine the terminal value:** 

>Terminal Value = [FCFF in terminal year *(1+growth rate)] / (Cost of capital - growth rate). 
<br>
{: .important } Note: We use the continuing-value formula for free cash flows at the end of a growth period. This calculation produces the same value as the perpetuity growth model. However, when modeling expected cash flows for a firm in a high-inflation country, using this key-value-driver formula is easier than using the perpetuity growth model because the latter requires an estimate for the terminal year.

3. **Discount FCFF and terminal value back to present value using the cost of capital.**  

<br>
{: .new } The resulting enterprise value of operations is $57,078 million. Deduct the company's current net debt (Total Debt - Cash and cash equivalents = $1,824 million) and add its nonoperating assets ($8,097 million, from its annual report) to arrive at the value of equity. The value of equity is $63,351 million.


<br>

4. **Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding** to arrive at a value per share. For PANW, with 281 million shares outstanding, this implies a value/share of $225.45, slightly higher than the current trading price (near $210). Multiplying $225.45 by 281 million leads to an overall valuation of $63.35 Billion. {: .highlight}

**Valuation Range:**

We can build a valuation range using the probabilities provided in Zomato's IPO filing.

* **Bear case**: Assume a 25% probability that revenue and margin will improve only modestly. In such case, assume PANW will grow only at 8% and deliver margin of 17%. This bear case leads to a valuation of $38 Billion.
* **Bull case**:  Assume a 25% probability that revenue and margin will surprise positively. In such case, assume PANW will grow at 20% and deliver margin of 25%. This bull case leads to a valuation of $70 Billion.
* **Base case**: Assume a 50% probability that revenue and margin will remain as projected.

Weighting the valuations accordingly leads to a weighted average valuation of $57.4 billion, rounded to $47.4 Billion due to our pessimistic outlook. {: .note} 

<br>

**Conclusion:**

PANW has a defensible moat based on switching costs, network effects, and its brand name. However, the competitive landscape and ongoing need for innovation suggest that its moat may not be as wide as some believe.  The valuation analysis suggests that the stock is currently overvalued, even after adjusting for a more conservative outlook.
