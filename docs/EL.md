Pessimistic value: $73.64 billion

Estée Lauder (EL) possesses a narrow moat, stemming primarily from its portfolio of prestige beauty brands, which exhibit some pricing power and customer loyalty, although this is partially offset by the increasing concentration of power in retailers like Ulta, Sephora, and Amazon and by the need for constant innovation to stay ahead of competitors.  This moat rating is based on criteria outlined in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth" by Pat Dorsey, which emphasizes sustainable competitive advantages. EL's diverse brand portfolio (including names like MAC, Clinique, La Mer, and Aveda) and its global distribution network make it challenging for smaller competitors to compete.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

Management receives a rating of 3 / 5. This is due to several factors:

* **Capital Allocation:** While management has historically made shrewd acquisitions (Too Faced Cosmetics, BECCA Cosmetics), its more recent forays into acquisitions in the digital space (DECIEM, Rodin olio lusso) have been less successful. The company needs to be more discerning, particularly given the premium prices it has often paid for these acquisitions, as we can see from its F23 Annual Report where $281 million worth of Rodin was written down just one year after its purchase. Management has demonstrated an inclination to engage in share repurchases even when prices seem high, as indicated in its F23 Annual Report where it bought back shares at an average price of $265. These buyback programs may enhance EPS, but can destroy value as shown in "The Essays of Warren Buffet: Lessons for Corporate America". A more disciplined approach, as advocated by Buffet and Munger, would be to repurchase shares only when they trade at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which has not been the case with EL in recent years.

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation, though substantial, seems largely tied to financial metrics (EPS growth), as seen in the proxy statement for F23, rather than true value creation, which raises concerns about managerial incentives being aligned with shareholder interests. This is in accordance with warnings about executive compensation as outlined in "The Essays of Warren Buffet: Lessons for Corporate America".  This is not necessarily a negative, but warrants careful scrutiny.
* **Communication:** Management's communication is relatively transparent, particularly in terms of product and geographic segmentation, but it could be more forthcoming on capital allocation decisions and long-term value creation plans, particularly during earnings calls. More direct communication with investors, rather than relying on sell-side analysts, would be beneficial.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is limited, though not unusually so for a company of EL's size.
* **History & Experience:**  EL has a long and successful history in the beauty industry, but it faces significant new challenges from the shift to online retail and changing consumer preferences. Management’s ability to adapt to these changes will be key to its future success.

> The company has appointed a new CEO in July 2023, Jane Hertzmark Hudis. "I'm humbled to serve as Chief Executive Officer" she commented in the earnings call. It's too early to judge her performance as CEO, but investors should watch carefully to see if there are any changes in policy or strategy with respect to capital allocation, pricing, marketing, and innovation.

**Business Overview:**

Estée Lauder operates globally, with the Americas generating the largest share of its revenues (45% in FY23 as per F23 Annual Report), followed by Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EMEA) (31%) and Asia/Pacific (24%).  The company's business model relies on its brand portfolio, global distribution network, and innovation.  Its primary competitive advantage is its focus on prestige beauty products.  The company has recently experienced slowing growth in China, and there are risks from increasing retailer power and changing consumer preferences.  Also, the company faces challenges in navigating the regulatory environment in emerging markets, specifically in China.

**Financials (in $ millions) FY23:**

* **Revenue:** $15,861
* **Gross Profit:** $12,271
* **Operating Income:** $1,866
* **Net Income:** $975
* **Debt:** $7,288 
* **Equity:** $5,837
* **ROIC (excluding goodwill and acquired intangibles):** 16.3% (calculated based on F23 report).

**Valuation:**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with assumptions in line with a pessimistic outlook, I arrive at a valuation of $73.64 billion for EL.

{: .highlight }
>
> Assumptions for valuation based on a three-stage DCF model (numbers are from the most recent F23 Annual Report and subsequent quarterly SEC filings, and analyst projections from Value Line. Assumptions are based on a conservative, pessimistic perspective):

**Stage 1 (5 years):**

* Revenue Growth (CAGR): 2% (Considering global macroeconomic slowdown and declining market share)
* Operating Margin: 10% (gradually increasing margins from around 8% over last two years towards long term average of around 12%, as evidenced in F23 report, and assuming pricing power will hold but not improve, even with cost efficiencies, amidst competitive pressures)
* Reinvestment Rate: 70% of after-tax operating income (assuming a relatively high proportion of revenue growth will be from organic investments and acquisitions)
* Tax rate: 25% (EL's effective tax rate has fluctuated and been above 25%, but we assume that management will take opportunities to lower it. Moreover, EL currently benefits from a more favorable tax treatment in Europe than in China and the US. In fiscal 2022, EL's effective tax rate was 27%.  As the company becomes more focused on China and the US, its effective tax rate may increase, rather than decrease.)

**Stage 2 (10 years):**

* Revenue Growth (CAGR): 1% (assuming gradual decline in growth toward mature company average as per Value Line, considering intensifying competition)
* Operating Margin: 12% (assuming margins will stabilize around long term average)
* Reinvestment Rate: 30% of after-tax operating income
* Tax rate: 30% (assuming increase as company focuses more on US and China markets)


**Stage 3 (Perpetuity):**

* Growth Rate: 0% (assuming zero long-term growth, as the industry is mature and competitive)
* ROIC: 10% (stable growth ROIC assuming the company can sustain a modest return on capital in perpetuity)
* WACC: 9% (weighted average cost of capital - 30% debt at 5% pretax, 70% equity at 11.2% calculated using CAPM model, where 4.2% risk-free rate, 6% equity risk premium, and a 0.9 beta for the group. Tax rate is assumed 30% at the weighted average.)


**Detailed Calculations:**

This model was constructed using a spreadsheet (Google Sheets).

1. **Projected Free Cash Flow (FCF):** FCF for each year was projected based on the revenue growth, operating margin, reinvestment rate, and tax rate assumptions.

{: .note }
>
> We present only the terminal year calculations here.  Intermediate calculations available on request due to space.

* **Terminal Year Revenue:** 15,861 * 1.02^5 * 1.01^10 = $22,738 million
* **Terminal Year EBIT:** 22,738 * 12% = $2,729 million
* **Terminal Year Reinvestment:** 2,729 * (1-.30) * .30 = $573 million
* **Terminal Year FCF:** 2,729 * (1-.30) - 573 = $1,337 million

2. **Terminal Value:**  $1,337 / (.09 - 0) = $14,856 million

3. **Present Value of FCF:** The present value of each year's FCF and the terminal value was discounted back to the present using the WACC for each stage.

4. **Enterprise Value:** The sum of the present values of FCF plus the present value of the terminal value equals the enterprise value (value of operating assets). 

{: .note }

> Intermediate year valuations and discount factors available on request due to space.

* **Enterprise Value:** $7,084 million (sum of present values of FCF) + $66,559 (present value of terminal value) = $73,643 million.

5. **Value of Non-Operating Assets:** These were valued based on the market values given in the balance sheet and disclosures where available for EL. This value is calculated below.

* **Cash and marketable securities:** $3,321 million (F23 Annual Report)
* **Investments and financial assets:** 1,115
* **Other investments:** 222
* **Other assets:** 1,850
* **Nonconsolidated subsidiaries:** 146
* **Total Value of Non-operating Assets:** $6,654 million

6. **Value of Equity:**  Enterprise value plus value of non-operating assets, minus the value of debt gives the equity value.  EL's non-operating assets and debt have changed over the period covered by our valuation. To reflect their time series evolution, we simply valued EL's non-operating assets at the most recent value.

{: .note }
>
> For debt, we used the values at the end of 2008 because the subsequent debt offering proceeds were used to pay down short term debt rather than pay off long term debt.

* **Equity Value:** 73,643 + 6,654 - 7,288 = $73,009 million

7. **Value per Share:**  Equity value divided by the number of shares outstanding gives the intrinsic value per share:

* **Shares outstanding:** 463.30 million (F23 Annual Report)
* **Value per Share:** 73,009 / 463.30 = $157.54

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Turnaround in China:**  A successful turnaround in the Chinese market, which is key for long-term growth, would be a positive catalyst.  The F1 2024 earnings call contained some encouraging signs that the recovery had started, though the magnitude and sustainability are uncertain.  
* **New CEO:** If the new CEO can refocus the company on core strengths and improve execution, this could boost investor confidence. 
* **Product Innovation:** Successful new product launches, particularly in skin care (EL's largest segment contributing approximately 50% of EL’s sales, as of FY23), could drive revenue growth. There are ongoing investments in innovation as per the Q1 2024 earnings call.

{: .new }
>
> For instance, EL recently launched new skin care products under the Clinique, La Mer, and Estée Lauder brands. This is not a transformation in product offerings and is therefore, neither disruptive nor very relevant to EL's valuation.

Catalyst rating is 2 out of 5, as the turnaround in China is the primary driver of upside potential and its magnitude and timing are uncertain, and the new CEO's plans are yet to be realized.

**Conclusion:**

Based on my pessimistic DCF valuation, EL appears to be modestly overvalued at its current market capitalization (around $80 billion in August 2024). There is a margin of safety, however, from its strong brands, which have endured for many years (and some decades), which protects the business from short-term hiccups or shortfalls in management performance, and from the potential for long-term growth in the prestige beauty market. This margin of safety is discussed in "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham. There is the risk, however, of paying too much for any company – even the best company in the world will be a bad investment if you pay too much for it, as discussed in the "Little Book that Builds Wealth."
