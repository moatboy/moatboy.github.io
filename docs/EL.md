* **Independent/Niche Brands:** A plethora of smaller, independent brands that offer unique and niche products which attract a specific type of consumers.

{: .important }

* **Strong Brand Portfolio:** A diverse portfolio of well-known and reputable brands provides a strong competitive advantage, capturing a wide range of consumers.
* **International Reach:** Its extensive global presence allows it to tap into different markets and reduce reliance on a single region, helping to weather economic fluctuations in different countries.

{: .important }
**Moat Assessment (4/5):**
EL possesses a wide moat, which is primarily based on:

*   **Brand Strength:** EL's portfolio of brands has strong recognition and loyalty, giving them pricing power and the ability to maintain market share.
*  **Intangible Assets** The company has developed numerous brands with distinctive identities, allowing it to extract value from consumers, this also includes several patents that protect their innovation in products and processes. 
*  **Economies of Scale:** Their size enables them to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and distribution. They are able to have very strong negotiations with manufacturers and retailers, thus maintaining lower costs than smaller competitors.
*   **Product Differentiation:** A constant focus on creating innovative products along with a focus on customization to attract diverse consumers builds a level of loyalty which is hard to recreate. 

These factors allow EL to maintain premium pricing and retain customers which gives the company an edge over its competition.

**Risks That Could Hurt The Moat**

There are certain risks that could erode or negatively affect the company’s moat:
*   **Brand Erosion:** Changes in consumer preferences, particularly through social media trends and influencers, or a significant event damaging a specific brand's reputation, can reduce the appeal of existing brands. 
*   **Intense Competition:** The beauty industry is highly competitive, and new entrants and innovative products can erode market share if not dealt with well. Competition from indie brands might especially threaten existing market leaders. 
*   **Economic Downturn:** In a recession or times of economic slowdown, consumers may switch to cheaper or more affordable beauty options over their usual luxury options, impacting revenue and brand prestige. 
*   **Increased Cost of Raw Materials/Supply Chain Issues:** Increases in the cost of raw materials or continued supply chain issues (like the impact of ongoing geopolitical issues) might reduce profit margins.
*   **Failure to Maintain Innovation:** The company’s performance relies heavily on constantly innovating. If they fail to innovate and adapt, their product offering will become dated quickly.

**Business Resilience:**
Despite these risks, EL exhibits robust business resilience because:

*   **Diversified Portfolio:** The company’s diversified portfolio of brands and product categories helps it withstand fluctuations in a specific market segment or trend and protects from losses in particular segments of the company.
*   **Global Presence:**  Being present in various economies all over the world reduces its dependency on single regions. 
*   **Established Distribution Channels:** A strong global network of distribution channels, both physical and online, enhances the company’s stability and market reach.
*  **Proven Track Record** They have shown a history of being able to acquire competitors successfully and also maintain their moat and grow over long periods of time with consistency.
*   **Focus on Prestige:** The company's focus on prestige market, which tends to be less price sensitive, offers some degree of protection from economic downturns, and from more value-driven competitors.

**Understandability (3/5):**
The business of EL is relatively easy to understand in terms of how they make revenues. The complexity arises when trying to understand how their products are differentiated. Also, predicting consumer behavior and preferences in the luxury/beauty space is difficult. 

{: .important }
**Balance Sheet Health (4/5):**
EL's balance sheet is relatively healthy though there are some areas of concern.  They have a high amount of debt at almost 10 billion, which is the highest in the past 5-6 years. This amount of debt is significant, but they should have no problem in repaying as they have good liquidity. They are actively pursuing initiatives to restructure the organization and pay down the debt. Although their overall balance sheet is healthy, a sudden dip in revenues could create problems in the coming years.
