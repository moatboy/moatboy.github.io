{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

TPL's moat stems primarily from its unique land holdings in a highly productive oil and gas region. This gives it a small degree of pricing power. This is somewhat analogous to what Pat Dorsey describes as a unique asset in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. However, the moat is narrow. Commodity prices heavily influence TPL's profitability, and it lacks diversification. Further, the ease of entry into land ownership—anyone with sufficient capital can acquire land—limits the company’s moat.

**Management (3/5):**

TPL's management receives a mixed rating due to several factors.

* **Positives:** TPL has a history of conservative capital allocation, prioritizing returning cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks rather than pursuing growth through acquisitions, as Aswath Damodaran advocates in *The Little Book of Valuation*.  This suggests a focus on shareholder value.  Furthermore, management communication is generally candid about the company's challenges and prospects, as evidenced by their discussions of oil price volatility and the difficulty of predicting future water demand in earnings calls.
* **Negatives:** Executive compensation could be considered high relative to peers, even with the transition to restricted stock, and is heavily tied to stock price performance, giving incentives for short-term focus, similar to what Michael Burry describes as rampant options-related distortions in his writings, such as his 2000 article on buying shares of Senior Housing Properties. This could be addressed by tying management incentives to return on invested capital as Damodaran advocates in his 2009 report *The Dark Side of Valuation*, though doing so is not a panacea.  Additionally, insider ownership (though significant in the company's early history) is minimal. Finally, TPL's diversification is very poor, focusing entirely on one business, one sector, and one geographical area, even though some of its free cash flow could be deployed in diversification initiatives, similar to the companies Burry mentions in his 2000 and 2001 market commentaries. This lack of diversification reduces managerial flexibility to respond to changing industry conditions.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

The potential for increased oil and gas production in the Permian Basin is a minor catalyst for TPL.  However, given the cyclical nature of the industry, any increases in production are unlikely to translate into long-term, sustainable value creation, as outlined by Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels in *Valuation*.  Further, the rising competition in the water services business could decrease the profitability of the company’s existing water rights.  Additionally, any regulatory change to tax or royalty rates would adversely affect the company's cash flows. Overall, the possibility of upcoming catalysts is moderate.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** TPL's revenue streams are largely tied to oil and gas production, with a smaller portion from water sales and surface leases.  Water services revenue in particular has grown significantly in recent years, but rising competition (as discussed by management in the Q2 2023 earnings call) in this arena could lead to margin pressure.
* **Industry Trends:** The Permian Basin remains a highly productive oil and gas region. However, the industry is cyclical and impacted by energy prices.
* **Margins:**  Historically, TPL enjoys high operating margins due to its low operating costs.
* **Competitive Landscape:** TPL has a near monopoly in terms of land ownership in its core region, but other companies can (and do) provide services to oil and gas producers operating on TPL's land.  The broader competitive landscape remains dominated by large oil and gas companies.

**Financials:**

TPL's financial statements demonstrate high operating margins, driven by its largely fixed-cost business. However, revenue growth is closely tied to oil and gas production. The company's financials show substantial amounts of excess cash and marketable securities relative to its capital expenditures, giving the company enormous flexibility to generate additional returns for shareholders if it so desires, as discussed by Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway letters included in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.

**Valuation ($10.2 Billion):**


The following DCF valuation was performed in July 2024 using the most recent Texas Pacific Land Corporation (TPL) annual report (10-K filing).

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 5% for the next 5 years, then 3% in perpetuity. This is based on the long-term nominal growth rate of the U.S. economy (3%) and a small premium for additional growth in the Permian basin as discussed by management in their quarterly calls.
* **Target Operating Margin:** 45% in perpetuity. This is based on the historical average operating margin from 2019 through 2022.  As seen in the Q2 2023 earnings call, competition in the water services business is heating up, which could lead to margin compression for the Water segment.  Therefore, 45% is used to reflect the company’s probable margin contraction in the near future. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 20% of after-tax operating income. This is based on the historical reinvestment rate from 2019 through 2022, assuming historical trends will continue.
* **Cost of Equity:** 9% in perpetuity.  This is estimated based upon the company's beta of 0.92 (calculated from a regression of its stock against the S&P 500 during 2019 through 2022), a risk-free rate of 4.0% (the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond in July 2024), and an equity risk premium of 5.5% (the historical average from 1928 to 2023). This reflects the heightened risk in an undiversified company and the cyclicality in the energy sector.
* **Cost of Debt:** 5.5%.  This is based on the company's current bond yield.
* **Target Capital Structure:** 15% Debt, 85% Equity. This is based on its long-term historical average debt ratio. Given its current debt levels are significantly above historical levels, this is a more conservative target capital structure.
* **Tax Rate:** 25%. This is the current corporate tax rate.

**Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | Reinvestment | FCFF | Discount Factor | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $5,225 | 45% | $2,351 | $470 | $1,881 | 0.917 | $1,725 |
| 2 | $5,486 | 45% | $2,469 | $494 | $1,975 | 0.842 | $1,663 |

| 4 | $6,048 | 45% | $2,722 | $544 | $2,178 | 0.708 | $1,541 |
| 5 | $6,350 | 45% | $2,858 | $572 | $2,286 | 0.650 | $1,486 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  | $41,235 | 0.650 | $26,803 |
| **Present Value of Operating Assets:** |  |  |  |  |  |  | $34,818 |
| + Cash and Marketable Securities |  |  |  |  |  |  | $663 |
| - Value of Debt |  |  |  |  |  |  | $425 |
| = Value of Equity |  |  |  |  |  |  | $35,056 |
| Number of Shares Outstanding |  |  |  |  |  |  | 165.3 |
| **Value per Share:** |  |  |  |  |  |  | $212 |

>Note: The current market price of TPL is not provided as context requires specifying which quarterly report this valuation was performed using. However, the calculated intrinsic value per share of $212 represents a discount of around 50% compared with the company’s last trade price at the time of writing of $489 per share.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

In recent earnings calls, TPL management has discussed the increasing competition in the water services business.  This could compress margins and impact future growth in this segment. Additionally, the company faces ongoing litigation related to water rights, which adds to uncertainty.  These issues need to be monitored carefully, given the company's lack of diversification.  

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

>While oil prices remain high, increased oil production in the Permian basin could be a medium-term positive catalyst for TPL. In addition, if TPL is able to resolve its ongoing litigation surrounding its water rights, it would reduce a significant amount of uncertainty and therefore improve its outlook, as legal and regulatory issues can create substantial costs. In the Q1 2024 earnings call, TPL also noted that is focused on adding new customers for its fiber optic network business, which, given high margins associated with providing such services, is quite positive.


This valuation and analysis is based on currently available information and incorporates a degree of pessimism. As with any investment, a margin of safety is crucial, and investors should conduct their own due diligence before making any investment decisions. As Benjamin Graham rightly advises in *The Intelligent Investor*, investing is about managing risk. By refusing to pay too much for an investment, and by always being permanently diversified, you can make sure that your mistakes will never become catastrophes.
