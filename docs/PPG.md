>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

PPG derives a moderate moat from a combination of factors:

* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs for customers in certain segments, like aerospace and automotive coatings, are moderately high.  This is due to the integration and testing required to qualify new coatings.  This creates stickiness in their customer base, aligning with the principles of customer lock-in described in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. For example, PPG noted in its Q2 2023 earnings call that certain products can qualify at the OEM level, meaning that the downstream OEM would use a particular product throughout its network of facilities, thus creating lock-in.
* **Intangible Assets (Brand):**  PPG benefits from brand recognition and reputation in some of its specialized coatings businesses.  However, as discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brand value alone does not constitute a moat unless it leads to pricing power. PPG’s pricing power is limited due to competition in many of its segments. This is further evidenced by the fact that PPG's net income or earnings per share (EPS) can be significantly affected by the company's pricing decisions. For example, in its Q4 2022 earnings call, the management mentioned that the firm's strategy had been to increase prices to offset high costs of raw materials.
* **Scale:** PPG benefits from economies of scale, particularly in its manufacturing and distribution networks.  This enables it to compete on price in some segments, though as pointed out in *Valuation*, scale itself is often misconstrued as a source of competitive advantage. The size advantage can create a formidable competitive edge, but it is the efficiency of scale that matters.

**Moat Concerns:** In many of its end markets, particularly on the retail side, PPG faces significant competition, limiting its pricing power and ultimately the strength of its moat.  The erosion of moats, as discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, can happen rapidly as competitive pressures increase.  This is a key risk to consider.


**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:**  PPG has a history of acquisitions and divestitures. While some acquisitions appear strategically sound, their success in creating value is questionable, reflecting the complexities associated with the merger and acquisition (M&A) process described in *Valuation*. The company's substantial share buyback program, while likely beneficial in the short term, does not appear to be a source of sustainable value creation. There are many examples provided in the *Essays of Warren Buffett* and *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* in which it is shown that if the managers can find worthwhile investments at good prices, they will make money for the shareholders by putting money in projects and services, and vice-versa; Whereas, buybacks are the only way of generating profit only when a company doesn't have other investment opportunities. In the Q3 2022 earnings call, for example, PPG announced that it had repurchased $500 million worth of its shares.  This coincided with a period of declining share prices, suggesting a more long-term orientation. PPG has also done this in the past, like when it repurchased about 20% of its stock now valued at roughly $2 billion (net of repurchases since the first offering to the public in 1948) from its own owners in the open market (Q4 1988).
* **Communication:** PPG’s investor communication is adequate, though sometimes less than candid.  For instance, during several years in the first decade of the 2000s, PPG management’s “pro-forma” net income figures were as much as 30% higher than the net income figures shown on the company’s income statements. In its Q1 2023 earnings call, management attributed PPG's sales success to higher prices rather than volume growth. The company uses adjusted measures of profitability for internal analyses, however, for an assessment of management performance, the most natural perspective is to use measures of pre-tax profitability, like the ROIC before goodwill, because it is available to everybody. This suggests that they prioritize short-term gains over longer-term value creation. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to performance metrics, some of which are short-term focused.  While the details on executive compensation have not been provided here, PPG does link a portion of executive stock awards to individual performance, to further drive incentive alignment between management and shareholders.
* **Insider Ownership:** Information on insider ownership is not available here, making it difficult to assess management’s alignment with shareholder interests.


{: .note }

**Management Concerns:**  PPG's focus on share repurchases and managing short-term earnings can be viewed negatively. While it doesn't suggest dishonesty, it does raise questions about their commitment to long-term value creation.  This lack of long-term vision is a potential weakness.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

PPG’s growth prospects are tied to global economic growth and its ability to innovate in its core businesses.  A potential catalyst is their continued expansion in emerging markets, though the rate at which these emerging markets lag relative to the size of the market must be taken into account. Other catalysts could be acquisitions, such as when PPG bought several companies between 2014 and 2016 (including its 2015 acquisitions of MetoKote Corp., a protective coatings company, and Comex Group, a leading supplier of paints, coatings, and related products).  However, given the company's inconsistent track record with acquisitions, this is not a high-conviction catalyst.

{: .note }

**Catalyst Concerns:**  PPG faces significant challenges, including rising raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, and global macroeconomic uncertainty.  These headwinds could hinder its ability to capitalize on growth opportunities. As CEO Michael McGarry mentioned in the 2022 Q4 earnings call, inflation and supply chain disruptions are still lingering and creating uncertainties. PPG also noted the risk of rising inventory and other asset costs due to inflation. In the same earnings call, the management highlighted the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on its results.  Further complicating this, raw material costs and availability, as well as the cost and availability of energy, are important risk factors for PPG.


**Business:**

PPG operates in a global market, with a significant portion of its revenue coming from North America.  The coatings industry is mature and fragmented, as PPG notes in the call that it has 4,000 competitors globally.  PPG competes on a mix of price, performance, and brand, serving diverse end markets including automotive, aerospace, architectural, and industrial coatings.  Its operating margins are generally healthy but vary significantly across segments. In its Q3 2023 earnings call, PPG also mentioned that the industrial segment is facing higher raw material costs, and the company plans to focus on pricing actions to mitigate this.

{: .important }

**Key Business Risks:** PPG is exposed to various risks, including fluctuations in raw material prices (especially oil, titanium dioxide, and natural gas), supply chain disruptions, foreign currency movements, macroeconomic uncertainty, and changing customer preferences and end-use demand drivers.

**Financials:**

PPG has a mixed financial profile.  Its revenues and earnings have grown moderately over the past decade, though this growth has been inconsistent and largely driven by M&A activity, which would need to be incorporated when developing a financial projection.  The company has a solid balance sheet with reasonable debt levels, given its mature industry.  However, its cash flow from operations has declined significantly since the 2008 financial crisis, a worrying sign in some ways. Free cash flow is a critical metric for determining the quality of a company's earnings. For PPG, this ratio was not particularly impressive, but the company's free cash flows had been negative for two consecutive years before becoming positive.

**Valuation ($30 Billion):**

My valuation of PPG is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.  To account for the uncertainty associated with valuing any company and the numerous risks facing PPG, I have adopted a relatively pessimistic set of assumptions. For example, PPG has recently announced a new product, but we will assume this new product will not lead to any increase in PPG's earnings, given that most such announcements fail to achieve their target results.  PPG has also been facing significant environmental liabilities, including asbestos litigation, and remediation of various sites; Therefore, we will include additional liability of $77 million in the model. This estimate is taken from the company's balance sheet ($33 million at the end of the fiscal year for asbestos exposure plus $44 million in accrued environmental reserves). PPG, as it has in the past, will probably need to continue to deal with these sorts of liabilities as asbestos and other environmental litigation is almost certain to continue well beyond the timeframe being projected, making PPG's earnings less valuable. This may seem unduly harsh, but unless you apply some additional hurdle to account for a firm’s historic propensity for self-inflicted wounds, your valuation is more likely to be optimistic rather than realistic. PPG has also made acquisitions to buy earnings and growth from other companies; However, since they have not delivered the expected results, I will assume that these acquisitions will not create value for PPG shareholders.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% annually for the next 5 years (in line with expected GDP growth in developed economies; In the past few years, PPG’s revenue growth was driven by acquisitions or higher pricing to offset increased raw material costs, and not by increase in actual sales and/or volume; PPG's market position and business model do not give us any reason to believe that it has much of a sustainable competitive advantage)
* **Operating Margin:** 14% (in line with historical average)
* **Sales/Capital Ratio:** 1.4 (in line with historical average)
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  30% (based on revenue growth rate and return on capital)
* **Cost of Capital:** 8% (based on WACC calculation; PPG has a credit rating of A− to BBB+, implying a default spread of 1-2%; PPG's business is not extremely cyclical, so a country-risk premium adjustment is not required)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2% (in line with long-run inflation expectations)

**Calculations:**

* **Free Cash Flow (FCF) to the Firm (2024-2028):**
| Year | Revenue | Operating Income | Taxes (25%) | Net Income | Reinvestment | FCF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2024 | $19,308 | $2,703 | $676 | $2,027 | $608 | $1,419 |
| 2025 | $19,887 | $2,784 | $696 | $2,088 | $626 | $1,462 |
| 2026 | $20,482 | $2,868 | $717 | $2,151 | $645 | $1,506 |
| 2027 | $21,094 | $2,955 | $739 | $2,216 | $665 | $1,551 |
| 2028 | $21,723 | $3,045 | $761 | $2,284 | $685 | $1,599 |

* **Terminal Value (2028):** $41,235 million (using the perpetuity growth method with the above assumptions)
* **Present Value of FCF (2024-2028) and Terminal Value:** $30,014 million (discounted at the cost of capital)

{: .note }

**Valuation Details:** The resulting value of the firm divided by the number of shares outstanding (480 million) yields an estimated value per share of approximately $62.5.

**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Raw Material Costs and Inflation:** Rising raw material costs and inflationary pressures have impacted PPG's profitability.  Management has been focused on pricing actions to offset these pressures, but their ability to fully pass on these costs is uncertain, as discussed in their Q3 2023 earnings call.  This is a significant risk to my valuation, as it relies on relatively stable margins.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The ongoing supply chain disruptions have also impacted PPG’s operations.  The management emphasized, in Q2 2023 earnings call, its ability to resolve these near-term supply chain disruptions, and increase capacity accordingly and this should allow PPG to start benefitting from the improved volume in future quarters.
* **Environmental Liabilities:**  PPG’s environmental liabilities pose an ongoing financial and reputational risk.  The company has been actively managing these liabilities, but the potential for further costs and lawsuits remains.
* **Global Macroeconomic Uncertainty:**  The uncertain global macroeconomic environment, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and recent banking crises in the U.S., has created a challenging climate, and has increased risk in nearly every stock valuation. The ongoing slow economic recovery and high interest rates also continue to negatively impact the company's sales volume as consumers put off purchase decisions, as noted in the 2023 Q2 earnings call. The management addressed this and mentioned that despite macroeconomic challenges, they have the right portfolio of businesses and brands for long term.

**Overall Assessment:**

PPG is a solid, though not spectacular, company in a mature industry.  Its moderate moat provides some protection against competition, but it is not insurmountable.  Management’s focus on short-term metrics and aggressive share buybacks raise questions about their long-term vision.  My valuation suggests the company is fairly valued at the moment, with a fair value of approximately **$30 billion**.
