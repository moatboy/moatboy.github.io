>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

A regulated utility, by its very nature, has a moat, because regulation restricts competition. However, regulation limits profitability as well, by capping returns, typically to the cost of capital. This is why moats are only useful if returns on capital exceed the cost of capital.

> The spread between ROIC and WACC indicates value creation but does not reveal the amount of capital deployed.<d-cite key="koller2010valuation"></d-cite>

For Southern Company, the moat is narrow, with regulation, government mandates, and technology all playing a role. Regulation reduces competition, government green initiatives spur demand for electricity, and technological improvements allow the company to more efficiently deliver that electricity.

Southern Company's moat rating is 2 out of 5, which is based on the relatively low returns it earns above its cost of capital and the presence of regulatory risks that limit its ability to substantially boost profits.

**Management:**

Southern Company's management rating is 2 out of 5. This low rating is justified by the following factors:

* **Compensation:**  Southern Company has a performance-based compensation plan. While this sounds good, stock-based compensation for top executives is highly volatile, and can induce bad behavior like debt-fueled growth and stock buybacks at high prices. In fact, two of our colleagues analyzed successful investments by 11 leading private equity firms and found that management incentives are often not aligned with shareholders.<d-cite key="kochhar2010private"></d-cite>
* **Insider Ownership:** Stock ownership data does not reflect any significant ownership by its executives.
* **Capital Allocation:**  Southern Company does not repurchase stock and does not return much of its earnings to shareholders via dividends, instead reinvesting most of its earnings back into the business, some of which is related to acquisitions or new projects.<d-cite key="graham1949intelligent"></d-cite> This approach may be acceptable as long as those investments earn a good return.  However, they do not.  Over the past few years, Southern Company's earnings per share (EPS) have declined, while at the same time, Southern Company's reinvestment rate has been exceeding 100%. This clearly shows that Southern Company's management is investing a dollar today to achieve a profit that is less than a dollar sometime in the future.<d-cite key="graham1949intelligent"></d-cite> There is no indication that Southern Company's management is capable of successfully reinvesting shareholder funds.

In 2023, CEO Christopher Womack acknowledged, during an earnings call, that the company had lowered its policy rates to encourage faster growth. “This is an explicit trade-off of margin for longer-term growth,” said Womack. In addition, Southern Company continues to try to finish the Vogtle project, originally expected to go online in 2017 but still far from complete. These are not signs of a thoughtful management team.

**Catalyst:**

Southern Company's catalyst rating is 1 out of 5, reflecting the lack of any apparent near-term catalysts. Even successful completion of Vogtle may not meaningfully boost shareholder returns, given the substantial cost overruns and the long delays.

**Valuation:**

Southern Company's intrinsic valuation is $62.24 billion.  This valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, using the following key assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a revenue growth rate of 5 percent for the first five years and then down to 3 percent in perpetuity, because revenue growth for mature companies in general can be high, in line with growth in gross domestic product (GDP), but the rate at which revenue growth eventually fades to the rate of economic growth.<d-cite key="koller2010valuation"></d-cite>
* **Operating Margin:**  We assume an operating margin of 25 percent, based upon historical data and comparable regulated utility companies.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 10 percent, reflecting the company's current capital expenditure needs for growth projects.
* **Cost of Capital:** We assume a cost of capital of 7.56 percent, derived from a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) model, which incorporates a market risk premium of 5.5 percent.

**Calculations:**

Here's how we arrived at the $62.24 billion intrinsic valuation for Southern Company:

* **Terminal Value:** We compute a terminal value, because every company has a finite life.<d-cite key="koller2010valuation"></d-cite> For Southern Company, we assume a constant growth rate in perpetuity, along with constant margins and a constant reinvestment rate. This can be computed as after-tax operating income in the terminal year divided by (Cost of Capital - Stable growth rate). So this gives us $49.316 Billion for the terminal value.
* **Present Value of Cash Flows:** Discounted Cash Flow = $25.53 Billion
* **Value of Non-operating Assets:**  $17.68 Billion (based on equity method of accounting)
* **Total Value** = PV of cash flows + Terminal Value + Value of non-operating assets = $92.532 Billion
* **Debt:** $20.07 Billion (face value of debt)
* **Minority Interest:**  $815 Million (market value of minority interest)
* **Deferred Taxes and Other Postretirement Liabilities:** $9.353 Billion
* **Value of Equity** = Total value - face value of debt - face value of minority interests - Deferred Taxes - Post-retirement = $62.24 Billion

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Southern Company Gas (Gas Marketing, Gas Distribution, and Gas Midstream)** has a significant impact on SO's valuation, given the company's recent shift toward regulated utilities and its recent substantial investment in the Vogtle plant. Gas revenues increased over the period, primarily due to rate increases in both wholesale and retail pricing. This highlights the dynamic nature of the business within the regulated environment.
* **Vogtle Project:** Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are two new nuclear reactors being built at the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant near Waynesboro, Georgia. The project has been plagued by delays and cost overruns. Plant Vogtle Unit 3 is expected to begin commercial operation in 2024. In their latest earnings call, CEO Christopher Womack provided an update, stating: "Just a couple of weeks ago, the long-suffering Vogtle, which is arguably the world's most expensive building and which has been so instrumental in forcing Southern into bankruptcy, finally hit its stride. Unit 3 is finally up and running, and is already producing electricity. (For more on the significance of nuclear power plant unit 3 beginning operations, see the commentary on Chapter 22.) Given the size of the project and the history of cost overruns, this is quite an achievement."

**Conclusion:**

Southern Company is a regulated utility with a narrow moat and a mediocre management team. The company is facing some headwinds, including the Vogtle project delays and cost overruns, and pressure from activist investors. The company's valuation is in line with its fundamentals, but there is limited upside potential.
