>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Business Overview**

* **Revenue Distribution:** SMFG's revenue primarily comes from interest income (Net interest income), fee and commission income, and net trading income. Net interest income, a significant portion of which comes from loans and other interest-bearing assets, represents a majority of its income.  Fee and commission income arises from brokerage, transaction advisory, and asset management services, while net trading income is derived from trading activities in financial instruments. The company's segment data reveals significant diversification across these three revenue sources, with wholesale banking being the largest contributor. 

>  Note: In the current economic environment, the net trading income component can be volatile.

* **Industry Trends:** The Japanese banking industry has seen increasing consolidation over recent decades, although it is still relatively fragmented compared to some other developed economies. There has also been a shift toward digitalization, putting pressure on traditional banking models.  SMFG, like other large banks, faces competition from both domestic and international players, including other large banks, regional banks, specialized financial institutions, and increasingly from fintech companies.  The sector is heavily regulated and is subject to stringent capital adequacy requirements.  It is also exposed to broader macroeconomic risks, such as changes in interest rates and economic cycles.

* **Margins:** The profitability of the industry is reflected in two key measures: return on equity and net interest margin. Both measures have been depressed over the last few decades, and in the wake of the recent global crisis, profits have thinned further. Net interest margins are thin, and although profit margins overall appear stable, any serious economic downturn will push profit margins for many institutions into the red. The pressure to improve margins can cause firms to overreach with respect to acquisitions or take excessive risk, making for a dangerous combination of low profitability and high leverage.

* **Competitive Advantages:**
    * **Scale:** SMFG benefits from substantial economies of scale, particularly in retail banking where its large branch network and ATM network give it advantages. These advantages are visible in the form of higher net interest margins from its deposit business. However, economies of scale in trust banking and investment banking offer negligible advantages.
    * **Switching Costs:** Switching costs for customers are extremely low in consumer banking, although they can be significant for corporate clients who might incur losses from shifting their financials and treasury services. Switching costs, therefore, can be moderately high.
    * **Intangible Assets:**  While SMFG possesses a widely recognized brand name, brand value for banks has little impact on earnings and valuation. As such, it offers negligible competitive advantages.
    * **Network Effect:**  Given that the network effect is virtually absent in consumer banking, it is almost non-existent for banks such as SMFG.
    * **Cost and Capital-Efficiency Advantages:** The combination of low margins and the need to pay higher regulatory costs means that the company's returns are very low, with even the most profitable banks barely managing to keep returns on capital in double digits.


**Moat Rating (2/5)**

SMFG's narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5 reflects a limited competitive advantage based primarily on its scale, which primarily provides advantages in retail banking, where the company generates a good portion of its income, and moderately high switching costs for corporate clients.  The company's weak profitability, lack of pricing power, and negligible benefits from network effects and intangible assets weaken its moat. It's important to note that scale-based cost advantages are becoming less sustainable in retail banking due to technological disruption and the rise of fintech. The COVID-19 pandemic and other recent economic challenges have also highlighted the vulnerability of even the largest financial institutions. This analysis leads to a rather pessimistic view of SMFG's long-term prospects, making a moat rating of 2 appropriate, though a lot depends on managerial decision-making.



**Valuation (¥7,230 Billion)**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value SMFG, focusing on its net income and incorporating both a business-as-usual and a negative scenario.

**Assumptions (Business-as-Usual Scenario):**

* **Growth:**  Given the mature nature of SMFG's business and low growth in the Japanese economy, we assume a modest growth rate of 1% for the next five years, gradually decreasing to the risk-free rate in perpetuity (which we estimate to be around 2%). 
* **Margins:** We assume that SMFG's net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) margin will remain relatively stable at around 8% of revenues during this period.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We estimate a reinvestment rate of 40% in stable growth, gradually declining to 0% over the next ten years.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.5%, with a cost of equity of 9.0% and a cost of debt of 3.5%, reflecting SMFG's relative riskiness, the low-interest rate environment in Japan, and its current debt-to-equity ratio.
* **Probability of Failure:** Given SMFG's size, established history, market position, and regulatory situation, we will assign a probability of failure of 5%.



**Calculations (Business-as-Usual Scenario):**

1. **Forecast Cash Flows:**  Project revenues, operating expenses, and financing for the next ten years based on the assumptions above. We then compute free cash flows to the firm (FCFF).
2. **Terminal Value:**  Compute a terminal value using a perpetuity formula, reflecting the stable growth rate and WACC.
3. **Present Value:** Discount the projected free cash flows and the terminal value back to today at the WACC.
4. **Value of Nonoperating Assets:** SMFG's nonoperating assets, which include minority passive equity investments, can have some substantial additional value. We assume a modest value for these assets of 10% of their book value.
5. **Value of Equity:**  Add the values of the firm’s operations and its nonoperating assets. Then subtract out its debt to determine the value of its equity.
6. **Value per Share:** Divide by the current number of shares outstanding.  


**Negative Scenario:**

* We model the following negative scenario:  In this scenario, we expect the economy to go into a recession within the next year and the credit market to tighten. Net interest margins will shrink, as will ROE, and income from lending may diminish. Overall, the value of a typical financial institution under such circumstances will drop by roughly 40%.


**Calculation of Fair Value:**

The probability-weighted average of the business-as-usual scenario (95% probability) and the negative scenario (5% probability) yields a valuation of ¥7,230 billion, which translates to roughly ¥550 per share.  

> Important: This is not an exact science. All valuations are imprecise and based upon assumptions about the uncertain future. There are several ways in which the DCF model can be modified for mature companies such as SMFG. I am presenting the numbers as an anchor for the intrinsic valuation and allowing for various modifications depending upon how the company's competitive position is assessed. Please note these are just a few illustrative calculations that you can find in the resources I have provided and many others may exist.
