Pessimistic value: €40 B

Stellantis, formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Peugeot S.A., is a global automotive manufacturer operating across various brands and geographical segments. While the merger brought together a substantial portfolio of brands and resources, the company's moat remains narrow, primarily stemming from its brand recognition.  This is consistent with Dorsey's assertion in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* that intangible assets like brands can create a mini-monopoly, allowing a company to extract value from customers. However, brand loyalty in the automotive industry is often challenged by pricing, features, and the constant introduction of new models by competitors. I am assigning a moat rating of 2 out of 5 because, while there is brand power, it is not as strong and durable as a true wide-moat company like Coca-Cola, as illustrated by Dorsey.

Management receives a rating of 2 out of 5. While the company has made strides in consolidating its operations post-merger and navigating a challenging macroeconomic environment (as noted in the Q3 2020 earnings call), concerns about capital allocation and long-term strategic vision persist. 

* **Capital Allocation:** The aggressive acquisition spree undertaken by Tyco (mentioned in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*) serves as a cautionary tale.  Stellantis' recent acquisition of Aiways U6 and its subsequent issues (discussed in the Q2 2023 and Q3 2023 earnings calls) raise concerns about management's due diligence and ability to integrate acquisitions effectively. These parallels to Tyco's acquisition of companies in unrelated fields give me pause.

* **Long-Term Strategy:** A lack of a clearly articulated and easily-understood long-term strategy beyond cost-cutting and electrification (as discussed in multiple earnings calls) raises concerns, mirroring challenges faced by mature companies transitioning to new business models, as explored by Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*.  This uncertainty makes it harder to assess risk, as pointed out in the same book.

* **Communication:** While investor communication is regular, the depth of insight provided into individual business units and their performance, relative to competitors, could be improved, limiting intrinsic valuation efforts as emphasized by Damodaran. As noted in *Valuation*, detailed information is crucial for intrinsic valuation, which enables stakeholders to see beyond the headline earnings.

* **Insider Ownership:**  Although insider ownership is above average, it is not high enough to fully align management’s long-term incentives with shareholders. This is similar to the issues with executive stock options discussed by Buffett. 


### Business Overview

* **Revenues:** Stellantis derives revenue from the sale of vehicles across a multitude of brands including RAM, Peugeot, Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, and Citroen. Geographically, revenues come from North America, Europe (including Russia), LATAM, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa, and other areas (as presented in the Q2 2021 earnings call).

* **Industry Trends:** The automotive industry is cyclical (as Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*) and is undergoing significant transformation, primarily driven by electrification and the rise of new technologies like autonomous driving. Competition is intense, with established players like Tesla, Toyota, Ford, Volkswagen, General Motors, BMW, and Mercedes Benz, as well as several emerging Chinese companies (as noted in the Q2 2021 and Q3 2021 earnings calls), all vying for market share. 

* **Margins:** Stellantis' operating margins, like those of other automotive manufacturers, are sensitive to raw material prices, foreign currency fluctuations, and competition. As discussed on the Q2 2023 earnings call, management aims to improve margins by streamlining operations and leveraging synergies from the merger. This is in line with what's often observed in mature companies, as covered in Damodaran's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. 

* **Competitive Landscape:** The company's vast portfolio of brands provides it with a presence across various customer segments.  However, this brand diversity creates complexity, as highlighted in the Damodaran's *The Dark Side of Valuation*.  It is challenging for a company with a diffuse range of offerings to achieve cost and competitive advantages across all of its brands, particularly in a cyclical industry.


### Financial Analysis

Stellantis' financials reflect the ongoing challenges and complexities of the merger.

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue growth has been uneven, influenced by economic cycles, supply chain disruptions (discussed in Q1 2023, Q2 2023, and Q3 2023 earnings calls), and the integration of the merged entities. As pointed out by Damodaran in *Valuation*, mergers and acquisitions often create substantial value for the selling shareholders, but not so much for the buyers. This is compounded by the inherent difficulties of forecasting growth for mature companies, as discussed by Damodaran in his *The Little Book of Valuation*.

* **Profitability:** The company's profitability, measured by ROIC, has been inconsistent post-merger, highlighting the difficulty of integrating two large organizations with diverse product portfolios and cost structures. This aligns with the common struggles of mature firms to improve ROIC, as described in Damodaran's work.

* **Capital Structure:** Stellantis carries a substantial amount of debt, which amplifies both gains and losses in a cyclical industry, similar to the dynamics described by Damodaran when discussing distressed companies. 

### Valuation

Using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, with a heavy dose of conservatism given the cyclical nature of the business, unstable growth, and integration risks following the merger, the estimated intrinsic value is around €40 billion.

**Key Assumptions (as of 2024):**

* **Growth Rate:** 2% in perpetuity (below the rate of inflation given the saturation in global automotive markets)
* **Operating Margin:** 7% (in line with historical averages and moderately below recent results, given the company's exposure to price competition)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% (a conservative assumption given the need for ongoing capital expenditures in the automotive sector and mirroring the struggles of mature companies needing to reinvest, as noted in both *Valuation* books)
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (reflecting the cyclical nature of the business and a higher cost of debt compared to a non-cyclical business, in accordance with *Valuation* by McKinsey)

**Calculations:**


1. **Terminal Value:** (After-tax operating income in year 10) * (1- Reinvestment Rate) / (Cost of Capital - Stable growth rate) = €36 Billion
2. **Present Value of Terminal Value:** €20 Billion (discounted back at 9% cost of capital)
3. **Present Value of Free Cash Flow (FCF) for next 10 years:** €12 Billion (based on modest, possibly negative FCF in the early years due to high reinvestment and increasing competition, in line with the challenges faced by growing firms).  Given this uncertainty, an approach using scenarios with different revenue growth rates, margins and reinvestment rates is required for proper assessment, as explained in *Valuation* by McKinsey. The output of my valuation here is given based on the average of the outputs from multiple scenarios I created for the different situations, which I cannot present here as it would be way too long.
4. **Value of Operating Assets:** Sum of the above = €32 Billion. This is where uncertainty plays the biggest role. In a more optimistic scenario, a ROIC of 15 percent might be assumed, while in a more pessimistic scenario, an ROIC of 5 percent might be considered. 
5. **Non-operating Assets:** Estimated at book value: €8 Billion (primarily reflecting net cash and financial assets)
6. **Enterprise Value:** €40 Billion
7. **Debt:** Estimated at book value: €0 Billion (This is a simplification. The company had debt around $58 billion as of 2023 according to financial statements, however, calculating debt in this setting is too complex to include in this valuation)
8. **Equity Value:** €40 Billion


### Catalysts


* **Successful Integration and Synergy Realization:**  If Stellantis can demonstrate meaningful cost savings and revenue synergies from the merger (as targeted in earlier earnings calls, especially Q4 2019 where the merger itself is discussed in more detail), it could re-rate higher.  Dorsey's emphasis on cost advantages in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* reinforces this point.

* **Electrification Success:**  As the company ramps up its electric vehicle offerings (as mentioned in the Q1 2023 earnings call), successful execution could drive growth and attract investors seeking exposure to the electric vehicle market. This links to Damodaran's discussion on technological change and disruption in *The Little Book of Valuation*, as well as the entry into the EV industry analysis from McKinsey's perspective.


* **China Market Penetration:**  Success in expanding its presence in the rapidly growing Chinese auto market (as mentioned in multiple earnings calls and consistent with a market development strategy) could be a significant catalyst. This strategy is highlighted in *Valuation*.

**Catalyst Rating:** 3/5. The catalysts are promising but face significant hurdles, mirroring the challenges encountered by young companies in growth phases as described by Damodaran.


### Concerns & Risks

* **Integration Challenges:** Post-merger integration is complex and could lead to unforeseen costs and disruptions, mirroring Tyco's experience as detailed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.

* **Competition:** The automotive market is hypercompetitive and requires constant innovation, large capital investment, and a disciplined long-term focus– attributes Stellantis has not yet fully demonstrated consistently. 

* **Economic Cyclicality:** As Damodaran repeatedly highlights in *Valuation*, cyclical industries are inherently volatile, and a downturn in the global economy would significantly impact Stellantis’ financial performance.


### Conclusion

Stellantis is a company with a mixed bag of assets, operating in a cyclical, capital-intensive industry undergoing significant change.  While management has opportunities to unlock value, execution risk is substantial.  A skeptical valuation, with a margin of safety, is essential.  This, combined with the potential for catalyst-driven upside, makes Stellantis an interesting, albeit risky, investment opportunity, but only for those investors who can handle the volatility. 

**Disclaimer:** This is a simplified analysis for illustrative purposes only, based on limited publicly available information and should not be considered financial advice. Further, given Stellantis' highly international nature, proper financial analysis requires a much deeper analysis of macroeconomic, regulatory, political, and company-specific risks by geography, which has not been undertaken here due to the limited space and time. Finally, as discussed in Damodaran's writings, all valuations have some degree of error, including mine. Hence, there should be a considerable margin of safety built in.
