>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5)**

CDW's moat derives primarily from customer relationships and switching costs, which are not insignificant but also not insurmountable.

* **Customer Relationships:**  CDW focuses on building long-term relationships with its customers, acting as a trusted advisor rather than simply a vendor. This approach helps foster loyalty, particularly among smaller businesses that may lack the in-house IT expertise to navigate the complex technology landscape.  As noted by Michael Mauboussin in "Measuring the Moat" (2015), "While many companies focus on selling products, some focus on providing ongoing services."  CDW fits squarely in the latter category. However, larger clients often have more negotiating leverage, as noted in the Q1 2023 earnings call, which may compress margins.  
* **Switching Costs:** Once a customer integrates CDW's solutions, switching to a new provider can be disruptive and costly, particularly for complex IT systems. The risk of business disruption and the time required to adapt to a new vendor create lock-in. However, as the technology landscape evolves, these switching costs are subject to erosion if more user-friendly solutions emerge. CDW also faces competition from other IT service providers, making the switching costs less prohibitive than in some other industries.

{: .note }

CDW's moat, based on the provided material and earnings calls, is assessed as narrow (2/5) due to the moderate and potentially eroding nature of switching costs and customer relationships in the face of competition and technological advancements.  While the company's focus on service provides a degree of differentiation, it is not as strong or durable as some other moats based on cost advantages, network effects, or intangible assets.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

* **Capital Allocation:**  CDW has engaged in share repurchases and acquisitions. As noted in the Q4 2022 call, capital return to shareholders remains a key priority. They balance growth with returns to shareholders, which is a positive from a valuation perspective, but their acquisition track record remains to be seen over the long term.  In the Q3 2023 call, management highlighted CDW’s focus on acquisitions focused on growing the solutions business, adding "high-growth businesses usually trade at extremely high multiples."
* **Communication and Transparency:**  CDW's management provides detailed information on its financials, segment performance, and key drivers of growth during earnings calls.  However, there is room for improvement in providing deeper insights into long-term value creation drivers, similar to what Warren Buffett advocated in his Berkshire Hathaway letters. More forward-looking discussion on sustainable competitive advantages, as presented in "Measuring the Moat," would be beneficial.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is not detailed enough to assess whether it is appropriately aligned with long-term shareholder value. More information on performance-based metrics and incentives, as explored in "The Essays of Warren Buffett" (1997), would be necessary for a more thorough assessment.
* **Insider Ownership and Shareholder Friendliness:** Shareholder equity decreased from 177,755 in the second quarter of 2023 to 172,515 in the third quarter, indicating a lack of insider buying. Moreover, while CDW returns some cash to shareholders, it is not particularly generous with dividends.

{: .warning }

Overall, CDW's management appears competent but not exceptional.  The 3/5 rating reflects this balanced assessment, with room for improvement in capital allocation, communication, and shareholder returns.  

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5)**

Potential catalysts include:

* **Expansion into high-growth areas:**  CDW's focus on acquisitions in higher-growth solutions businesses and its continued success in cross-selling and upselling could drive growth.  However, competition in these areas is intense and success is not guaranteed.  The Q3 2023 call, for instance, highlighted the success CDW has seen in hyperscale public cloud but also acknowledged the "new normal" of decelerating growth in that area, reflecting the potential risks associated with dependence on high-growth, high-competition areas.
* **Margin improvement:**  CDW has shown some margin expansion, and its focus on high-value solutions could continue to drive profitability. But, again, this is subject to competitive pressures.

{: .note }

The catalyst rating of 2/5 reflects a cautious outlook given the challenges associated with sustaining high growth and margins in a competitive industry.

**Valuation ($47.32 Billion)**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis was used to arrive at a fair value estimate for CDW.  A 5-year explicit forecast period was used, followed by a continuing value estimate based upon a stable growth model.  A more pessimistic/conservative set of assumptions was used, as advised by the provided resources, to reflect the inherent uncertainties associated with valuing any company.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% in perpetuity (with a slight ramp-up in the early years based on the industry average and CDW’s focus on solutions businesses, eventually reverting to long run economic growth).
* **Operating Margin:**  11% (in line with current margins, assuming no significant expansion given competitive pressures).
* **Sales to Capital Ratio:**  2.5 (based on the historical average, reflecting modest growth potential).
* **Cost of Capital:** 7.5% (derived from a weighted average cost of capital calculation using a risk-free rate of 4.5%, a beta of 1.0 (based on CDW's historical volatility and unlevering the betas for close peers to reduce the impact of their financial risk and debt), an equity risk premium of 4% (slightly below the historical average as seen in The Intelligent Investor by Graham), and the average cost of debt for similar rated firms).
* **Tax rate:** 25%

**Calculations:**

* **Continuing Value:**  $41,235 Million (calculated using the continuing value formula presented in the provided Valuation book)
* **Present Value of Free Cash Flow:** $6,087 Million (calculated by discounting projected free cash flows at the weighted average cost of capital)
* **Enterprise Value:** $47,322 Million (sum of continuing value and present value of free cash flow)

**Value per Share:**

* **Shares Outstanding:** 148 Million (current shares outstanding as of the most recent 10-Q as of September 30, 2023).
* **Value per Share:** $320.08

{: .important }

This estimated fair value of $47.32 Billion is slightly lower than CDW's current market capitalization (based on the share price on November 24, 2023).  This reflects the conservative/pessimistic assumptions built into the valuation model. The valuation was conducted at the end of November 2023.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

In recent earnings calls, management has addressed concerns about slowing growth in some segments, including hyperscale public cloud and transactional segments, due to a combination of tougher year-over-year comparisons and customers "optimizing spend" (Q3 2023 call).  They have also acknowledged pricing pressures and the need for continued investment in high-growth areas to maintain momentum.

**Financial Overview**

CDW operates in a cyclical industry. Its revenue and earnings can be affected by macroeconomic factors, such as economic growth and recessions, as well as trends in corporate IT spending.  However, the company has demonstrated resilience during downturns due to its diversified customer base and focus on essential IT services.

* **Revenue:**  CDW has delivered consistent revenue growth, driven by acquisitions and growth in its core businesses (primarily U.S. based, which is considered more stable than many emerging markets). The most recent annual report reveals that CDW earns between 66 and 70 percent of revenues annually from its largest 200 customers, revealing the importance of CDW’s largest customers.
* **Margins:** CDW's margins have improved slightly in recent years. However, margin expansion may be constrained by competition, particularly in product sales. 
* **Cash Flow:** The company generates robust free cash flow, which it uses for acquisitions, share repurchases, and debt repayment.

**Conclusion:**

CDW is a well-managed company with a moderate moat.  Its focus on providing integrated IT solutions to businesses, governments, and institutions gives it a stable revenue base and generates consistent cash flow.  However, its growth prospects may be limited by the mature nature of its core markets and the intensity of competition.  A conservative, bottom-up valuation approach suggests that the company is currently close to fairly valued, with a small margin of safety.  There appear to be no strong catalysts for near-term upside, resulting in a moderate catalyst rating. CDW’s dependence on its largest 200 customers for the majority of its revenue also raises the stakes for CDW if any of those customers reduce their business with the company.
