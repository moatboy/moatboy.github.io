{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

ASE Technology operates in a competitive industry. While the company enjoys some economies of scale, these are countered by the need for continual reinvestment in leading-edge technology.  Further, switching costs, while present, may be weakening in parts of the business as outsourcing becomes more prevalent.  Customer and brand loyalty in this segment are generally weaker than in consumer packaged goods.  The company’s integrated operations can provide a scale advantage for larger projects.  However, the company’s position in the industry may be insufficient to create enduring economic profits.

The company’s moat rating of 2 reflects the above.

**Management (3/5):**

Management has a long history in the industry and appears committed to maintaining a dominant market position.  Capital allocation decisions appear generally prudent, with a focus on reinvestment and debt levels that, while elevated, seem manageable.  Executive compensation appears to be a mix of cash and options, with employee stock option exercises having a dilutive effect on earnings per share.  Communication with investors appears adequate, but they have not been particularly forthcoming about the challenges faced by parts of their businesses, especially in maturing markets.

The management rating of 3 reflects a balance between positive historical performance and some concerns about capital allocation toward low-return businesses and the lack of more robust communication with investors.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for the company include continuing growth in the semiconductor industry, successful integration of acquisitions, expansion into new markets, and continuing cost reductions.  However, competition in the industry and the risk of technological disruption limit the catalyst rating to 2.

**Business:**

ASE Technology primarily serves large, U.S.-based electronic device manufacturers.  ASE Technology and its peers in advanced integrated circuit packaging compete to improve their margins by either raising prices or reducing costs or both.  This company has had some success in generating new business by moving existing customers into new product lines.

The semiconductor industry is cyclical and subject to substantial changes in demand and supply. In some parts of its business, the market is a relatively large, whereas in other parts it is more concentrated.  The company's revenue streams, as well as drivers of sales and profits, vary across its business segments, which must be analyzed separately.  ASE Technology's packaging operations rely on economies of scale, while its testing operations rely on tight integration with its customers.  Overall, its revenue streams break down as follows:

* **Testing services:** 40–45% of total revenue
* **Packaging services:** 50–55% of total revenue
* **Other services:** 5% of total revenue

**Financials:**

ASE Technology has shown impressive revenue and earnings growth over the last decade, driven primarily by increased outsourcing in the semiconductor industry. Profitability, as measured by return on invested capital (ROIC), has been attractive, averaging approximately 17%.

**Valuation ($17.73 billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used to value ASE Technology. Given the difficulty of forecasting long-term performance, a 5-year explicit forecast period was employed followed by a continuing value estimate based on a steady growth rate assumption.


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  5% annually (in line with historical GDP growth and reduced given the maturity of the semiconductor industry)
* **Target pretax operating margin:** 25% (in line with 2018 results)
* **Sales-to-capital ratio:** 1.0 (reflects capital intensity of semiconductor packaging and testing)
* **Tax rate:** 20% (reflects blended global tax rate)
* **Cost of equity:** 9% (risk-free rate of 2.1% plus an equity risk premium of 5.4% plus a country risk premium of 1.5%)
* **Weighted average cost of capital (WACC):** 7.6% (cost of equity of 9% at 56% weight plus cost of debt of 4.2% at 44% weight)

**Calculations:**

* **Continuing Value:**  $36,043 million, calculated using the key value driver formula with a sustainable growth rate of 3%, which was derived from the assumption that the ROIC in the continuing-value period would be equal to the company's cost of capital, in line with competitive equilibrium:


```
Continuing Value = NOPLAT<sub>t</sub> * (1 - g/ROIC) / (WACC - g)
```
* **Present Value of Operations:** $27,447 million, discounted at 7.6%


* **Current Enterprise Value:**  $31,263 million (Value of Operations of $27,447m  plus cash of $4,875m minus minority interest of $1,059m)


* **Equity Value:** $29,704 million (enterprise value of $31,263m less debt of $1,559m).


* **Value per share:**  $30.71, calculated as equity value divided by number of shares outstanding.



**Important Note:** The financial and macro-economic environment has been, and likely will remain, difficult to project accurately over longer periods. In addition, there are several other sources of uncertainty associated with this valuation, including sales and profit margins; the required investments in capacity, working capital, research and development, and acquisitions to deliver earnings growth; industry development, especially in emerging economies, and currency changes. You can test the stability of your solution by making small changes in one or two key parameters in your forecast. This stress test will provide valuable insights into the overall model and its sensitivity to errors in the model or in the data.
