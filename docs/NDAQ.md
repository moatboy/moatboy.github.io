{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Nasdaq benefits from modest network effects. As exchanges gain more buyers and sellers, they become more valuable to other buyers and sellers because of increased liquidity. However, in equity markets, the network effect is weaker because of the wide availability of alternative exchanges.  This weakens the competitive advantage offered by the network effect for Nasdaq. Furthermore, the rise of electronic communication networks (ECNs) and more recently, high-frequency traders has made it harder to extract economic profits from exchange-based trading, as discussed in *The Intelligent Investor*. ECNs reduce transaction costs and create fragmentation, limiting the benefits of any single exchange. Thus, I rate NDAQ's moat as narrow.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:**  Nasdaq has been active in acquisitions (e.g., Adenza), which present integration challenges.  However, the willingness to engage in deals in a growing industry is positive, especially as management emphasizes acquisitions as a growth driver.  The success of these acquisitions in creating long-term value remains to be seen. Adena integration and realization of associated cost synergies are key. Its history of capital allocation seems reasonable though not exceptional.
* **Communication:** Investor relations seem adequate. Management provides some information about individual business segments and discusses strategic objectives. However, there could be greater transparency about long-term value drivers, including the magnitude and sustainability of economic profits generated.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears to be largely performance-based, which can be positive. However, greater transparency could further improve alignment with shareholder interests.
* **Insider Ownership:** Information on insider ownership is limited in the provided documents.  However, insider ownership and alignment are important factors when evaluating management quality.
* **Overall:** While management appears reasonably competent, their aggressive acquisition strategy introduces risks. There's limited evidence of truly exceptional long-term value creation.  Thus, I am assigning a rating of 3 out of 5, reflecting a moderate assessment.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Adenza Integration:** Successful integration and cost synergy realization could boost profits.
* **Market Volatility:** A surge in trading activity would increase revenues, though this is not a sustainable long-term driver.
* **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in regulatory policy around market structure could benefit Nasdaq, however this is outside management’s control.
* **Overall:** While some potential catalysts exist, they are not powerful enough to warrant a high rating. I am therefore assigning a rating of 2 out of 5.

**Business:**

Nasdaq operates across three broad segments: Market Platforms, Capital Access Platforms, and Anti-Financial Crime.  

* **Market Platforms:** This segment generates the bulk of revenue (almost 70% in Q2 2023 as per the Q2 2023 earnings call) through trading, clearing and market data.  The company derives its revenue from trading mostly on a per-share basis with no fixed charges. It generates most of its revenue from equity transactions and some from fixed income. It has seen steady growth in its non-trading (data) revenue, which is less susceptible to market gyrations, as was discussed in its Q2 2023 earnings call.  Competition in the space has increased with the rise of ECNs and other exchanges, but Nasdaq remains a prominent player.
* **Capital Access Platforms:** This segment (approximately 20% of revenues in Q2 2023) includes listing services and investor relations. This is also a higher-margin business with relatively low competition.  However, growth may be limited as the addressable market is smaller than the Market Platforms market.
* **Anti-Financial Crime:** This segment (a little over 10% of revenues in Q2 2023) is a higher-growth business that helps protect markets from financial crimes, especially fraud and money laundering.  It serves an important function.

{: .note }

A key theme of the business is that it has recently moved from being a Market operator (Market Services and Market Technology) to an Information provider (Investment Intelligence), so Nasdaq could be seen by potential sellers and buyers as a high-growth company with less risk. However, the key to the success of this transformation rests on the ability of Nasdaq to integrate all these services into a coherent business model.

**Valuation ($28.7 billion):**

**Method:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

We'll use a 10-year DCF model, with free cash flow (FCF) as our key driver, following the methodology in *Valuation* by McKinsey. Because Nasdaq's biggest expenditures are mostly intangible, it is more revealing to value its operations rather than the entire enterprise. Nasdaq is a cash-rich company, which makes its equity trading at a lower price than its intrinsic value. Given Nasdaq is in the Market Services and Market Technology industry, I will use its industry's implied median cost of capital and free-cash flow to value the company.

**Key Assumptions:**

1. **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth will gradually decline from the current rate of 9% to a terminal growth rate of 3%.  This reflects the increasingly mature nature of the exchange business. This growth assumption is consistent with Nasdaq's revenue growth over the last five years as discussed in Q2 2023 earnings call.
2. **Operating Margin:** We assume that operating margins will stay flat at 53%. It is based on the median margin at comparable companies in the sector (see *Valuation* by McKinsey).
3. **Reinvestment Rate:**  We assume a reinvestment rate of 11% to achieve organic growth in the initial years (based on historical data provided for the years between 2020 and 2022), which we expect to decline to 5% in the terminal years. This is a pessimistic assumption about their growth relative to its peers in the sector.
4. **Cost of Capital:** The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated using a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity. We use Nasdaq’s end-of-2022 capital structure for this purpose (See *Valuation* by McKinsey and Exhibit 23.15 of  *Capital Budgeting*).  The cost of equity is 10.4%, based on a beta of 1.1 (relieved beta of other companies in Market Services and Market Technology) and a market risk premium of 4.5%. We use the U.S. 10-Year Treasury Bond rate of 4% as the risk-free rate. The cost of debt is 5.5%, which is based on a simplified spread (see Exhibit 11.10 of  *Capital Budgeting* )over 10-Year Treasury Bond given an A+ rating for the company. It is based on the credit ratings methodology in *Capital Budgeting*. The marginal tax rate of 25% is used (based on 2022 tax rate).
This leads to a cost of capital of 9 percent.

5. **Failure Probability:** We assume no failure probability for Nasdaq due to its strong performance, its high profitability, low risk of default, high credit rating and high cash balance, stable long-term position in an extremely attractive sector, and its low leverage, as well as reasonable long-term growth expectations as was discussed in Q3 2022 earnings call.

**Calculations:**

* **Terminal Value:** Using the key value driver formula, in conjunction with the preceding assumptions about continuing values,
Terminal value = (NOPLAT * (1 + g)) / (WACC-g) = $5.4 billion.

* **Present Value of Cash Flows:** Discounting the free cash flows and the terminal value at 9% (the weighted average cost of capital) gives a present value of cash flows of $23.3 billion.

* **Total Enterprise Value:** $23.3 billion + $4.2 billion (cash) = $27.5 billion.

* **Equity Value:** $27.5 billion + 1.2 billion(Other financial assets) - 0 (Debt, we do not expect Nasdaq to have net debt for a long time) = $28.7 billion.

{: .highlight }

Based on these conservative assumptions, the intrinsic value of Nasdaq is approximately $28.7 billion. This is lower than the company's current market capitalization (as of early 2024). While this may seem to suggest the stock is overvalued, it is important to remember that DCF valuations are highly sensitive to input assumptions.  Small changes in growth, margins, or cost of capital can substantially shift the final valuation.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

Nasdaq recently made a large acquisition (Adenza). As discussed in the Q4 2022 earnings call, this introduced execution and integration risk. Integrating Adenza fully will be critical to realizing the intended value from the transaction. The size of the deal also raises concerns about potential financial leverage. While revenue growth is impressive, recent concerns about economic growth and inflation, as well as the possibility of a recession in the United States, Europe, and China, could negatively affect Nasdaq, as was discussed in its Q4 2022 earnings call. However, given Nasdaq generates revenue from selling data, these risks may not affect Nasdaq, as it is more shielded than other business models from market forces.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* Successful integration of Adenza could significantly boost earnings and cash flow, boosting the stock price.  
* Continued growth in the Anti-Financial Crime segment could provide a new source of revenue growth, increasing market share, and higher margins.
* Regulatory changes in favor of Nasdaq could strengthen its competitive advantage.
* Market volatility is cyclical in the stock market, so this is not a sustainable long-term catalyst but trading revenues and equity income could be boosted if market volatility increases.

The overall outlook for Nasdaq is moderately positive. The company's recurring revenue and position in the growing financial technology sector provide a solid foundation for future growth.  However, investors should carefully monitor the integration of Adenza, as well as potential competitive and macroeconomic challenges.
