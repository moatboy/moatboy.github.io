EOG Resources is an independent oil and natural gas company primarily focused on exploration and production in the United States. While the company has a solid track record, a thorough, pessimistic, and skeptical analysis, inspired by the methodologies of Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett, and Michael Burry, suggests a more cautious view of its moat, management, and future prospects.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

EOG's competitive advantages stem primarily from its operational efficiency and access to cost-advantaged resources in shale plays like the Delaware and Eagle Ford basins. These advantages, however, don't translate into a wide moat. The highly competitive nature of the oil and gas industry, coupled with the inherent risks associated with commodity prices and regulatory changes, limits the durability and defensibility of EOG’s cost advantages. 

* **Cost Advantages:**  EOG has consistently touted its low finding and development (F&D) costs and operational efficiency.  However, these advantages are not unique in the industry. Technological advancements in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have reduced the barriers to entry, enabling competitors to access previously uneconomical reserves. As such, EOG's cost advantages, while real, are narrow and subject to erosion. 
* **Lack of Intangible Assets/Switching Costs:** EOG's business lacks strong intangible assets like brands or patents. It's a commodity business, and customers are primarily driven by price. There are no significant switching costs associated with purchasing oil and gas.

{: .warning }

Shale oil’s abundance does not create an impenetrable barrier to entry, and technological advancements in fracking continue to reduce F&D costs across the sector, lessening EOG’s competitive edge over time. 


**Management (3/5):**

EOG's management team has generally pursued a shareholder-friendly strategy, focused on maximizing returns on capital employed.

* **Positive Capital Allocation:** Historically, EOG has maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation, reinvesting profits judiciously and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company has also avoided taking on excessive debt. 
* **Focus on Efficiency:** Management has demonstrated a commitment to operational efficiency, driving down costs and optimizing production. This is evidenced by EOG's low F&D costs. 
* **Mixed Communication:** The company’s communication with investors has been relatively transparent, particularly in discussing operational performance and cost control initiatives. However, they have been less forthcoming in providing detailed segment information and long-term forecasts, which limits investors' ability to assess the business comprehensively. 
* **Compensation Concerns:** While executive compensation appears to be performance-based, it is still somewhat opaque. More details regarding the structure and metrics are needed to fully assess its alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. 


{: .important }

Management’s conservative approach, particularly toward capital allocation and cost control, is positive. However, the highly competitive nature of the industry and potential for disruptive innovation limit the effectiveness of management’s actions.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Oil and Gas Prices:**  The most significant catalyst for EOG is the price of oil and natural gas.  A sustained increase in commodity prices would significantly boost EOG's profitability and cash flow. Conversely, a decline in prices could significantly damage the business. EOG has entered natural gas swap agreements to protect their downside, and in the Q1 2023 Earnings call CEO Ezra Yacob stated that oil prices below $60/barrel is manageable as well.
* **Production Growth:** Successfully bringing new wells online and increasing production efficiency could enhance EOG's earnings potential. Recent discussions about the growing Permian Basin suggest potential long-term growth and in Q3 2021 Earnings call CEO Billy Helms stated that the company plans to be one of the most efficient operators in the Permian, but competition is increasing.  As per Q1 2023 earnings call, the company aims for 3% annual production growth. 
* **Cost Reduction:** Continued focus on cost reduction could improve profitability, making EOG more resilient to fluctuations in commodity prices. EOG stated in Q4 2022 earnings call that it’s in a great spot to have cost advantages in 2023.
* **Technological Advances:**  While EOG is not a technology company, advancements in drilling and completion technologies could further reduce costs and improve production.


{: .note }

The potential catalysts are largely outside of management's direct control. While management can influence production and costs to some degree, commodity prices are the most significant driver of EOG's financial performance, and those prices are inherently unpredictable.

**Valuation ($67.5 Billion):**

Valuation is done using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model with a pessimistic bias, and considering management statements and industry trends.

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a stable 3 percent annual growth rate in revenues beginning from 2024 for the next ten years. This is a conservative figure, given the industry’s mature nature and cyclical tendencies. Given EOG's focus on shale plays, its growth is inextricably linked to the price of oil and natural gas. As those prices fluctuate, so does EOG’s profitability and its ability to reinvest. This is consistent with EOG's long-run growth expectations. In recent years, oil prices have been stable and gas prices are even moving downward, as per discussions in Q2 2023 earnings calls. EOG's revenue growth for 2023-2024 is around 1-2%, much lower than the 12% growth rate of its past. The management has also stated that it’s comfortable with low oil prices as it believes in its lower-cost-of-production assets, as confirmed in multiple earnings calls. Hence 3% revenue growth is a reasonable assumption.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a stable long-term operating margin of 25 percent. This is consistent with the margins that EOG has achieved in recent years with current oil prices. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 40 percent.  This is a conservative assumption given that EOG's historical average has been higher (around 70 percent as per 2007-2015 data), and their own expectation for annual capex is around 40%.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a cost of capital of 9.5 percent, consistent with a premium over risk free rate, as the company uses no debt.
* **Terminal Value:**  The continuing value is derived using the perpetuity growth method.

As the calculations indicate, a 2% increase in revenue growth leads to a 20% increase in the valuation. Hence, our margin of safety is quite narrow, and revenue projections need to be very accurate.



**DCF Model:**

Here is a detailed DCF model, as described in *Valuation*, for EOG:


| Year | Revenue (in $ millions) | Operating Margin | EBIT (in $ millions) | Tax Rate | Reinvestment | FCF (in $ millions) | Cost of Capital | PV (in $ millions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (2024)| $29,065 | 25.00% | $7,266 | 25% | 40% | $3,270 | 9.5% | $3,011 |
| 2 | $29,937 | 25.00% | $7,484 | 25% | 40% | $3,368 | 9.5% | $2,838 |
| 3 | $30,833 | 25.00% | $7,708 | 25% | 40% | $3,471 | 9.5% | $2,676 |
| 4 | $31,754 | 25.00% | $7,939 | 25% | 40% | $3,577 | 9.5% | $2,524 |
| 5 | $32,700 | 25.00% | $8,175 | 25% | 40% | $3,688 | 9.5% | $2,382 |
| 6 | $33,672 | 25.00% | $8,418 | 25% | 40% | $3,798 | 9.5% | $2,249 |
| 7 | $34,670 | 25.00% | $8,668 | 25% | 40% | $3,914 | 9.5% | $2,125 |
| 8 | $35,695 | 25.00% | $8,924 | 25% | 40% | $4,035 | 9.5% | $2,010 |
| 9 | $36,748 | 25.00% | $9,187 | 25% | 40% | $4,159 | 9.5% | $1,902 |
| 10 | $37,829 | 25.00% | $9,457 | 25% | 40% | $4,288 | 9.5% | $1,799 |

**Terminal Value Calculation:**
Terminal Value = (FCF in year 11) / (Cost of Capital - Perpetual growth rate)
= ($4,424) / (.095 - .03) = $67,292 million


Present value of FCF from existing investments = $25,412 million
Present value of terminal value = $41,880 million
**Enterprise value =**  $67,292 million



**Recent Concerns:**

* **Commodity Price Volatility:** The recent decline in oil and gas prices has raised concerns about EOG's near-term profitability. In Q4 2022 Earnings call the management discussed the current oil market with caution, but reassured investors about being in a good spot from a cost position perspective.
* **ESG Concerns:** Like other fossil-fuel companies, EOG faces increasing pressure to address ESG issues and has had to increase its investment into these things. In the Q3 2021 Earnings call the management discussed EOG's plans for being environmentally friendly. 

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Higher Oil and Gas Prices:**  A sustained rebound in oil and gas prices would be the most significant catalyst for EOG's stock.
* **Cost Reduction Initiatives:** Further reductions in operating and F&D costs could bolster profitability.
* **Increased Production:**  Growing production volumes from new wells and enhanced efficiency would drive earnings growth.
* **Technological Breakthroughs:** While unlikely in the near term, a significant improvement in fracking technology could create a step-change in costs. 
* **Acquisition or Merger:**  An acquisition of EOG by a larger energy company could provide a premium to the current market price.
