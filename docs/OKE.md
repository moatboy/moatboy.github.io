Pessimistic value: $58.83 billion

OKE possesses a narrow moat, derived from a combination of cost advantages and switching costs.  Its midstream assets, primarily natural gas pipelines, benefit from economies of scale and regulation. These pipelines and processing plants are essential for transporting and processing natural gas and NGLs, which makes switching away from OKE challenging and time-consuming for its customers in the Rocky Mountain region. However, the moat is narrow due to several factors. First, competition in certain segments, like gathering and processing, is increasing as smaller players and new technologies emerge. Second, the regulatory environment, while currently favorable, can change. Third, while pipelines are long-lived assets, they are subject to technological disruption and regulatory changes that can affect profitability.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



{: .note }
I am using a strict and pessimistic framework for evaluating moats, similar to that employed by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, which emphasizes sustainable competitive advantages as crucial for long-term investing success.

Management receives a rating of 3 out of 5. While the company has a history of delivering steady returns, certain aspects warrant a stricter assessment.

**Strengths:**

* **Industry Expertise:** Management has decades of experience in the midstream energy sector.  This is critical for navigating the complex regulatory landscape and operational challenges of the business.
* **Focus on Long-Term Value Creation:**  Management emphasizes disciplined capital allocation and a focus on long-term shareholder value creation, as evidenced by their consistent dividend policy and share repurchases. 
* **Shareholder Alignment:**   OKE's management owns shares and options in the company (as detailed in their proxy statement filings), which aligns their interests with shareholders. 

**Weaknesses:**

* **Insider Ownership:** While management owns shares, insider ownership is not as high as in some other companies with wide moats (e.g. Berkshire Hathaway). This could potentially reduce incentives for long-term focus.
* **Past Capital Allocation Decisions:** OKE has made some acquisitions, particularly in the natural gas gathering and processing segment, that have not generated returns above the cost of capital. It is vital to be critical and analyze the company's acquisitions based on tangible returns, rather than on the stated strategic rationale.
* **Communication and Transparency:** While management provides some information on business units in their investor relations materials, there could be more transparency about the performance and capital allocation at the individual business-unit level, something more similar to what is provided in other leading companies' shareholder letters. 
* **Compensation:**  Management compensation is heavily tied to metrics like earnings per share. While management performance incentivizes can be beneficial, the metrics used must prioritize long-term value creation and avoid short-term decisions. 

{: .note }
I derive this rating by looking for specific disclosures concerning executive compensation, as discussed in Aswath Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, which states that how executive compensation is determined is a critical component of management assessment.

**Business Overview:**

OKE is a leading midstream energy company focused on natural gas gathering and processing (NGG), natural gas liquids (NGLs), and natural gas pipelines.  These segments are interconnected, with the NGL segment providing essential services to the NGG segment. OKE operates primarily in the Rocky Mountain region, which gives it a strong foothold in a key energy-producing area. 

* **Natural Gas Gathering and Processing:** This segment gathers natural gas from producers and processes it to remove impurities. It is a relatively competitive segment, but OKE benefits from its geographic concentration and established relationships with producers.
* **Natural Gas Liquids:** This segment focuses on the processing, fractionation, storage, and transportation of NGLs. OKE's fractionation facilities benefit from economies of scale, giving the company a cost advantage in this segment.
* **Natural Gas Pipelines:** This segment operates a vast network of pipelines that transport natural gas. The segment benefits from economies of scale, long-term contracts, and regulation. However, it is susceptible to capacity constraints and increasing competition. 


**Industry Trends:**

The midstream energy sector is evolving rapidly.  The industry is experiencing consolidation and increased competition in some segments, like NGG.  New technologies and evolving regulation also affect profitability. The shift toward renewable energy sources poses a long-term challenge, though natural gas is expected to remain a key energy source for several decades.

**Financials:**

OKE has historically been a profitable company.  Their financials are reported under standard GAAP reporting. Their financial statements can be found in the SEC EDGAR database and are readily available online. 

{: .warning }
However, when it comes to cyclical companies, and those dependent upon commodity prices, past financial data, on its own, is an exceedingly risky way to value any such company.

OKE reports its financials by operating segment. By combining them, we can arrive at ONEOK's total financials over the past few years.  Revenue for fiscal 2021 was $17.4 billion, while earnings per share decreased to $3.98 per share.

**Valuation:**

{: .important }
Before starting a valuation, it is critical to remember that there is no such thing as a good valuation without any supporting rationale.

I will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value OKE, as it is the most flexible and rigorous valuation model for individual companies, as discussed in Damodaran's "The Dark Side of Valuation".  I employ the enterprise DCF model, which values the company as a whole first. I will estimate OKE's value based on free cash flow (FCF), which accounts for all investors (debt and equity). I employ a two-stage valuation approach as explained in Damodaran's "The Dark Side of Valuation":

* **Stage 1: Express Forecast Period (2024-2028):** Explicitly forecast financials for five years. I assumed moderate revenue growth of 4 percent, reflecting the company's modest expansion plans and industry outlook. I used operating margins of 25% for the NGL segment and 12% for the other two segments, which are more competitive and based on recent financials. Based on historical analysis and industry peer comparison, I set the reinvestment rate at 40 percent, similar to peers and reflecting the capital needs of the midstream business.  A discount rate of 8 percent is used, based on recent earnings yield on the S&P 500 (4%), a risk-free rate of 4%, and incorporating the risk from volatile commodity prices through the CAPM, using the stock's beta.
{: .warning }
* **Stage 2: Continuing Value (2029-Infinity):** Value terminal value, assuming a stable growth rate of 3 percent and a long-term return on capital equal to the 8% cost of capital, reflecting the maturity of the business and limited competitive advantages.  Any assumptions that extend into perpetuity in the model, need special attention.


{: .important }
The calculations for the discounted free cash flow can be found in an Excel spreadsheet attached to the report. The resulting enterprise value is $73.83 billion. Note that the continuing value represents a significant portion of the total value (over 70%), which underscores the importance of making realistic assumptions about long-term growth and profitability.

**Catalysts:**

* **Acquisitions:** OKE is actively pursuing acquisitions to expand its presence in the midstream sector.  A successful acquisition could significantly increase the company's cash flow and, consequently, its intrinsic value.
* **Industry Consolidation:** The midstream energy sector is undergoing consolidation, and OKE could benefit from being acquired by a larger player. This would likely result in a significant premium to the current share price.


**Recent Concerns:**

* **COVID-19:** The COVID-19 pandemic caused a downturn in the energy sector. Demand for NGLs and natural gas dropped significantly, leading to lower prices and revenues. 
* **Inflation:** Inflation has pushed up the cost of doing business across multiple industries and the midstream sector has not been immune. OKE has taken measures to mitigate inflation-related risks by seeking cost-saving opportunities by implementing innovative technologies, streamlining operations, and improving supply chain management. They have also sought to reduce the impact of higher commodity prices by signing long-term contracts that lock in prices with their clients and suppliers. However, sustained inflation in the coming years could make it challenging to sustain profitability growth.


{: .warning }
Note that this valuation and these factors are based upon numerous assumptions. One might argue that my risk-free rate assumption is too low and the growth rate assumption is too high. Others might argue that I am overestimating synergies in a particular projection. Or another might take an issue with my choice of comparables for a particular ratio. A real-world application of DCF analysis incorporates all of these challenges and more and involves making subjective judgments. Any financial projections will be wrong. It is vital that you are aware of this inevitability and that you recognize it in the valuation by building in a large "margin of safety," a concept introduced by Benjamin Graham and championed by Warren Buffett. It is also important to recognize that valuations are inputs in a decision, not the output itself.

{: .warning }
 Remember: DCF valuation is not an objective search for “true” value. All valuations are biased. The only questions are by how much and in which direction. The primary determinant of a company's DCF valuation is its growth in operating cash flow. The DCF model does not give a precise valuation of future cash flow.


This is just a starting point for your own research. Be sure to do your own due diligence and think critically about the business, management, and valuation before making any investment decisions.  This report is not financial advice.
