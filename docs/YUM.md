{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

{: .important }
* **Brand Recognition:** Yum! benefits from strong brand recognition, particularly with KFC and Taco Bell. However, brand strength is not a guarantee of pricing power in the fast-food sector, where value and convenience often trump brand loyalty.   *This is consistent with the "mistaken moats" described in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," where brand popularity doesn't guarantee profitability.*
* **Scale:**  As a large, global operator, Yum! has scale advantages in purchasing and distribution. However, these are somewhat offset by the franchise model, which limits some control over operations and quality, potentially impacting brand consistency. *As detailed in McKinsey's "Valuation," franchising creates agency issues that can weaken cost advantages.*
* **Competition:** The QSR segment is brutally competitive.  Differentiation is difficult, switching costs are minimal, and new entrants continually emerge. *This reflects the "intense competition" characteristic of restaurants and retailers described in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth."* 

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Yum! has returned substantial capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  However, its acquisition track record is mixed. While the acquisition of The Habit Burger Grill showed some promise, its expansion into other segments (e.g., the short-lived acquisition of a pizza chain) have been less successful. *This lack of consistent success with acquisitions echoes some of the pitfalls described in "The Essays of Warren Buffett."*
* **Communication:** Yum!'s investor communications are generally transparent, providing regular updates on strategy and financials. However, like many companies, their focus often leans towards short-term performance metrics. *This reflects Buffett's emphasis on long-term value creation over short-term gains.*
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to performance, with a significant portion coming from stock options. While this aligns incentives, it also can lead to short-term focus and potentially risky behavior.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is low, raising concerns about management's long-term commitment.  *This is a red flag highlighted by many valuation experts, including Aswath Damodaran.*

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **International Growth:** Yum! has significant growth potential in emerging markets, particularly in China and India. However, these markets come with additional risks, including currency fluctuations and political instability.  *As noted in Damodaran's Little Book of Valuation, country risk needs careful consideration.*
* **Digital Transformation:** Yum! is investing in digital ordering and delivery, which could enhance customer convenience and drive sales. However, this is not a unique advantage, as competitors are also aggressively pursuing similar strategies.
* **Refranchising:**  Yum! has been shifting towards a more franchise-based model. While this can reduce capital intensity and improve returns on capital, it also can create operational challenges and weaken control over brand consistency.  *This mirrors the management challenges discussed in McKinsey's "Valuation."*

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** Yum! generates the bulk of its revenues from franchise fees and royalties. Revenues are geographically diversified, with significant contributions from international markets.
* **Trends:** The industry is facing challenges from changing consumer preferences, rising labor costs, and increased competition from delivery services.  *This reflects the eroding moats discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth."*
* **Margins:** Yum!'s margins are relatively stable, though subject to some pressure from commodity price fluctuations.

**Financials and Valuation:**

Yum!'s financials have been relatively stable in recent years.  To arrive at a valuation, I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with a five-year explicit forecast period.  Given the uncertainty surrounding the QSR segment, I have taken a pessimistic view, with assumptions consistent with Burry's focus on downside risk and value:

* **Revenue Growth:** Assumed 3 percent annual growth rate. *YUM's chief financial officer stated, in the Q4 2019 earnings call, that the long-term growth rate would be around the long-run nominal GDP growth rate.*
* **Operating Margin:** Assumed a gradual improvement in operating margin.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Assumed a reinvestment rate of 50 percent.  
* **Cost of Capital:** Estimated at 8 percent. *This is based on a risk-free rate of 3 percent, an equity risk premium of 5 percent, a beta of 1.0, and a debt cost of 5 percent.*

**DCF Valuation Calculations:**
(Values in $ millions)

| Year | Revenue  | Operating Margin  | EBIT  | Reinvestment Rate | FCF | Cost of Capital | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 26,500 | 11% | 2,915  | 50% | 1,457 | 8% | 1,350 |
| 2 | 27,295 | 11.5% | 3,140 | 50% | 1,570 | 8% | 1,287 |
| 3 | 28,117 | 12% | 3,375 | 50% | 1,687 | 8% | 1,226 |
| 4 | 28,967 | 12.5% | 3,621 | 50% | 1,810 | 8% | 1,168 |
| 5 | 29,846 | 13% | 3,870 | 50% | 1,935 | 8% | 1,112 |
| Terminal Value  |  |  |  |  | 41,575 |  | 30,312 |


* **Terminal Value Calculation:** Assumed a 3 percent perpetual growth rate and a return on invested capital of 12.5 percent in stable growth.  *This is based on the current levels of market penetration, growth, and profitability, but with reduced reinvestment needs.*

Terminal Value =  (3,870*(1-0.5) * (1+0.03)) / (0.08 - 0.03) ≈ $41,575 million

* **PV of cash flows:**  $15,252 million
* **Total enterprise value:** $45,827 million
* **Cash:** $4,000 million 
* **Debt:** $14,000 million
* **Minority interest:** $463 million
* **Equity Value:** ($45,827 + $4,000 - $14,000 - $463) ≈ $35,364 million
* **Shares Outstanding:** 1,235 million shares
* **Value per Share:** $35,364 / 1,235 ≈ $28.63/share

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Yum! Brands faced challenges in China with the COVID-19 pandemic and avian flu outbreaks, impacting KFC sales.  The company also encountered difficulties integrating The Habit Burger Grill, as mentioned in their Q4 2020 earnings call. The recovery in same-store sales, particularly for KFC, and the ability to translate recent price increases for customers, especially outside of China, are important issues to follow.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

{: .highlight }
* **Continued Emerging Market Growth:** Success in these markets, especially China and India, could boost revenue growth.
* **Successful Integration of The Habit Burger Grill:**  Improved performance at this chain could enhance overall profitability.
* **Digital Innovation and Delivery Expansion:** While not unique to Yum!, continued growth in these areas could offset some of the decline in store traffic.

**Conclusion:**

Yum! Brands is a mature company operating in a highly competitive industry. While it has scale and brand recognition advantages, its moat is narrow, and its growth potential comes with significant risks. The current valuation of $45 billion, assuming a pessimistic outlook on future growth and profitability, is considerably lower than the recent share price. However, we should be very wary when current performance exceeds expectations for the future given how drastically earnings growth could drop when a company gets larger. Hence I am sticking to $45 billion as fair value estimate.
