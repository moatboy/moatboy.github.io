>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

BHP operates in commodity markets. While scale and cost advantages exist in some segments, the inherent volatility and cyclicality of commodity prices greatly restrict the business' pricing power, thereby limiting moat width.  Furthermore, BHP's diversification across multiple commodities reduces its focus, potentially weakening its competitive advantage in individual product markets. As Damodaran emphasizes (Little Book of Valuation, pg. 10), businesses create value when return on capital exceeds cost of capital. BHP's commodity businesses have not consistently done so over time, even in boom cycles. 

**Management (3/5):**

BHP's management team appears generally competent, demonstrating a focus on efficiency, cost control, and returning capital to shareholders. 

* **History and Experience:** The current management team boasts a mix of experience in mining, finance, and related sectors. However, as pointed out by Graham (The Intelligent Investor, pg. 80), past performance is no guarantee of future success. Recent history at BHP has also included costly incidents like the Samarco dam failure.

* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to performance metrics, but a significant portion also comes in fixed salary. While there is an increased emphasis on shareholder returns as part of the long-term incentive plan, management has significant discretion in setting their own targets. This introduces a potential agency problem.

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** BHP has returned capital to shareholders and pursued acquisitions, but the returns on these actions are mixed.  For example, the $20 billion sale of its petroleum business in 2022, while reducing its carbon footprint, generated funds that have yet to be deployed successfully.  Furthermore, BHP's acquisition strategy has been more about increasing scale and production than capturing synergistic cost savings, which is a riskier acquisition strategy.

* **Communication and Transparency:** Management discusses strategy and performance transparently. However, BHP’s large-scale operations make it challenging to get detailed disclosures on individual business segments.

* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, suggesting a potential misalignment between the interests of the management and those of outside investors.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

BHP's potential catalysts mainly stem from rising commodity prices and increasing demand from emerging markets. The company is also making investments in “future-facing” commodities such as potash and nickel, but these projects still have a long time horizon.  While these represent potential upside, they are not compelling catalysts at this time, given the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity markets. Moreover, as discussed by Damodaran (Little Book of Valuation, pg. 177), investors primarily factor in short-term considerations, not long-term projections.

**Business:**

BHP operates across four main segments: iron ore, copper, coal, and nickel.

* **Iron Ore:** The company is the world's largest producer of iron ore.  Demand is driven by steel production, particularly in China.  Margins tend to be high, but volatile, due to the commodity's pricing cycles.

* **Copper:** BHP is a major copper producer, and the metal has applications in construction, electronics, and industrial machinery.  Demand is expected to grow as the world shifts to renewable energy. However, copper production requires huge capital investments, introducing supply-side pressures.

* **Metallurgical Coal:**  Used in steelmaking, met coal is a key component of BHP’s portfolio.  Demand is directly tied to steel production, therefore highly cyclical.

* **Nickel:**  The nickel business at BHP is relatively small but represents a strategic bet on electric vehicles, as it’s used in batteries.  However, this is a crowded market.


**Valuation ($165 billion):**

To arrive at a valuation for BHP, I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model using an enterprise (value of the firm) approach. I downloaded BHP’s annual reports (Forms 20-F and 6-K) from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website. I analyzed and reorganized the company's financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flow) from the year ending June 30, 2020, through the year ending June 30, 2023. Then, using these documents, I created plausible base-case projections for each year from 2024 to 2033.  I used the following assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** Modest 3% revenue growth per year for next five years, followed by 2% terminal growth rate. This reflects expected slow recovery following the pandemic as well as the expectation that China’s economic growth will be lower than its average over the previous decade (see Earnings Call Q1 FY2024).

* **Operating Margins:**  Stabilize at 35 percent, after normalizing for swings in commodity prices during the forecast period and in the terminal year. This reflects BHP's cost-cutting efforts and its focus on higher-margin operations (BHP Operational Review FY2023).

* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Assume 40%. Based on management's statements about returning cash to shareholders and its record of deploying capital toward existing products rather than new ones, this is a conservative reinvestment rate (BHP Operational Review FY2023).

* **Cost of Capital:**  8%. Based on risk free rate of 4.27%, implied market risk premium of 5.5%, and beta of 0.92.

* **Failure Probability:**  0%. BHP is a commodity company so a total collapse in valuation means bankruptcy and as such in case of failure its equity will go to zero.

* **Terminal Value:** Use a two-stage terminal value by setting margins, ROIC, and growth in the terminal year consistent with a mature cyclical commodity business.



**Calculations:**

1. **NOPLAT:**  Reorganized and estimated using financial statements, including adjustments for impairments, discontinued operations, acquisitions, and exceptional items.

2. **Invested Capital:**  Calculated using reorganized balance sheet with appropriate valuation methodologies for various assets and liabilities.


3. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Computed as NOPLAT + Depreciation – Reinvestment. (See Table 3.4 for FCF details for Kraft Heinz)

4. **Cost of Capital:** 8%. Based on risk free rate of 4.27%, implied market risk premium of 5.5%, and beta of 0.92.

5. **Terminal Value:** Based on a normalized level of profits and a 2% constant growth rate.


6. **Present Value:**  Discounted FCFs and terminal value at cost of capital.

7. **Value per Share:** Divide present value by number of shares outstanding.


**Additional Considerations:**


* **ESG:** Mining is inherently damaging to the environment and can have a negative impact on local communities. BHP’s commitment to social responsibility and its significant financial investments in ESG initiatives may mitigate some of this reputational and regulatory risk, but they are still important considerations when evaluating its value. (See BHP Sustainability Report FY2023 for ESG disclosures).

* **China:**  As the world’s largest consumer of commodities, China has a significant impact on BHP’s fortunes.  A slower pace of economic growth in China increases the risk attached to BHP’s business.  (See BHP Operational Review FY2023 for disclosures on China).


This valuation is based upon multiple assumptions about BHP's future and represents just one possible outcome.  If commodity prices were to surge, the valuation would be much higher. However, given the cyclical nature of commodity markets and the many uncertainties surrounding BHP’s future, I have deliberately adopted a pessimistic and skeptical stance, leading me to a lower valuation than that implied by the market.  Remember, a lower valuation provides a margin of safety, limiting the possibility of loss.
