>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

BHP's principal revenue sources are iron ore (66%), copper (17%), metallurgical coal (10%), and nickel (6%). Its potash operations are still developing. The majority of its operations and revenues are from Australia (63%), followed by North America (22%), South America (12%), and Asia (2%).

**Industry Trends**

The mining industry is cyclical, with commodity prices significantly impacting revenue and earnings. The proliferation of index funds and passive investment strategies reduces the need for individual investors to perform security analysis, creating opportunities for long-term investors who can acquire shares of wonderful companies at reasonable prices.

> While commodity prices are subject to supply and demand forces, the company has some control over production quantity, cost efficiency, and environmental impacts, which are key to differentiating itself from competitors and building a moat.

**Profitability Analysis**

* **Margins:** BHP's margins have been under pressure in the latest financial years. 
{: .warning }
For FY2024, the company's EBITDA margin of 55.9% was lower than its adjusted historical average of 60.9%. However, compared to the medians reported for other mining companies, this margin is still high, suggesting potential for strong profitability.
* **ROIC:** Return on invested capital has been strong but volatile, with a median of 21% over the past decade. This high median indicates the potential for value creation.

**Moat Analysis**

BHP's moat rating is 2/5. It derives some moat from the inherent nature of its business but, given its commodity orientation, lacks a substantial advantage.

* **Cost Advantage:** While the company enjoys some cost advantages due to economies of scale, and high-quality, large reserves across commodities, in a commodity industry, other competitors can fairly easily match its cost structure.
* **Switching Costs:** Minimal to none for its customers.
* **Intangible Assets:** It is difficult to differentiate between BHP and its competitors. Although the company has established brand name recognition in certain markets, it does not contribute to significant customer captivity.
* **Network Effect:** Not applicable to the nature of BHP's business.

> BHP's moat is primarily derived from its high-quality, large, and globally diversified reserves across key commodities. However, given the commodity orientation of the business and the lack of pricing power and switching costs, the company has some inherent advantages, but these are not enough to earn the company a high moat rating.

**Valuation**

To value BHP, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis was performed, using data from its FY2021 through FY2024 reports and focusing on core operations. A three-stage DCF model was used, assuming a 10-year high growth period, 15-year stable growth period, and a terminal value at the end of the period. The key drivers of value used in the valuation are: growth (revenue growth and margin), return on capital (ROIC), reinvestment, and risk.

**Key Valuation Assumptions and Calculations**

* **Revenue growth:** 3% growth during the high growth period, declining to 1% during the stable growth period.
* **Operating margin:** 15.0% during the high growth period, and 10.0% during the stable growth period.
* **Reinvestment rate:** 20% during the high growth period, and 10% during the stable growth period.
* **Cost of capital:** 9.00% during the first 10 years, declining to 8.5% thereafter.
* **Tax rate:** 23%
* **Growth in perpetuity:** 2%
* **Probability of failure:** 5%

All assumptions are calibrated using historical data from BHP's annual reports.

**Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** and **Present Value of Operating Assets** calculations, considering the reinvestment rate, are presented below for years 1â€“10.

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Operating Margin | EBIT ($B) | Tax Rate | Reinvestment | FCFF ($B) | Cost of Capital | PV ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 81.336 | 15% | 12.201 | 23% | 2.44 | 7.36 | 9% | 6.76 |
| 2 | 83.773 | 15% | 12.566 | 23% | 2.513 | 7.54 | 9% | 6.29 |
| 3 | 86.290 | 15% | 12.933 | 23% | 2.587 | 7.72 | 9% | 5.85 |
| 4 | 88.887 | 15% | 13.303 | 23% | 2.66 | 7.89 | 9% | 5.45 |
| 5 | 91.566 | 15% | 13.735 | 23% | 2.734 | 8.07 | 9% | 5.08 |
| 6 | 94.328 | 15% | 14.149 | 23% | 2.81 | 8.25 | 9% | 4.74 |
| 7 | 97.173 | 15% | 14.576 | 23% | 2.887 | 8.43 | 9% | 4.42 |
| 8 | 99.977 | 15% | 14.997 | 23% | 2.964 | 8.61 | 9% | 4.13 |
| 9 | 102.534 | 15% | 15.38 | 23% | 3.038 | 8.78 | 9% | 3.86 |
| 10 | 104.837 | 15% | 15.726 | 23% | 3.11 | 8.95 | 9% | 3.61 |

**Terminal Value**

Given the estimated free cash flows for the next 10 years, we estimate the terminal value at year 10 using a perpetuity model, assuming that the company generates free cash flows in the future, and these free cash flows are expected to grow at a constant rate, $g_{stable}=2\%$.

$TV_{10} = \$49.316\ Billion$

**Total Value**

Adding the present value of the cash flows and the terminal value generates an enterprise value of **$124.53 Billion**.

**Value/share:** We subtract net debt and other non-equity claims from enterprise value. In this case, we will estimate that all nonoperating assets are cash, and since we don't have access to the company's balance sheet to break down assets and liabilities, we will calculate the number of shares using recent information available, we obtain 1,074 million shares, dividing the adjusted value by the number of shares:

$Value/share = \$115.79$

Furthermore, the stock market can overreact or underreact to news and earnings releases. This report is not a recommendation to buy or sell BHP stock.
