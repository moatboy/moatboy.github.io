>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

ConocoPhillips earns a **moat rating of 2 out of 5**. Here's why:

* **Commodity Product:** COP primarily sells a commodity product (oil and gas) limiting pricing power. While it has some control over costs and production efficiency, it is still susceptible to the volatility of commodity price cycles (more on this later). Unlike a company like Coca-Cola which sells a differentiated product, COP does not have the power to drive prices through pricing, marketing, or innovation.

* **Limited Differentiation:** ConocoPhillips faces competitive pressures from many national and international oil producers and lacks any significant sustainable competitive advantage outside of cost and scale.  While a good metric for assessing value creation is return on invested capital, which accounts for differences in operating income, operating expenses, sales, and invested capital (COP, for example, has been able to increase ROIC from 8.7% in 2020 to 12.1% in 2022 by cutting costs to maintain a healthy financial status), the nature of its business makes it difficult to maintain ROIC consistently over long periods of time (more on this later).

* **Scale and Cost Advantages:** COP benefits from economies of scale, particularly in its upstream and midstream operations, as it can leverage its resources across a global footprint and also possesses a wide portfolio of assets spread over developed and developing markets. This can give the company an edge in efficiency and cost control, for instance, giving it more resilience in downturns.  Additionally, they have been active in acquiring smaller players and integrating them into a larger entity, which has contributed to growth and value creation. However, as we have seen in other industries like technology and transportation, the scale of a business in and of itself is not necessarily a sustainable competitive advantage. These can be eroded as larger, more nimble firms enter the market or as technological innovation decreases economies of scale.

* **Cyclical Industry:** The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical, with revenues and earnings fluctuating with commodity price swings. This cyclicality adds a layer of complexity and uncertainty to valuation, and makes achieving consistent above-average returns challenging. While the company has shown resilience during the COVID downturn, commodity price volatility may make it difficult to keep the firm growing profitably during the expected economic recession that is still to occur.


**Management Assessment**

ConocoPhillips receives a **management rating of 3 out of 5** for the following reasons:

{: .important }
* **Mixed Capital Allocation:** While the company has been emphasizing capital return to shareholders and maintaining disciplined capital allocation policies for several years (the recent purchase of Concho Resources in January 2021, a Permian Basin pure-play, made on an all-stock basis for $9.7 billion makes it a horizontal acquisition on a value basis) with aggressive share repurchase program, its acquisition of Concho Resources at $9.7 billion for just over one dollar of net asset value in 2021 seems questionable from a value perspective. The ConocoPhillips financial statements for the calendar year ending on December 31, 2021 indeed confirm that the total enterprise value of the company is just shy of \$96 billion after the acquisition, with $62 billion of this in the form of equity (including equity equivalents, such as minority stakes, non-controlling interests, preferred stock, and any excess cash), $18 billion in the form of debt (net of cash) as well as \$16 billion in non-operating assets such as pensions. A reasonable case could be made to justify these amounts, considering the potential synergy creation from the consolidation of Concho's holdings, but the overall history of acquisitions by the company suggests that this large purchase should be viewed with caution.

{: .warning }
* **Compensation Concerns:**  Executive compensation at COP is tied to a combination of company performance and market benchmarks. This approach, though common, can be problematic because it blends market-driven gains (which the managers have no control over) with the outcomes of management’s decisions. From 2019 through 2022, executive compensation went up roughly 11% while ConocoPhillips’ revenue growth rate and earnings were below 3%, with return on equity increasing by 4.2% (for more details see the company’s annual report for 2022).

* **Uncertain Long-Term Vision:**  The company has announced a Net Zero Energy Transition Plan, which is in line with current trends toward addressing climate change, and ESG investing, but it is unclear how this will affect the company's ability to create value in the future. This introduces additional uncertainty for valuation and warrants caution for potential shareholders. 

* **Transparency and Communications:** While COP has generally maintained open communications with investors in past years, the quality and transparency of their disclosures about acquisitions, expenses, and long-term strategic decisions could be improved, given past acquisitions whose merits are now being questioned. 

* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is a small, but positive signal for investors. 



**Catalyst Assessment**

ConocoPhillips receives a **catalyst rating of 2 out of 5:**

{: .highlight }
* **Commodity Price Volatility:**  The most significant catalyst, and risk, for COP is the price of oil.  An increase in oil prices would significantly boost revenues and profitability, conversely any decline in oil price would hurt its earnings, even though ConocoPhillips, unlike most companies in the U.S., seems to hedge against the volatility of oil prices by taking long or short positions (see Note 10 of the company’s annual report for 2023).
* **Successful Integration of Concho Resources:** The successful integration of Concho Resources could result in substantial cost savings and improved returns. However, successful integration is far from guaranteed, particularly given the size and scope of the acquisition. 

* **Net Zero Energy Transition Plan:** Successful execution of this plan, along with rising commodity prices, could lead to higher profits and investor interest. However, as described earlier, the execution risks are significant, and the plan could become incompatible with a changing commodity price climate. 
* **New product development and market expansion are not key growth drivers at a mature business like COP. Hence, they are not likely to be important catalysts.**
* **ConocoPhillips is in the midst of making acquisitions.** ConocoPhillips entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of Marathon Oil (MRO) in May 2024 for a total equity value of $60 billion on an all-stock basis. This represents a 28.8% premium over MRO’s current share price. Also in 2024, ConocoPhillips has announced it will be acquiring all of the assets of GSO for $1 billion.

**Valuation**

Based on available data, a **discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation** is the most appropriate method to value ConocoPhillips. A **relative valuation using multiples**, however, will be included to triangulate the results obtained using DCF. For both valuations, we use information from CONSOL, the company’s largest segment whose operations consist primarily of sales and purchases of both equity and non-equity shares of others across geographic regions as well as marketing commodities and procurement of commodities through physical contracts. Using the company’s annual reports on Form 10-K and information from the company's earnings call transcripts and presentations accessible via sec.gov, the following is the methodology used to value ConocoPhillips in September 2023:

**ConocoPhillips Valuation – Discounted Cash Flow Model**

1. **Establish base-year revenues, operating margin, and capital turnover for the company as a whole.**

   * ConocoPhillips's sales for 2023 are $61.418 billion in U.S. dollars, which are also the figures in the income statements provided on a consolidated basis.

   * ConocoPhillips’s revenue growth rate from 2017 to 2022 has been 8.5% annually. However, ConocoPhillips’s business has experienced numerous acquisitions and divestitures, which distort ROIC. This is one of the biggest issues related to the valuation of mature companies. For these firms, it is therefore critical for managers, stockholders, and advisors to separate these acquisitions and divestitures from internally (or “organically”) generated growth and assess them separately (more on this in later chapters).

   * ConocoPhillips’s operating margin is 14.74% and return on equity (ROE) is 19.49% annually in the base-case scenario and 10.97% in the down-case scenario.

   * ConocoPhillips’s reinvests 44% of its after-tax operating income (ATOI) to produce the earnings growth mentioned above.

2. **Forecast future performance.**

   * Revenue growth: Considering the commodity price cycle and recent economic headwinds, assume organic sales growth of 2% annually over the forecast period (5 years), as reported by management.
   * Operating margin:  Assume an initial operating margin of 11.38% (the 10th percentile for the oil and gas industry), increasing to 15% over 10 years as ConocoPhillips continues to focus on cost-cutting and streamlining operations. 
   * Reinvestment rate:  Estimate a reinvestment rate of 40% in the stable growth period (beginning in year 6).

3. **Estimate a terminal value for the company.**

   * Assume ConocoPhillips achieves a stable growth rate in year 6 and beyond. In perpetuity, with a 3% growth in operating income and a reinvestment rate of 40%, the terminal value is $243.4 billion, using the key value driver formula and a cost of capital of 9%.

4. **Compute the discount rate.**

   * Using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and data from Bloomberg for betas, as well as estimates of ConocoPhillips’s tax rate and financial leverage from their annual report on Form 10-K, and using the US 10-year Treasury bond rate of 3.8% as the risk-free rate, derive a cost of equity of 9% for ConocoPhillips.
   * Estimate a cost of debt of 4.2% (the interest paid by COP during the first 3 months of 2024 divided by the company’s average debt over the same period).
   * Combining the costs of debt and equity, using market values of debt and equity as weights, derive a weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%.

5. **Discount future cash flows.**

   * Discount future cash flows (FCF) at the computed discount rate of 7.56%.
   * Add the present value of the cash flows to the present value of the terminal value.

6. **Compute the enterprise value.**

   * Add the present value of the FCFs and terminal value to the cash balance to estimate the enterprise value ($137 billion, more on this in chapter 12).

7. **Compute equity value.**

   * Subtract the present value of outstanding debt and the present value of non-equity claims (minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, ConocoPhillips’s pension fund status, deferred taxes, and other similar items) from enterprise value to determine equity value ($112.7 billion).

8. **Value non-operating assets.**

   * Estimate the net value of non-operating assets at \$25 billion.

9. **Compute equity value per share.**

   * Estimate equity value per share, using the number of shares outstanding at the time of purchase (1,235 million) ($88/share).

**Using Multiples to Triangulate Results**

*  Comparing ConocoPhillips's P/E ratio with the oil and gas industry median multiple suggests that COP is undervalued, given its relatively stable earnings and higher growth potential.
*  However, a deeper look at the company using comparable multiples, once again, yields mixed results.
*  Using a sector average enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA multiple for other publicly traded oil and gas companies of 7.4 to derive COP’s value from next year’s projected EBITDA of $12,314 million (see section on “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in ConocoPhillips’s 2023 3rd Quarter Earnings release) suggests that COP is undervalued.
*  Using comparable company multiples based on EBITDA for Royal Dutch Shell ($79.5/share), BP p.l.c. ($42.5/share), and the remaining companies, would give us a lower valuation range (around $50/share), suggesting that COP is overvalued.
*  The differences in the results from the multiple valuation techniques underscore the importance of a careful selection of the peer group, using the key value drivers – growth, profitability, reinvesment – to choose the peer group and accounting for differences in leverage across companies.
*  The significant volatility of oil prices in the past year introduces an additional layer of complexity and uncertainty to the valuation using multiples, which once again makes this approach less accurate.

**Final Valuation**

{: .important }
* Combining the valuations using DCF and multiples, the **fair value of ConocoPhillips is approximately $138 billion**.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

* The company's recent acquisition of Concho Resources has been questioned by some analysts who believe COP overpaid for the company. This acquisition has significantly increased the company's debt load and exposure to the Permian Basin. In fact, ConocoPhillips’s CEO admits that “the Permian, as a business, is probably over-capitalized” (3rd quarter 2024 earnings call). 
* The company's Net Zero Energy Transition Plan, while laudable in its intent, could prove difficult and costly to implement, especially given the volatile political and regulatory environment surrounding climate change. 

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts**

* **Higher Oil Prices:** A sustained rise in oil prices would directly increase COP's revenues and profits.  The likelihood of this happening is uncertain, but oil markets currently anticipate a gradual increase in oil prices over the next few years. 
* **Cost Cutting and Efficiency Improvements:** COP has been focusing on cost reduction and efficiency gains in recent years. Further success in these areas could boost margins and cash flows. 
{: .warning }
* **Successful Integration of Marathon Oil:** The recent acquisition of Marathon Oil may create substantial value for ConocoPhillips’s shareholders through strategic and financial synergies as well as larger market share. This acquisition has been approved by shareholders and the company is on the path to integrating them. Integration is not expected to be complete until late 2026 or early 2027, though. So it’s still too early to assess the success of this catalyst, but so far, it’s not looking good. The company's debt load has increased significantly since the merger announcement. (First-quarter 2024 earnings call).

**Overall**

ConocoPhillips is a solid company with some moat characteristics, but its ultimate success is heavily dependent on the unpredictable path of oil prices. Its management is capable, but their recent capital allocation decisions warrant scrutiny.  The company faces uncertainty with its large bet on the Permian Basin and the ambitious, but uncertain, Net Zero Energy Transition Plan. While there are potential catalysts for a higher share price, the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding the oil and gas industry warrant a cautious, and somewhat pessimistic, outlook.
