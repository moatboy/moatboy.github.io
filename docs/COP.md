>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** ConocoPhillips operates in several geographic regions: Alaska, Lower 48 (U.S.), Canada, Europe, Middle East & North Africa, Asia Pacific, and Other International. The Lower 48 and Alaska segments contribute the most to total revenues, while international operations (primarily Europe and Asia Pacific) provide the remainder.  Their revenue mix is almost entirely commodity-based, heavily dependent on oil and natural gas prices.
* **Industry Trends:** The oil and gas industry is cyclical and subject to commodity price swings. Currently, the industry is undergoing a period of consolidation, with larger companies acquiring smaller ones. While environmental regulations are increasing, demand for fossil fuels remains robust, particularly in emerging markets. Technological innovation has lowered costs and increased access to previously uneconomical reserves.
* **Margins:** ConocoPhillips's margins are tied to commodity prices. Higher oil and gas prices lead to higher profit margins, and vice versa. While there are periods of higher margins, competition works to erode these excess returns over time, pushing profit margins down.
* **Capital Allocation:** ConocoPhillips has generally returned capital to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. However, a key consideration is their strategic shift to acquire companies or assets.  Empirically, the most value is created when companies invest in growth projects, but management must make an appropriate judgment about what to acquire. Acquisitions can also be used to increase profits when weaker competitors are driven out of the market during a downturn, allowing a stronger company to increase market share at a bargain.


**Moat Analysis:**

ConocoPhillips's moat rating is a **2 out of 5**, indicating a **narrow** moat. The company's primary sources of competitive advantage are as follows:

* **Low-Cost Production:** ConocoPhillips benefits from having some low-cost operations, particularly in certain shale plays in the U.S. This allows the firm to remain profitable even when commodity prices are low. However, this advantage is not insurmountable, as technological advances diffuse rapidly, and other low-cost producers can emerge.  Further, there is evidence that low cost production by itself is a less powerful moat than sustainable differentiation or innovation.
* **Scale:** As one of the largest independent E&P companies, ConocoPhillips has some scale advantages in certain areas, such as negotiating transportation costs and accessing capital. However, the industry is still relatively fragmented, and smaller, more nimble competitors exist.
* **Intangible Assets:** ConocoPhillips's brand name carries some weight, though nowhere near as much as the big integrated majors like ExxonMobil and Chevron.  Further, brand name is a less durable form of competitive advantage than others, as a brand's profitability depends on how much it influences consumer behavior.

Overall, ConocoPhillips's competitive advantages are not as strong or durable as those of other companies with wider moats.  Commodity price fluctuations can significantly affect company performance, and management's execution risk remains. A change in management or new trends in the energy sector could also potentially damage the company's competitive positioning.



**Valuation:**

{: .warning }
A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis was conducted using financial statements from 2017 to 2022 and the latest company filings, along with projections from Morgan Stanley research. The financials reflect a period of economic recovery in oil markets.
**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  For the next five years, revenues are assumed to grow at an average rate of 3 percent per year, reflecting conservative projections for oil price growth.
* **Operating Margin:**  A target operating margin of 18 percent is assumed, which is at the lower end of the historical range for ConocoPhillips, reflecting pessimism about the long-term potential for higher margins in a competitive industry.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** A reinvestment rate of 45 percent was derived, based on the historical reinvestment needed by the company to sustain a moderate growth rate in a cyclical industry.  
* **Cost of Capital:**  A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56 percent was used, based on a cost of equity of 9.00 percent and an after-tax cost of debt of 4.27 percent, reflecting cost of equity premiums during the 2000s and a current cost of debt of 2.7 percent.
* **Terminal Value:** In the terminal year, growth is assumed to be 3 percent (U.S. risk-free rate), and a return on capital is assumed to be 10 percent.  A perpetuity growth formula and the key-value driver formula (and its related earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization variant)  was used, resulting in a terminal value of $49.316 billion. 

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  FCF was projected for the next 10 years, based on the revenue and margin assumptions, and incorporating reinvestment needs and taxes.

2. **Present Value of FCF:**  The projected FCFs were discounted back to the present using the WACC.

3. **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value was calculated using the perpetuity growth formula and the key-value driver formula.

4. **Enterprise Value:** The present value of FCFs and the present value of the terminal value were summed to arrive at the enterprise value.

5. **Value of Nonoperating Assets:**  Nonoperating assets, primarily cash and short-term investments, were valued at their book value.

6. **Value of Debt and Other Non-Equity Claims:**  The total of debt and other non-equity claims was estimated using company financials.

7. **Value of Equity:**  The value of equity was calculated by adding the value of nonoperating assets to the enterprise value and then subtracting the total value of debt and other non-equity claims.

8. **Value Per Share:** The value of equity was divided by the number of shares outstanding.

**Results:**

{: .warning }
Based on these pessimistic assumptions, the estimated intrinsic value of ConocoPhillips is **$107.87 billion**, or **$87.79** per share.  This is somewhat below the current market price, but within a reasonable range, given the uncertainties of the commodity business. It is important to note that this valuation is highly dependent on the price of oil and gas, and a change in the commodity cycle could change the valuation significantly. Also, be certain that if a firm or industry has historically generated returns below the cost of capital, its future value may not be all that attractiveâ€”the odds of the firm or industry turning around are not that great, even if you have a very clever management team. Finally, remember that this valuation gives you only a point estimate of ConocoPhillips's value today, but we recommend constructing a value range as we've done here, using at least three different scenarios.
**Additional Notes:**

* This valuation is based on a simplified DCF model. A more sophisticated model would incorporate additional factors, such as commodity price volatility and the potential for acquisitions or divestitures.
* This valuation is based on publicly available information. A more in-depth analysis would involve speaking with management, competitors, and industry experts.


This valuation should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell ConocoPhillips stock.  It is merely an estimate of the company's intrinsic value based on a set of reasonable but pessimistic assumptions. It is essential to conduct your own research and analysis before making any investment decisions.
