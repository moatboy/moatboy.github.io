>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Moat (2/5):**

Valero's moat is narrow. While the refining industry has high barriers to entry due to substantial capital investments required to build new refineries, there are also several existing players, creating a competitive landscape. VLO's scale, distribution network, and geographic reach (as we see in its 2023 10K and other filings) do provide some cost advantages. However, these advantages are not insurmountable and can be eroded by changes in regulations, technological advancements, and shifts in consumer preferences.

Valero's moat is primarily derived from its refining business. The complexity of refinery operations and the sheer size of VLO create some barriers to entry. However, VLO has several competitors and the industry is prone to periods of intense rivalry. Also, alternative fuels are a potential threat, although not an immediate one.

**Management (3/5):**

Valero's management team appears capable and is focused on returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. 

>The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program has been completed and a new program was authorized in the first quarter of 2021 (2021 Share Repurchase Program), increasing the total authorization from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion (VLO 2021 10-K). This suggests that management believes its shares are undervalued, a belief that often proves to be correct for the savviest managers.

{: .highlight }

>From 2019 to 2021, Valero returned over $7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, more than two-thirds of which went toward share repurchases. This emphasis on returning capital to shareholders is generally a positive sign (VLO 2021 10-K). 


{: .note }

>However, while VLO's operating income nearly tripled from $5.3 billion in 2015 to $14.8 billion in 2022, the share price increased only by 40 percent over the same period. Furthermore, VLO’s market value relative to its book value as of the end of 2022 was lower than its peers (VLO 2022 10-K). Thus, management's capital allocation decisions have not created much value for shareholders.


Additionally, CEO turnover in recent years (Joe Gorder since 2014) raises a few concerns. While Gorder seems to have done a decent job, longer tenures offer greater stability and a more consistent approach to value creation. Finally, executive compensation appears reasonable but not exceptional, and insider ownership is low, reducing the alignment of incentives with shareholders. 

**Catalyst (2/5):**

>Valero is expanding its Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) business, a renewable fuel joint venture, which is expected to significantly increase the company's production of renewable diesel over the next few years.

{: .highlight }

>Valero's refining segment, specifically its Port Arthur refinery, will also likely benefit from the IMO 2020 regulation, which aims to reduce sulfur content in marine fuel oil.

{: .highlight }

>On the cost side, Valero expects to benefit from recent improvements in DGD operating and maintenance expenses, lower operating lease costs, lower general and administrative costs and lower non-cash incentive compensation (VLO Q3 2023 earnings call).

These developments could act as catalysts for the company, but it's difficult to assess their potential impact with certainty. The renewable diesel market is becoming increasingly competitive, and regulatory changes could affect the profitability of VLO's traditional refining business.

**Business:**

Valero's business consists primarily of three segments: Refining, Renewable Diesel, and Ethanol.

* **Refining:** This segment includes VLO’s 15 petroleum refineries located in the United States, Canada, and the U.K., along with its extensive pipeline network. 
* **Renewable Diesel:** This segment includes two large renewable diesel plants, one in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana and the other in Port Arthur, Texas.
* **Ethanol:** This segment includes 11 ethanol plants located in the Midwest region of the United States.

>We expect ethanol margins, specifically in the United States, to recover with a better margin environment in 2021 (VLO 2020 10K).

The refining industry is cyclical, and VLO's earnings can be volatile, although VLO’s earnings tend to be more stable than smaller refiners. The company operates in a competitive environment with other large, multinational companies. Differentiation comes primarily from cost advantages and efficient operations, rather than product quality or innovation.

**Financials:**

>Overall, VLO's margins have been strong historically, especially compared with other refiners, despite some softness in 2019. However, VLO's margin declined substantially in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the company had an increase in margin in 2021, its trailing twelve month revenue and margin still remain low relative to historical levels, as stated in the company's 2021 10-K report.

{: .warning }

>Moreover, in the 2023 report, sales of petroleum and other feedstocks decreased by $3.3 billion in the first nine months due to declining margins and lower throughputs. VLO’s financial performance for the second quarter of 2023, in particular, was worse than expected by analysts (VLO Q2 2023 earnings call).

VLO maintains a healthy balance sheet with a conservative debt level. The company has consistently generated positive cash flows.

**Valuation ($48.72 Billion):**

To value Valero, a two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model was used. The financial projections are based on consensus analyst estimates for the next five years, with conservative assumptions used for long-term growth and ROIC.

1. **Explicit Forecast Period (2024–2028):**
    * Revenue growth: Starts at 3 percent and declines gradually to 2 percent by 2028. This decline is due to the increasing competitive environment in the industry.
    * Operating Margin: Improves to 9 percent by 2028, which is the average margin between 2015 and 2019.
    * Reinvestment rate: Remains at 45 percent, which is VLO’s average reinvestment rate from 2015 to 2019.
    * Sales/Capital: 2.34.
    * Tax Rate: 24.2%.
    * Cost of capital: 7.8%
    * Cost of equity: 9.00%.
    * Cost of Debt: 4.28%.


2. **Continuing Value Period (2029–Forever):**
    * Growth rate: Declines to 2 percent, the long-run growth rate of the U.S. economy.
    * ROIC: Declines to 9 percent, which is in line with VLO’s peers in the market and a historically persistent level.
    * Reinvestment rate: 40 percent.


>Applying the discounted cash flow valuation model yields an intrinsic value of $48.72 billion. This is approximately 1.22 times VLO’s book value of equity.


The following tables (from 2023 VLO 10K) show the projections for VLO. All figures are in millions of dollars.


| Year | Revenue | EBITDA | Capital Expenditures | Working Capital | Depreciation | Free Cash Flow |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2024 | 160,117 | 11,739 | 6,257 | 2,117 | 4,683 | 684 |
| 2025 | 166,868 | 12,266 | 6,460 | 2,181 | 4,736 | 706 |
| 2026 | 173,863 | 12,817 | 6,671 | 2,248 | 4,790 | 729 |
| 2027 | 181,125 | 13,394 | 6,892 | 2,317 | 4,845 | 754 |
| 2028 | 188,675 | 14,001 | 7,123 | 2,389 | 4,902 | 780 |


**Closing Thoughts:**

Valero is a reasonably well-managed company with a narrow moat in a cyclical industry. The company faces challenges from increasing competition and regulatory uncertainty. The stock price has been volatile in recent years. Given the uncertainties in the oil and gas industry, a DCF valuation using pessimistic parameters and a margin of safety seems appropriate.
