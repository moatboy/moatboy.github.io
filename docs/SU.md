>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Suncor possesses a narrow moat, primarily stemming from its integrated business model and cost advantages. The integrated model provides some cost benefits and insulation from commodity price swings. However, these advantages are not absolute.  Like other integrated energy giants, Suncor has significant refining operations, and refining margins can be extremely volatile. As discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, true moats stem from structural characteristics that make it difficult for competitors to replicate a company's success. While integration provides some advantages, it does not create the same level of competitive protection as, say, a network effect (like Visa or Mastercard) or high switching costs (like Oracle). Further, other integrated energy companies can, and do, compete directly with Suncor.

**Management (3/5):**

Suncor’s management team gets a middling rating.

* **Positives:** The company has a long history of dividend payments, demonstrating some focus on shareholder returns. In recent years, the management has emphasized debt reduction and share repurchases, which suggests capital discipline and shareholder value creation. Their recent focus on optimizing operations and cost reductions through initiatives like the autonomous haulage system are also positive signs, as highlighted in the 2020, 2021 and 2022 AIF and earnings calls.
* **Negatives:** Like many commodity businesses, Suncor's financial performance is highly dependent on commodity prices (the "macro" factor). As seen in Michael Mauboussin's "Measuring the Moat", and Aswath Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, exceptional management should demonstrate an ability to generate excess returns through skillful capital allocation decisions across commodity price cycles. Suncor's history is more of being along for the commodity price ride and does not show the same degree of outperformance. The company's significant oil sands investments, while profitable at higher oil prices, require massive capital expenditures and long lead times, limiting flexibility. As highlighted in Damodaran's lectures, this makes valuation very sensitive to commodity price assumptions. The management team’s commitment to return on invested capital seems less robust than other capital allocators (e.g., Warren Buffett). Their compensation practices, while not egregious, do include stock-based incentives, which as discussed in Buffett's essays can sometimes create misaligned incentives.  Further, insider ownership appears moderate. Finally, the recent safety incidents at Suncor’s operations, a recurring topic in the 2019-2023 earnings calls, indicate problems with operational management and safety culture and raise questions about the efficacy of management oversight.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Suncor's most important catalyst is a continued oil price recovery.  However, forecasting commodity prices is inherently uncertain and unpredictable, as described in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, and Benjamin Graham’s *The Intelligent Investor*.  The management’s emphasis on cost cutting, improving production efficiency, and modernizing operations (AIF and earnings call transcripts 2019-2023) may marginally improve its competitive position, but it’s a commodity business, and these improvements are likely to be passed on to consumers as lower prices in the long run. Additionally, while there is some potential for value creation through industry consolidation (discussed in the Morgan Stanley report "Industry Analysis"), the timing and magnitude of any impact on Suncor are uncertain.

**Valuation ($46 billion):**

To value Suncor, we use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Because the company has substantial mining activities, we will value its oil-sands operations using a two-stage DCF and its other businesses, oil exploration and production, refining and marketing, and corporate and eliminations, as a continuing perpetuity. We've taken a conservative approach, assuming:

1. **Revenue Growth:** We assume modest revenue growth in line with the long-term global GDP growth rate (2% real growth over next 10 years as assumed in the 2015 MSCI report), given the cyclical nature of commodity businesses and a mature industry landscape.
2. **Margins:** We expect ongoing operational efficiencies to provide incremental operating margin improvement in Suncor’s Oil Sands segment, tapering off over time. Margins in its other segments will remain relatively stable.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:**  Given the mature nature of the business, we assume a declining reinvestment rate over the next 10 years.
4. **Cost of Capital:** Based on the May 2009 average credit spreads (Damodaran presentation), a blended cost of capital around 9% seems appropriate. For the Oil Sands business, we discount cash flows over a longer time horizon (25 years), leading to a cost of capital of approximately 10%. This assumes the Oil Sands business is riskier than the downstream business.
5. **Terminal Value:** For non-Oil Sands businesses, the continuing value assumes a 2% growth rate in perpetuity, consistent with long-term global GDP growth. For oil sands operations, we assume a 1% terminal growth rate and cost of capital of 12%, reflecting our view that the future price of oil will be materially lower in the terminal period, given increased investment in renewable energy.
{: .warning }
6. **Risk of Failure:** Given recent financial difficulties and production challenges, we estimate 30% probability of business failure in the next 10 years, with liquidation value equal to the firm’s cash balance.
> This high failure rate may seem extreme, but is used to incorporate pessimism about future commodity prices and the company’s execution. Given the nature of commodity businesses, even a well-managed company can succumb to low prices. 

* **Calculations:**
    * **Oil Sands:** $15 billion (see attached image). Note that a significantly lower perpetuity price assumption results in much lower value. 
    * **Other Businesses:** $37.5 billion (see attached image). 
    * **Total Intrinsic Value:** $52.5 billion (sum of two segments)


    * **Less:** Debt: -$6.7 billion (assumed stable over period)

    * **Equity Value:** $45.8 billion


    * **Divided by:** Shares outstanding: ~1 billion


    * **Intrinsic Value per share:** $45.8

**Additional Information:**

* **Recent Concerns:** Safety issues at Suncor’s operations are an ongoing concern and could result in reputational damage, regulatory fines, or production delays.  The management team (2019-2023 earnings calls) believes it is taking appropriate steps to address these concerns, but history suggests these issues may be more intractable than they acknowledge. The company is also exposed to oil price volatility and the transition to renewable energy sources, as discussed in several 2019-2023 earnings calls.

* **Potential Catalysts:** Beyond a continued rise in commodity prices, the company’s efforts to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve safety could boost shareholder returns.  However, any positive impact from these factors is likely to be muted by the highly competitive and cyclical industry landscape.  Additionally, the appointment of Rich Kruger as CEO in 2023 and his prior turnaround experience at Imperial Oil (2019-2023 earnings calls), is hoped will be a driver of significant value creation.

{: .important }

> **Disclaimer:** This is just one potential valuation scenario, and different assumptions about future oil prices and Suncor’s execution would generate very different results. Given the sensitivity of discounted cash flow models to inputs and the difficulty of predicting those inputs precisely, especially for a company operating in a highly cyclical industry, any valuation must be treated with caution.
