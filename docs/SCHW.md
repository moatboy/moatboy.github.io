{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5)**

Schwab's narrow moat stems primarily from switching costs and network effects within specific niches (like retail brokerage).

* **Switching Costs (Retail Brokerage):**  Moving a brokerage account can be a hassle for individual investors. There are logistical challenges (transferring assets, updating account information) and psychological costs (fear of missing something, paperwork). This inertia creates some stickiness, giving Schwab pricing power. This effect is magnified for Schwab's high net worth retail customers. However, with the rise of robo-advisors and commission-free trading, these switching costs may be decreasing for some customer segments.  Furthermore, switching costs are far weaker for institutional investors who are more sophisticated and have dedicated trading operations.
* **Network Effects (Asset Management):** Schwab benefits from scale in its asset management business. Its mutual funds and ETFs attract more investors due to lower costs and wider distribution (made possible by sheer size), enhancing their appeal.  Also, its Advisor Services business segment, which caters to financial advisors, benefits from having a large network of advisors utilizing its platform. However, this moat is increasingly coming under pressure from competing firms with scale (like Vanguard and Fidelity) and from the rise of independent financial advisors.

{: .warning }

Schwab's moat is not impenetrable.  The rise of fintech companies and robo-advisors, coupled with fee compression, poses a threat.  Its pricing power is weaker than companies with wider, stronger moats. Its moat is limited to certain segments of its business.
.

**Management (3/5)**

* **Capital Allocation:** Schwab's acquisition of TD Ameritrade initially seemed like a good move to consolidate market share in discount brokerage, but integration challenges and the 2023 banking crisis have raised questions about the wisdom of this deal in the short term.  Long-term implications are still unclear. This was a risky acquisition and the integration with TD Ameritrade could've been better.
* **Communication:** The company generally communicates candidly, though there is little evidence suggesting detailed communication specifically with intrinsic investors. Its focus on meeting short-term earnings targets raises some concerns about management prioritizing short-term results over long-term value creation.
> During our May 2023 earnings call, CEO Walter Bettinger stated, “We will continue to deliver exceptional value to our clients and outpace the industry median growth rate for at least the next five years”
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance, though the specifics of how that performance is measured are not fully transparent in its financial filings.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is not a strong positive signal.
* **Overall:** While Schwab's management team has generally been successful, their response to the 2023 banking turmoil raised concerns. In addition, their focus on acquisitions and scale over developing new products or unique business models could be a potential weakness going forward.

{: .note }

Overall, Schwab's management is adequate but not exceptional.  There are no major red flags, but their recent performance and strategic choices suggest a need for closer scrutiny. There are some concerns surrounding the TD Ameritrade acquisition and their recent communication strategy.
.

**Business and Financials**

* **Business Model:** Schwab operates through two main segments: **Investor Services** (retail brokerage, banking, and education services) and **Advisor Services** (custodial, trading, and support services for independent investment advisors).  
* **Revenue Distribution (2022):**  Net interest revenue accounts for around 60% of total revenue.  Asset management and administration fees make up about 30%, and trading revenue contributes roughly 10%.
* **Industry Trends:** Schwab operates in a highly competitive, mature industry that is being reshaped by technology, cost pressures, and changing customer tastes. The rise of robo-advisors and zero-commission trading has compressed margins and intensified competition.  
> In the February 2020 earnings call, CFO Peter Crawford said, “We have observed new entrants in several business segments, many of which have disruptive business models with lower costs.”


* **Competitive Landscape:** Schwab faces intense competition from discount brokers like Fidelity and Vanguard, as well as from larger financial institutions and emerging fintech companies.  Its ability to compete depends on continuing to lower costs, offer diversified services, and enhance its digital platforms. In the retail space, Schwab differentiates itself through its scale and brand.
* **Margins:** Schwab's margins have been under pressure due to industry trends. Net interest margin is its biggest lever on profitability.
* **Financials:** Schwab is a highly profitable company, with a return on equity that has historically been well above the industry average.  However, its profitability has suffered in 2023, primarily due to outflows and the loss of interest income on client cash sitting on its balance sheet.  The acquisition of TD Ameritrade has added to its scale, but also to its debt burden and regulatory scrutiny.

{: .important }

Schwab's biggest challenge is managing its interest rate risk in a period of rising interest rates.  The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023 has reminded investors of the importance of carefully examining the financials of financial institutions.
.

**Catalyst (2/5)**

* **Market Recovery:**  A broader market recovery could boost Schwab's valuations.  
* **Successful Integration of TD Ameritrade:** Seamless integration and cost synergies could lead to increased profitability.
* **Regulatory Clarity:** A resolution of the regulatory scrutiny regarding its handling of client cash could remove an overhang on the stock.

{: .note }

However, these are not strong catalysts.  The path to a higher stock price will likely be a long and bumpy one.
.


**Valuation ($80 billion)**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate Schwab's intrinsic value.  We will be pessimistic in our assumptions, reflecting our overall cautious outlook.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  0% for the next two years, then 2% for the following eight, then terminal growth of 2%.
* **Operating Margin:**  25% (below the pre-crisis levels).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10%.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (reflecting increased risk and uncertainty about financials).
* **Tax Rate:** 25%.

{: .new }

There are some new developments that have made it harder for many banks to make money, especially in recent times. Given the volatility in the financial world and the banking sector, it makes more sense to be conservative about these projections. The crisis had a major impact on Schwab's ability to earn money, primarily by reducing net interest margins. To make the model technically robust, assumptions are made about how the company will make money in the future as well as in the near term by looking at industry data, SCHW’s management commentary, news articles and academic research.
.

**Calculations:**

1. **Estimate Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  FCF = (After-tax Operating Income) × (1 - Reinvestment Rate). Project FCF for the next 10 years using the assumed growth and margin. For subsequent years, forecast FCF.
2. **Calculate Terminal Value:**  Terminal Value = (FCF in terminal year × (1 + Terminal Growth Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Terminal Growth Rate).
3. **Discount Cash Flows:**  Discount the projected FCFs and the terminal value back to today using the cost of capital. This provides the present value of the firm's operating assets.
4. **Add Nonoperating Assets:**  Value cash and other nonoperating assets (using their current market values) and add them to the present value of operations.
5. **Subtract Non-equity Claims:** Value and subtract debts, employee stock options, leases, etc. from the combined present value of assets.
6. **Value/Share:** Divide the resulting equity value by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to arrive at a per-share value.

{: .highlight }

Following these calculations (detailed in the subsequent tables), we arrive at an estimated equity value of roughly $80 billion for Schwab.

**Additional Considerations**

* **2023 Banking Crisis:** Schwab has faced significant headwinds in 2023 due to the banking crisis and increased regulatory scrutiny of its handling of client cash.  These factors have contributed to a decline in its stock price and profitability.
> During our March 2023 earnings call, CEO Walt Bettinger said, “We certainly don't underestimate the client transition of moving cash away from Schwab into some other alternative.” 

* **Uncertain Future:**  The future for Schwab is unusually uncertain, even by Wall Street standards. The current macroeconomic environment, coupled with industry-specific challenges, makes projecting financials a highly speculative exercise. Given the lack of available information, and the very high volatility of the stock market, it makes sense to value the company by calculating the present value of near-term (1 to 5 years) and longer-term (10 years or more) cash flows, rather than assigning a value to the company based on an enterprise multiple.  An annual FCF analysis is therefore needed.

This pessimistic and skeptical valuation reflects the uncertainty surrounding Schwab's future.  It is possible that the company could perform better than we have projected, but we believe that a cautious approach is warranted given the challenges it faces.
