{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Fairfax's moat receives a rating of 2 out of 5. This moderate rating is justified by the following:

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Fairfax has built a brand associated with long-term value investing and a contrarian approach. While this brand recognition exists within the financial community, it's not as powerful as a consumer brand, limiting its pricing power. As Damodaran explains in *The Little Book of Valuation*, brand names provide a moat when consumers are willing to pay more for a product solely because of the name. Fairfax's focus on institutional clients limits this effect.
* **Investment Strategy:**  Fairfax's investment strategy, led by Prem Watsa, creates a differentiated approach to insurance. Their long-term value investing philosophy and willingness to take contrarian bets may provide an edge. However, investment returns can be volatile, and its long-term success is not guaranteed.  As Dorsey emphasizes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, a company's competitive advantage must be *durable* to constitute a true moat. Fairfax's investment approach, while differentiated, doesn't offer the same structural protection as other moat sources like high switching costs or network effects.

**Management:**

Fairfax's management receives a rating of 3 out of 5. This rating is justified by considering the following:

* **Leadership:** Prem Watsa, the Chairman and CEO, has extensive experience and a strong track record. He is considered a value investing guru in some circles.  However, like any individual investor, he is not immune to mistakes (e.g. recent struggles with some energy investments, as acknowledged in the Q2 2018 earnings call), and as mentioned in *The Little Book of Valuation*, all human judgment is inherently flawed and biased.
* **Long-Term Focus:**  Management's long-term focus is a positive, aligning with their value investing philosophy. However,  their long-term performance has been uneven.
* **Communication:** Management communication is generally candid and transparent, but could benefit from providing more granular data on its various businesses and segments, following the advice presented in McKinsey's *Valuation*.  
* **Capital Allocation:** Fairfax's capital allocation has been mixed. While their long-term investment portfolio has delivered significant returns in the past, recent underperformance raises some questions. Their acquisition record is also mixed. There have been some misses, which, as pointed out in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, is a risk in all acquisitions.
* **Compensation:** Management compensation is tied to book value growth, which incentivizes maximizing intrinsic value, but it has not translated into consistent market value outperformance in recent years. Additionally, significant executive compensation from stock options could incentivize value-reducing share repurchases, a concern raised in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Insider Ownership:**  High insider ownership is generally viewed as positive alignment of interests with shareholders. However, it is worth noting that at Fairfax, a very high proportion of shares are owned by Prem Watsa and related parties, potentially giving him outsized influence.

**Catalyst:**

Fairfax's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.

* **Improving Investment Returns:** A reversion to the mean in their investment portfolio could serve as a catalyst. Given the market correction in 2022, new opportunities may present themselves.  However, as emphasized by Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*, market timing is impossible, and it's not certain when (or if) their investment performance will improve.
* **Acquisitions:** Fairfax is always on the lookout for acquisitions, particularly in troubled times. This could provide a catalyst if they can successfully integrate and manage acquisitions, turning around performance. However, there is no guarantee of finding accretive acquisitions. As pointed out in McKinsey's *Valuation*, due diligence is crucial.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:**  Fairfax's insurance and reinsurance operations span multiple geographic regions and business lines.  Their revenue stream is therefore diversified, buffering them from some cyclical risks.  Revenues are growing, but growth is expected to slow in mature markets like North America.
* **Margins:** Margins can be volatile, reflecting the inherent cyclical nature of insurance. They benefit from economies of scale in some segments, which can lead to enhanced margins.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The insurance industry is highly competitive, with many large, well-established players. Fairfax's differentiated strategy and focus on long-term value investing helps them stand out.  However, this industry has relatively low barriers to entry.
* **Trends:**  The insurance industry is evolving rapidly, with consolidation, digitization, and the rise of insurtech. Fairfax's long-term focus and technology investments position them well to adapt.


**Financials:**

Fairfax's financial performance has been mixed. Revenues and book value have been growing, but profitability has been less consistent.  Financial leverage is moderate, and liquidity is strong.  A review of Fairfax's 2015–2019 financial statements reveals:

{: .note }
* **Revenue Growth:**  Fairfax had strong organic revenue growth, averaging 12.5 percent per year. However, it is important to separate the organic revenue growth from revenue growth acquired from other companies, as revenue growth through acquisition does not add intrinsic value.
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** Fairfax had a average ROE, with a median of approximately 12.4 percent.
{: .important }
* **Profitability:** Fairfax’s overall profitability has been inconsistent over this period, with returns on invested capital significantly below their cost of capital for several years.


**Valuation:**

A **discounted cash flow (DCF)** valuation was performed using Fairfax’s consolidated 2018 financials.

**Assumptions:**

* **Forecast Period:** 5 years (2019–2023)
* **Revenue Growth:** 5% annually (pessimistic assumption, considering growth is expected to slow in mature markets)
* **Operating Margin:** 10% (in line with 2018 adjusted margin)
* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** 1.0 (in line with recent history)
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (consistent with current effective tax rate)
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  9% (derived using a risk-free rate of 3%, an equity risk premium of 5%, a beta of 0.9, and a cost of debt of 6%)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:**  3% (consistent with long-run inflation)

**Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | Reinvestment | FCF | PV of FCF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2019 | $16.262B | $1.626B | $0.163B | $1.463B | $1.337B |
| 2020 | $17.075B | $1.708B | $0.171B | $1.537B | $1.280B |
| 2021 | $17.929B | $1.793B | $0.179B | $1.614B | $1.226B |
| 2022 | $18.831B | $1.883B | $0.188B | $1.695B | $1.175B |
| 2023 | $19.772B | $1.977B | $0.198B | $1.779B | $1.127B |
| Terminal Value (2024) |  |  |  | $31.255B | $21.108B |

**Terminal Value Calculation:**
```
TV = (1.977B * (1 + 0.03) * (1 - (0.03 / 0.12)) / (0.09 - 0.03) = $31.255 billion
```

**Present Value of Firm:**  $27.253 billion (sum of PV of FCFs and PV of Terminal Value)

**Value of Equity:**  $17.23 billion

The value per share was calculated by dividing the value of equity by the number of shares outstanding (425 million).

**Value per Share:**  $40.54

It is worth noting that this is just one possible valuation, and the actual value could be higher or lower depending on your assumptions about growth, profitability, and risk.
