{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

L3Harris benefits from some degree of moat stemming primarily from **high switching costs** and **intangible assets** (patents, government licenses). These advantages are not trivial but they are not as strong and sustainable as those enjoyed by the very best companies. 

* **Switching Costs:** LHX serves government and commercial customers with complex and integrated solutions. Switching to a competitor would be complex and costly for these customers. 
* **Intangible Assets:** The company possesses a significant portfolio of patents and is subject to government regulation in many of its business lines.  This serves as a barrier to entry for potential competitors. However, legal challenges to patents are a risk, and technological advancements can render patents obsolete relatively quickly. Further, governmental favor can be fleeting and subject to change based on political whims.

{: .warning }

LHX operates in a highly competitive landscape.  While it possesses a narrow moat, it's crucial to acknowledge the continual threat of disruption from technological advancements and changing government priorities. This risk is the primary rationale for assigning a modest moat rating.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

LHX management demonstrates a mixed record.  

* **Capital Allocation:**  The company has engaged in both acquisitions and divestitures, with varying degrees of success.  The recent divestiture of its commercial aviation business, while improving operating margins, also resulted in a smaller revenue base.
* **Communication:**  The company provides segment information, including customer-related and contract-related revenue breakdowns, which can help investors gauge the company's exposure and potential growth opportunities, even in government-related business. The company's quarterly and annual reports provide details about its acquisitions, divestitures, and other financial adjustments. However, while the company does discuss its overall strategy, there appears to be a lack of in-depth discussion about long-term value drivers, which is concerning, especially for intrinsic investors.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is aligned with financial performance, with incentives weighted based on company performance as well as stock-price appreciation. Although this seems like an incentive to deliver shareholder value, it also incentivizes short-term behavior over long-term value creation.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is not particularly high.

{: .important }

While management has delivered decent returns on capital in recent years,  the company's heavy reliance on acquisitions raises questions about the sustainability of organic growth.  The management team's focus seems more oriented toward boosting short-term earnings than long-term value, as shown by the continued pursuit of acquisitions. Their annual and quarterly disclosures do not reveal the strategic reasoning behind most of their acquisitions, and it's unclear whether any of these acquisitions were based upon a rigorous DCF analysis.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

LHX has a few potential catalysts for share-price appreciation:

* **Increased defense spending:**  Geopolitical instability can lead to increased demand for LHX's products and services, boosting revenue growth and margins. L3Harris' CEO emphasized this point in the Q2 2023 earnings call, mentioning increased defense spending in Europe in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
* **Successful integration of acquisitions:**  Successful integration and realization of synergies from acquisitions can lead to improved profitability. The company's recent acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, while pending regulatory approval, could unlock tremendous long-term value, but there are doubts among investors about its completion.
* **Expansion into new markets:** L3Harris is expanding its presence in faster-growing international markets, which could contribute to revenue growth.  The company is now in the process of integrating Aerojet Rocketdyne's infrastructure to support increased demand for its products and services and to accelerate penetration in the space and missile defense market. However, the company's recent experiences in some of these markets has been mixed. 

{: .note }

While these catalysts have the potential to drive share-price appreciation, they are also subject to significant uncertainty. The company's dependence on government spending makes it susceptible to political and budgetary risks. The integration of acquisitions can also be fraught with challenges. Expansion into new markets can be costly and time-consuming, with no guarantee of success.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues:** LHX derives a significant portion of its revenue (almost 60% in FY 2023) from U.S. government contracts. The remaining revenue is mostly from commercial and international customers. The company provides a diversified product portfolio. This diversification, however, stems from acquisitions, rather than internal development of new product categories.
* **Trends:** The defense industry is currently experiencing growth in areas such as space, electronic warfare, and cyber security.  However, the company faces increasing competition in some of its core businesses. The main growth drivers in this sector, from the company's perspective, are product improvement and product launch.
* **Margins:** L3Harris generally enjoys robust operating margins, thanks to the mission-critical nature of its products and services, which allows for a modest degree of price flexibility.

**Financial Overview:**

L3Harris has demonstrated strong financial performance in recent years, with consistent revenue growth, driven by acquisitions as well as organic growth, and healthy profit margins.  However, the company's dependence on government spending makes it susceptible to budgetary cuts. Further, its aggressive acquisition strategy has led to a high level of debt, which could pose a risk to its financial stability. 

**Valuation ($37.6 Billion):**

A **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** analysis was employed to arrive at the company's fair value.  A 10-year explicit forecast period was used, followed by a terminal value calculation.  Several valuation scenarios were considered, including a business-as-usual scenario, a positive revenue and margins scenario, and a negative revenue and margins scenario. These scenarios are described in greater detail in the [Morgan Stanley report](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/en-us/institutional-investor/insights/articles/assessing-the-moat.html).

**Key Valuation Assumptions and Calculations (Business-as-Usual Scenario):**

{: .note }

These assumptions and calculations are for demonstration purposes. Your judgment and calculations should be substituted.


* **Revenue Growth:**  2% for the next five years (in line with the long-run historical average of real U.S. GDP growth), declining to 1% in perpetuity (terminal growth). This reflects the expectation that long-term growth will be subdued due to continued industry consolidation.
* **Operating Margin:** 21% (in line with LHX's historical average). We assume a slight margin improvement.
* **Tax Rate:** 25%
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Estimated based on historical data from 1963 to 2023, the median reinvestment rate for the industry varies significantly over time, but it fluctuates around 40 percent for a firm that is both financially healthy and investing heavily in its business. We maintain an average reinvestment rate around 40 percent.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 7.56% (based on a risk-free rate of 3.2%, market risk premium of 4.5%, an unlevered beta of 0.8, a pre-tax cost of debt of 4.7%, and a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity)
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the perpetuity growth method. Note that, in the long run, WACC should approximate the nominal growth rate of the economy, given that the stock market is a leading indicator for the health of the U.S. economy. 
* **Probability of Failure:**  1%, reflecting a relatively stable company operating in a mature industry. 
* **Liquidation Value:** Estimated to be around one-third of the intrinsic valuation, a common ratio during financial hardship.
* **Other Assumptions:** We are assuming a growth rate in perpetuity of 1.0%, which reflects our pessimism toward the overall growth of the U.S. economy, especially after the recent economic slowdown. The risk-free rate is in line with the yield on 10-year government zero-coupon bonds. The market risk premium used in this analysis is in line with historical observations. 


**Valuation Calculations (Business-as-Usual Scenario):**


| Item                           | Value (Billions) |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Present Value of Cash Flows        | $34.9                |
| Terminal Value                    | $5.4               |
| Nonoperating Assets               | $3.4                |
| Total Enterprise Value (EV)        | $43.7              |
| Debt and other financial claims | $6.1                |
| Value of Equity                  | $37.6                |

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  Like many other companies, L3Harris has been affected by supply chain disruptions in recent years, particularly during and after the COVID pandemic.  These disruptions, discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call, have led to increased costs and delays in some product lines. Management believes that these disruptions are a short-term phenomenon, and they have already begun to ease, but it is too early to make any concrete predictions about the near future. Management expressed optimism about improvements in the supply chain and raw material costs in the Q1 2024 earnings call.
* **Inflation:** Higher inflation has increased the cost of labor and materials, impacting margins. The management team is implementing cost-cutting measures and price increases to mitigate the impact of inflation.
* **Labor Shortages:** There are ongoing concerns about securing quality personnel in highly competitive engineering and technical fields. Management continues to implement actions to attract, engage, and retain employees, but there are no guarantees that these actions will succeed.

L3Harris faces a complex and challenging business environment.  Its dependence on government spending makes it vulnerable to political and budgetary risks.  While the company has demonstrated strong financial performance in recent years, its reliance on acquisitions raises questions about the sustainability of organic growth. Despite these challenges, L3Harris's narrow moat, stemming from switching costs and patents, gives it some degree of pricing power and protection from competition.  However, the company's valuation is not particularly compelling given the uncertainties it faces and the management's focus on acquisitions and short-term earnings.  A more pessimistic investor might assign a lower valuation given the company's substantial dependence on government contracts, the risks posed by its high debt, and the uncertainty surrounding future industry growth.
