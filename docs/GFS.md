GlobalFoundries (GFS) operates in the semiconductor industry, specifically in the foundry segment. Foundries manufacture chips for companies that design them but do not have their own fabrication facilities. This business model shields GFS from significant portions of the massive capital expenditures associated with semiconductor fabrication, giving it an advantage. However, competition in the foundry space, especially from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), remains fierce.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

GFS's moat rating of 2/5 is based on several factors.

* **Narrow Moat:**  While GFS does benefit from offering a differentiated service of manufacturing chips for fabless semiconductor firms, it lacks the scale and technological edge of TSMC.  This limits its pricing power and makes its moat relatively narrow. It does not have the unique resources, cost advantage or brand name that would create a wider moat.  The moat rating is derived from the framework in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth* by Pat Dorsey and also using frameworks from Competitive Strategy by Michael Porter.
* **Intangible Assets:** GFS attempts to build a strong brand name and develop differentiated scalable products. However, customer switching costs are not extremely high, and these intangible assets are unlikely to protect them against a sustained, well-financed competitor from entering their industry.
* **Switching Costs:** GFS has long-term agreements with some customers, but given the high rate of technological change in the industry and the company's reliance on existing technology, switching costs are not sufficient to be considered a major source of moat, as is the case for companies like Adobe or Intuit. 

**Management:**

GFS's management rating of 3/5 is based on several factors.

* **Experience and Track Record:** The current management team is relatively new, with CEO Thomas Caulfield taking the reins in 2018. While Caulfield has extensive experience in the semiconductor industry (including leadership positions at IBM and Mubadala), GFS's financial performance has been mixed since his appointment.  This mixed record warrants some skepticism, as a stable management team with a proven track record of success would merit a higher rating, especially given the company's relatively short public company history.  This rating is derived from the arguments in *The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham where he focuses on management quality.  Also, considering the principles discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, where Buffett places a significant emphasis on management's track record over many years as a better indicator of managerial quality.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  GFS has made some acquisitions, such as that of ARM Holdings, but has not demonstrated exceptional capital allocation skills, and relative to its size, it has invested more in its own stock than in its core business. As per the criteria for acquisitions in the *McKinsey Valuation* book, most acquisitions do not create value, therefore this does not add to the rating of the management.  GFS has made some cost cutting decisions in 2023, but the rationale provided for cost cutting decisions like that by CEO Caulfield in Q1 2023 Earnings Call is not entirely persuasive, thus not boosting the rating of the management.
* **Communication and Transparency:** GFS's communication has been relatively transparent and thorough, but as seen in Q1 2023 and Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcripts, their explanations for some of their business and strategic decisions are not entirely persuasive, such as the pricing decisions in 2023 and their rationale for cost cutting. More convincing and insightful communication would merit a higher rating. This assessment draws inspiration from Michael Burry's thorough and often skeptical evaluations of companies, which goes beyond simply accepting management's claims at face value.
* **Compensation:** There has not been any controversy regarding executive pay. Executive pay is largely tied to earnings and share price. While this structure can be incentive-compatible, its impact on maximizing long-term value is not clear.


**Catalyst:**

GFS's catalyst rating of 3/5 is based on the following considerations:

* **Increasing Demand for Semiconductor Chips:** The long-term growth in the semiconductor industry, driven by increasing demand for chips across a variety of sectors (including automotive, mobile, and high-performance computing), could provide a catalyst for GFS's growth.  As noted in Q1 2023 Earnings Call, the long-term growth in semi conductors industry could provide a sustained catalyst for GFS as well.
* **Supply Chain Diversification:**  Concerns about geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions have led to calls for greater diversification of semiconductor manufacturing, potentially benefiting GFS. GFS management team has often mentioned this as a catalyst for the company.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The competitive landscape remains intense. TSMC is still the dominant player in the foundry space, and other competitors are also investing heavily in capacity expansion and technology improvements. This could limit GFS's growth potential. This is based on industry and competitive landscape analysis explained in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*.
* **Management’s statements:** Management has mentioned in Q2 2023 earnings call that they are going to focus on more growth, particularly the type of growth that would allow them to get the benefits of existing underutilized capacity. The challenge will be convincing investors that GFS can increase its revenues and profits without sacrificing margins.

**Valuation:**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with moderately pessimistic assumptions, I arrive at a fair value of $22.8 billion for GFS.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth is projected to slow from 10 percent in the first few years (in line with expected sales increase as announced in the Q2 2023 earnings call) to 3 percent in perpetuity (in line with long-run nominal global GDP growth rate). This is justified because most products follow a natural life cycle and given the competitive landscape, it is not sustainable for high growth rates to persist.  Moreover, as described in McKinsey’s Valuation, for most product markets, sustaining high revenue growth is very difficult. 
* **Operating Margin:** Operating margin is projected to remain flat at 25 percent. This seems like a reasonable level given their current performance and industry dynamics. This is justified based on the concept discussed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies* where it mentions that the company should focus on improving operating performance as its key strategic objective.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Reinvestment rate is projected to decline from 70 percent in the first five years to 25 percent in perpetuity. This is justified because as the company matures, its reinvestment needs should decline. As mentioned in *The Little Book of Valuation*, reinvestment is important to deliver growth.  However, reinvestment needs will decline as the company matures.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Based on our analysis, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated to be around 8.5 percent. We start with the risk-free rate of approximately 3.75 percent (10-year U.S. Government Bond rate in July 2023). Based on recent returns, and a beta of around 1.0, I estimate an equity risk premium of approximately 4.5 percent, thus assuming that the expected return on equity will be approximately 8.25%.  Although there is disagreement about appropriate parameters for equity risk premium, I prefer a more conservative approach since overconfidence is the worst enemy of an investor. The firm's after-tax cost of debt is estimated to be 4.27 percent based on its May 2023 rating of Ba1 (Moody's) and interest rate of 5.56%.  This cost of debt is then probability weighted based on the Ba1 bond rating.  Finally the overall cost of capital for the entire enterprise is based on the current market value weights of equity (85%) and debt (15%).


**Valuation Calculations:**


{: .highlight }

The company’s entire value comes from its after-tax operating income. Value Inc’s and Volume Inc’s enterprise values are equal. If we discount each cash flow separately, we arrive at the same value obtained earlier using enterprise DCF. Based on the same projections of performance, the company’s intrinsic value remains the same regardless of the valuation method. This is justified based on the arguments in McKinsey's *Valuation* and *The Little Book of Valuation* by Aswath Damodaran, which illustrates the fundamental idea that enterprise value is the sum of the value of operations and non-operating assets, after adjusting for debt and other non-equity claims.

The equity value is estimated based on the DCF methodology outlined in *The Little Book of Valuation*. Given growth rates, margins, reinvestment and cost of capital assumptions, free cash flow can be projected. The continuing value can then be calculated using the same assumptions. Finally, the free cash flows and continuing value are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to reflect the impact of financial leverage (using the adjusted present value approach), which results in the equity value.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

GFS has faced some headwinds in recent quarters, including a decline in revenue growth and margin compression in the semiconductor industry, partly due to a global slowdown. The company has also undertaken significant cost-cutting measures in 2023, causing some investors to be concerned about its long-term prospects, this is mentioned in Q1 2023 and Q2 2023 earnings call transcripts, but management maintains that they are well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth in the semiconductor industry. These cost-cutting measures were explained by CFO Dave Reeder in the Q1 2023 Earnings Call: "But the reality is, as part of our commitment to improving our profitability, we have started taking actions already, and we are going to continue to take actions throughout the year, which we will see the benefits of in the second half."

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **New Product Launches:** GFS is investing heavily in new technologies and product development, which could drive future growth. As discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call, GFS expects to launch new products in the near future. These new product launches could potentially increase revenues and market share significantly.  
* **Acquisitions:** GFS has made some acquisitions in the past.  Further acquisitions could accelerate growth, as mentioned in Q2 2023 earnings call transcript. However, the track record of acquisitions creating value in the semiconductor industry is mixed, and GFS would need to demonstrate significant strategic synergies to justify the premium paid for any future acquisitions, as argued in the *McKinsey Valuation* book.
* **Cost Cutting and Margin Improvement:** GFS has implemented cost-cutting measures in 2023.  If these measures prove successful in improving the company's profitability, it could lead to a re-rating of the stock. However, as per the framework in *The Little Book of Valuation*, success in valuation often comes from assessing not just whether management’s cost cutting claims are correct, but whether they are likely to have a material impact. Given that GFS has to do so much cost cutting suggests that the industry is far too competitive for investors to comfortably assume stable margins. 
* **New and improved technologies and products:** GFS is making investments in Silicon Photonics, FinFET-based products, and RF SOI solutions. New and improved products will be important to the future financial health of the company.

I would like to highlight that even if all of these catalysts materialize, it's important to note that GFS still faces significant competition from TSMC, and its success is not guaranteed.
