{: .note }
PGE is one of the oldest public utility companies in the United States. It is heavily regulated and is subject to Federal, State, and local laws.

### Business Overview

{: .highlight }
PGE operates as a vertically-integrated utility, owning and operating generation facilities, including hydroelectric, natural gas, coal, and wind power plants. They also purchase power from other utilities.

*   **Revenues:** PGE's revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electricity to retail customers in its service area in Oregon. These customers are divided into residential, commercial, and industrial classifications. In addition, the company participates in the wholesale market by purchasing and selling power with other utilities.
     *    Retail sales provide the vast majority of their revenue with around 60% to 70%.
     *  Wholesale sales are another important source of revenue with around 30 to 40%.
*   **Industry Trends:** The utility industry is undergoing significant changes, driven by the need to decarbonize the energy sector and integrate renewable energy sources. The industry is also facing challenges related to grid modernization and the need for smart and adaptive technologies, which also requires enormous amounts of capital.  This leads to many players merging, changing their business models, and even exiting the industry.
*   **Margins:** PGE's operating margins are influenced by various factors, including the price of fuel, operational expenses, and regulatory decisions. Margins can fluctuate based on the variability of prices for gas and other raw materials.
*   **Competitive Landscape:**  PGE operates in a regulated market, meaning it has a government granted monopoly within its service area. However, it does have to engage with its competitors as a result of certain regulatory mandates and market forces.
    *   **Barriers to entry** are high, due to large upfront capital expenditure and regulatory requirements, which results in a somewhat stable competitive landscape.
    *    Large amount of focus on public image, compliance, and employee safety which creates opportunities for differentiation.
    *   They face competition from private and cooperative utilities and some competition in the wholesale electricity market. They often have a first right of refusal on customers in their area.
     *   PGE is affected by the cost of natural gas, coal, and other energy sources in the wholesale market.
    *   They face regulatory uncertainty, especially surrounding prices, rates, and the amount they can charge to customers.
*  **Differentiators:**
     *    PGE is a vertically integrated utility that operates in a single, reasonably stable jurisdiction, Oregon, which makes their long-term returns much more predictable.
     *   PGE is a publicly traded company with multiple ownership structures, which results in higher investor trust.
     *    PGE has emphasized its commitment to renewable energy, developing new technologies, and improving grid reliability.

### Financial Analysis

{: .important }
Recent events have had a significant impact on the company’s financial results, including higher power prices, large operating costs, and lower customer demand due to weather conditions.

*   **Revenues:** PGE's revenues increased significantly in 2022 and 2023, primarily due to higher electricity prices and volumes. However, in 2024 this trend has reversed, with revenues decreasing, in part due to warmer weather conditions.
*   **Operating Expenses:** Operating expenses have increased at a slightly higher rate, reflecting the increased cost of energy, materials, and other operating costs.
*   **Net Income:** Net income had increased at times, but overall, it has become very volatile.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** PGE’s ROIC has generally hovered around 8 percent recently, but as we’ve noticed, their management reports the economic ROIC to be much higher. However, this depends on regulatory rulings and what is counted as "investment." A recent earnings call indicated that they are having trouble generating ROIC at above 10 percent.
*  **Capital Structure**: The Company’s management team targets a long term debt-to-equity ratio of 50/50, which they believe to be the most efficient for its shareholder base. Their cost of capital is approximately 8%, comprised of 5% cost of debt, and 10% cost of equity, though this can vary widely depending on the economic environment.
*  **Debt**: PGE has had some issues with long-term debt, which they are managing by paying it down and trying to be more efficient in their capital expenditures.
*   **Cash flow**: PGE's cash flows are directly influenced by the volatility of power prices. With rising prices, they have seen an increase in free cash flow. However, with lower prices or lower demand, the free cash flow tends to reduce.

{: .note }
In the most recent earnings call, it was revealed that they have been unable to meet the minimum ROE levels, set by the regulators. This can significantly harm their profitability.

### Moat Rating: 2/5

PGE has a very narrow moat. It is a heavily regulated, vertically integrated utility, which has some elements of network effect. However, they face a lot of challenges related to competition and a high chance of being disrupted or bypassed.

*   **Narrow moat due to the regulated nature of the business:** PGE is essentially granted a regional monopoly, providing some protection against direct competition, which helps them maintain a higher profitability, that is more stable over time. However, this also limits their pricing power. This creates a small moat, but also makes them extremely sensitive to regulatory changes.
*   **The cost of switching is high:** Due to the nature of infrastructure, high switching costs tend to protect incumbent utilities.
*   **Lack of brand moat:** Although some people are loyal to their utility brand, there isn't much difference between utilities from the consumer viewpoint.

### Moat Risks

PGE faces many challenges to their ability to maintain sustainable long-term profits, which are eroding their moat.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** PGE is subject to complex regulatory oversight by the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) and federal authorities. Changes in regulations can significantly impact PGE's profitability.
*   **Competition from other sources**: PGE faces competition from alternate energy providers, such as solar panels and microgrids, as well as new energy technologies and batteries. This will directly compete with their transmission and delivery systems.
*   **High capital expenditure:** PGE's continuous maintenance, upgrading, and expanding of transmission and delivery networks often requires substantial investment and capital expenditures. This will make a company much more sensitive to interest rate rises.
*   **Technological Disruptions:** Changes in technology regarding green energy, battery storages, and smart metering can result in the company falling behind its competitors.
*  **Commodity Price Risk**: As a primary electricity generator, PGE is susceptible to swings in natural gas and coal prices, which could materially affect its profitability, and its ability to pay debts.

### Business Resilience

PGE has demonstrated some level of resilience over the years, with long-term contracts, price mechanisms, and a monopoly position. However, due to the inherent uncertainty in the industry and the rising competition, especially from green energy sources and community providers, its resilience is declining.

*   **Revenue Stability:** As a primarily regulated business, they have a stable stream of revenues for the most part. Their contracts with customers provide them some degree of pricing protection, limiting major decreases. However, this is also a limited strength.
*  **Demand Stability:** Due to the essential nature of electricity, the demand of their product will probably remain stable, even in times of recession.
*   **Customer Loyalty:** Due to the nature of the utility market, their customers are unlikely to switch, as the alternatives are often few and far between.
*   **Asset Strength**: PGE maintains a very stable asset base with significant long-term investments into power generation facilities and transmission lines.

### Understandability: 2/5

Due to the high level of regulation and the specialized language used in the energy industry, PGE can be hard to understand.
*  Understanding and quantifying their ROIC is difficult, due to some of the regulatory accounting nuances.
*  Understanding the impact of changes in legislation can be difficult to understand, because of how they change prices.
* Understanding how their business operations create value is not straightforward.

### Balance Sheet Health: 3/5

Although they are a utility company with generally strong asset, their liabilities are very large, and their debt ratios are a cause for concern.

*   **Debt:** PGE has significant long-term debt outstanding, which, if not managed correctly, could increase their sensitivity to rising interest rates.
*  **Cash Flow**: Their cash flows are generally good, but may face risk due to swings in natural gas prices.

### Conclusion

PGE is a utility company that has a limited moat and, as a result, is unlikely to produce significant growth, making them an average investment. They are currently dealing with a lot of issues related to economic environments, making the company's ability to generate positive ROIC, or provide a good value proposition for long-term investors questionable. Their complex regulatory landscape adds an additional layer of uncertainty. This requires close monitoring by their management and investors.
