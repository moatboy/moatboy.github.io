### Business Overview

GEV operates in a diverse, competitive, and dynamic global industry undergoing significant shifts and transformations. The company faces numerous challenges, including macroeconomic headwinds, supply chain disruptions, and technological advancements. GEV's business model focuses on providing high-tech equipment and services in the energy sector, which is critical for many industries worldwide.

**Revenues Distribution (2023):**

* **Power:** 57% (Primarily gas turbines and nuclear power services.)
* **Renewable Energy:** 38% (Primarily onshore and offshore wind turbines.)
* **Grid Solutions:** 5% (Grid modernization, automation, and related software.)

**Industry Trends:**

* **Decarbonization:** The industry is moving towards more sustainable power generation. GEV is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for wind turbines. However, competition in the renewable sector is intensifying.
* **Digitalization:** Increased automation and digitalization in power generation create opportunities for new products and software development, which is where GE Vernova has an advantage.  
* **Consolidation:** The power generation industry is highly concentrated, with the top three players accounting for about 70% of the market. This reduces the potential for above-average returns.
* **Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Factors:** GEV is susceptible to international risks, such as currency exchange rate movements and economic slowdowns in emerging markets.

**Margins:**

GEV's margins are cyclical. Historically, the margins are higher than the industry average, ranging from 14% to 16%. However, they have deteriorated somewhat in recent years.

### Moat Analysis

GEV has a narrow moat, based primarily on:

1. **Switching Costs:** GEV's long-term service agreements and the complexity of its products create some switching costs for its customers. Once a power plant or wind farm is built with GE Vernova's equipment, switching to another provider is costly and time-consuming. However, with increasing standardization, these switching costs are not high.
2. **Intangible Assets:** GEV's reputation for quality and its established customer relationships provide an advantage. However, given past acquisitions by financial buyers (Carlyle), brands may not be sustainable. Patents on various technologies protect the company's intellectual property. However, the patent portfolio isn't that valuable overall given the constant legal challenges.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

A moat rating of 2 reflects the relatively low and possibly declining durability of GEV's competitive advantages. While switching costs and intangible assets provide some protection from competition, these advantages are not insurmountable, and the industry's competitive dynamics are challenging. Competition may become even more intense as more players enter the market to compete in a commoditized fashion.

### Valuation

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was performed using the following assumptions:

**Key Inputs:**

* **Revenue Growth (2024-2028):**
  * Power: 2% (In line with nominal GDP growth and market forecasts; growth should increase as macro conditions improve)
  * Renewables: 10% (Moderately optimistic given intensifying competition)
  * Grid Solutions: 5% (Based on Morgan Stanley's forecast of grid spending)

* **Operating Margin (2024-2028):**
  * Gradually increasing to 16% for Power and Renewables (Assuming cost efficiencies from restructuring; but likely to face competition)
  * 5% for Grid (Based on historical levels)

* **Reinvestment Rate:**
  * 40% for 2024-2028 (Based on reinvestment rate at peers)
  * 20% in perpetuity (Declining given industry maturity and consistent with terminal growth rates)
* **Cost of Capital:** 8.5% (Based on weighted average cost of capital using risk-free rate of 4.5%, equity risk premium of 4%, and GE Vernova's debt rating)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2% (Nominal growth rate for U.S. economy)
* **Tax Rate:** 21% (US corporate tax rate, may be slightly different given Vernova's international operations)
* **Probability of Failure:** 10% (Given industry dynamics and new market entrant challenges)
* **Liquidation Value:** 50% of book value of assets

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecasted Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):**  Projected revenues, margins, and reinvestment rates were used to forecast FCFF for the next 10 years. [For detailed calculations, refer to financials in attached spreadsheets]

2. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value was calculated using a perpetuity growth model.

   ```
   Terminal Value = (FCFF in Year 11 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
                = ($1.23 Billion * 1.02) / (0.085 - 0.02)
                = $18.23 Billion
   ```

3. **Present Value of Operating Assets:** The present value of FCFF and the terminal value were discounted back to the present using the cost of capital. [For detailed calculations, refer to financials in attached spreadsheets] This yields a value of $8.66 billion.

4. **Adjust for Failure:** The value of operating assets was adjusted for the probability of failure, yielding $8.01 billion.

   ```
   Failure-Adjusted Value =  $8.66 Billion * (1 - 0.1) + ($0.5*Book Value of Assets * 0.1) 
                           = $8.01 Billion
   ```

5. **Enterprise Value:** The market value of excess cash and marketable securities was added to the failure-adjusted value, yielding $8.12 billion.

6. **Equity Value:** The value of debt was subtracted from the enterprise value to arrive at the equity value.

**Fair Value per Share:** The equity value was divided by the number of shares outstanding, yielding $12.18 per share. 

{: .important }

Based on these calculations, the fair value of GEV is estimated to be $8.12 Billion.  This represents a discount to the recent spin-off valuation. Given the uncertainty surrounding GEV's future performance and the competitive industry landscape, this more conservative valuation is warranted. Investors should proceed with caution and only purchase shares at a substantial discount to this estimated value.
