## CLM (Clarivate Analytics) | Moat: 2 / 5 | Understandability: 4 / 5 | Balance Sheet Health: 2 / 5

Clarivate Analytics is a global information services and analytics company that provides structured information and analytics to professionals and organizations, mostly in the areas of scientific and academic research, intellectual property, and life sciences.

### Business Overview

{: .highlight } Clarivate provides insights and analytics that help customers accelerate the pace of innovation.
Here is a detailed look at Clarivate's business:

*   **Revenue Distribution:** Clarivateâ€™s revenue streams primarily come from subscriptions to its various databases, analytics tools, and services, which are tailored towards research, academic, government, legal, and corporate institutions.
    *   **Subscription Revenues:** The core of their revenue is based on recurring subscriptions, offering predictability and stability. Key products like Web of Science, Derwent Innovation, and Cortellis generate recurring revenue.
    *   **Professional Services:** Revenue is also derived from consulting and professional services related to IP management, regulatory intelligence, and market access, which often complement their subscription products.

*   **Industry Trends:** The industries in which Clarivate operates are seeing increased demand for data, analytics, and insights.
    *   **Data-Driven Decision Making:** There is a significant shift toward data-driven decision-making across scientific research, intellectual property, and regulatory compliance.
    *   **Focus on Innovation:** The increasing emphasis on innovation across industries boosts the demand for high-quality, structured data and analytics to accelerate research and development.
    *   **Regulatory Pressures:** Heightened regulatory oversight in pharmaceuticals and healthcare, along with increasing IP litigation and patent filings, creates a need for the specialized data and insights that Clarivate provides.

*   **Competitive Landscape:** The information services and analytics market is competitive, comprising a mix of:
    *   **Large Established Players:** These include Elsevier, Thomson Reuters, RELX Group (LexisNexis, etc.), all with established market positions, broad portfolios, and significant resources.
    *   **Specialized Niche Providers:** Offer niche solutions in specific verticals (e.g., pharmaceutical intelligence or IP management).
    *   **In-House Solutions:** Some large corporations and institutions develop internal data and analytics capabilities to reduce dependence on external providers.

*   **What makes Clarivate different:**
{: .important } Clarivate specializes in curating and structuring data in a way that's highly valuable to its specific user segments - researchers, patent professionals, and regulatory experts. Unlike generalist data providers, Clarivate offers domain-specific insights.
Its products are deeply embedded in workflows of key industries, particularly in research, intellectual property, and life sciences. This makes their products hard to replace, even if cheaper alternatives emerge.

*   **Margins:** Clarivate has high gross margins, but substantial operating expenses related to content acquisition, technology development, sales, and marketing weigh on the operating margin. Substantial debt-related expenses (interest) have also weighed on profits.
    *   Recent strategic initiatives (synergies and cost cutting) have helped improve profitability, and that is what they are working on.

### Financial Analysis

{: .important } Understanding the financial health of Clarivate requires scrutinizing its recent performance and key metrics, with emphasis on the most recent reports.
Here's an overview of the latest financials based on available documents and earnings calls:

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   Recent years (2023 and latest reports) indicate that the company aims to achieve long-term sustainable revenue growth. While the organic revenue growth has been a challenge, the company has been taking steps to achieve higher growth.
    *   Organic growth has been a struggle for the company but they are focusing on fixing this. The company expects improvements via revenue synergy capture.
    *   They have improved subscription revenues by focusing on value-added content and analytics solutions.
*   **Profitability:**
    *   Gross margins remain strong, but the operating expenses and high interest costs due to debt burden pressure their operating margins.
    *   Recent efforts aimed at cost management and realizing synergy from acquisitions have improved profitability.
*   **Debt and Leverage:**
    {: .warning }High debt levels remain a concern, although efforts are underway to deleverage through various measures.
    *   Management is focused on paying down debt to decrease their leverage to less than 4x by year end 2024.
*   **Cash Flow:**
    *   Operating cash flow is critical to the company's ability to invest, service debt, and pursue further acquisitions.
    *   Management is implementing strategies to enhance cash flow generation through operating improvements and focusing on recurring revenue.
*   **Guidance:**
{: .new } Management outlook provides insights into expected financial performance but needs careful examination for achievability given historic issues.
    *   FY2024 outlook was provided.
    *   While management projects growth and improved performance, it is vital to assess the realism of these forecasts, considering previous performance issues.

### Moat Analysis (2 / 5)

Clarivate possesses some elements of an economic moat, but it's not as strong or clearly defined as those of some other companies in its space:

*   **Intangible Assets:** Their strong brands (e.g., Web of Science, Derwent Innovation) carry a premium relative to similar products.
*   **Switching Costs:** Substantial switching costs exist because clients embed Clarivate's databases and analytic tools deeply into their workflows. It takes significant time and effort to switch to an alternate database.
*   **Data Assets:** A considerable advantage for Clarivate is its deep, longitudinal datasets. It would take significant investments for competitors to amass similar data.
*   **Scale:** In some segments, they achieve scale advantages, which can make the company profitable.
*   **Weakness:** Given high debt balance and historic mismanagement, the moat strength is hindered.

### Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience

1.  **Disruptive Technologies:** Technological advancements may create opportunities for novel, disruptive solutions, such as AI and more modern platforms, reducing Clarivate's reliance on outdated databases and analyst teams. This could include new analytic methods, crowdsourced data, or AI-driven platforms.
2.  **Increased competition:** The industry is already extremely competitive and the risk of competitors disrupting their position is significant.
3.  **Eroding data:** Competitors can create cheaper databases, or a competitor can start building tools that are very similar to the databases, but use AI to analyze and understand data.
4.  **Market Consolidation:** Consolidations among clients (e.g., mergers among academic institutions) may reduce the number of subscriptions and put pressure on pricing.
5.  **Debt Burden:** High debt levels restrict financial flexibility, preventing Clarivate from quickly investing in growth opportunities and tech improvements.
6. **Inorganic Growth Failure:** Past experience, such as the ProQuest acquisition, has shown the company is not as competent with acquisitions, and future acquisition targets may not add value to the organization.

### Understandability (4 / 5)

{: .note } Clarivate's core business model is relatively straightforward, i.e., gathering data and insights for clients.

Clarivate is easy to understand at a high level. The more technically oriented products and financials, on the other hand, may require a great understanding of the stock market and industry.

### Balance Sheet Health (2 / 5)

{: .warning } Clarivate's balance sheet reveals a concerning level of debt and intangible assets.
1.  **Debt Burden:** The debt is very high. Management is focused on bringing this to less than 4x EBITDA, and the coming time will determine if they are able to successfully achieve this.
2.  **Intangible Assets:** Many assets are goodwill and intangibles from acquisitions. If these intangible assets are not generating commensurate cash flows, that could lead to write-downs and have a direct effect on earnings. The amortized value of their assets is also substantial.

In summary, these factors combine to present an unhealthy balance sheet. It will be important to see the success with deleveraging before judging more favorably.
