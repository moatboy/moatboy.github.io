{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Zoom enjoys a network effect, although a narrower one than initially perceived.  Its user base grew exponentially during the pandemic, increasing the platform's value for both existing and new users.  However, the network effect is weakened by the fact that it operates on an open network (the internet), which allows for easy entry and competition.  Furthermore, switching costs for individual users are relatively low, although they may be higher for businesses that have deeply integrated Zoom into their workflows. This ease of entry and low switching cost for individuals prevents me from giving Zoom a higher moat rating.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Experience and Leadership:** Eric Yuan, Zoom's founder and CEO, has a strong track record in the video communications industry, having previously worked at WebEx.  His vision and leadership were instrumental in Zoom's rapid growth during the pandemic. However, the company's post-pandemic performance raises questions about management's ability to adapt to a changing landscape and navigate intensifying competition.
* **Capital Allocation:** Zoom's capital allocation decisions have been mixed. While the company has historically been prudent with its spending, its acquisition of Five9, which was subsequently abandoned, raises concerns about management's ability to effectively deploy capital for acquisitions.  Furthermore, the company's share repurchases during a period of declining profitability raise questions about the timing of these decisions. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Communication and Transparency:** Zoom's investor relations have generally been good, with the company providing regular updates and guidance.  However, like many tech companies, Zoom often emphasizes "adjusted" financial metrics that can obscure the true underlying performance. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation at Zoom is substantial, raising typical concerns about incentives. Insider ownership is significant but has been declining, which might weaken management's commitment to long-term value creation.  (ZM's Proxy Statement of March 23, 2021)

{: .note }

Overall, management's rating of 3/5 reflects a balance between their past successes and their recent struggles, as well as their substantial, but declining, insider ownership.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Expansion into New Products and Services:** Zoom has been trying to expand its product offerings beyond video conferencing, including Zoom Phone, Zoom Rooms, and Zoom Contact Center.  These new products and services have the potential to expand Zoom's total addressable market and increase revenue growth. (Q1 2024 Earnings Call)
* **International Expansion:** Zoom is also focused on expanding its international presence, which could drive growth in the coming years. However, competition in international markets is intense and success is not guaranteed. (Q1 2024 Earnings Call)
* **Strategic Partnerships:** Zoom has formed strategic partnerships with several large technology companies, including ServiceNow and Dropbox, and there is potential for more joint ventures which could increase access to their customers and increase Zoom's market share. 
* **AI Integration:** Like other technology companies, Zoom is exploring AI integration for features like meeting summaries and real-time translation. These features could enhance the user experience and differentiate Zoom from its competitors. (Q1 2024 Earnings Call)

{: .warning }

While these catalysts offer potential, there is significant uncertainty surrounding their eventual success. The catalyst rating of 3/5 reflects this uncertainty.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** Zoom's revenue primarily comes from subscriptions to its video conferencing platform.  The company has a tiered pricing model, with higher-priced plans offering more features and functionality. Zoom's revenue growth was explosive during the pandemic but has decelerated significantly since then. (ZM's latest 10K)
* **Industry Dynamics:** The video communications industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants and existing players like Microsoft and Google offering similar products. Zoom is facing pressure to differentiate its offerings and maintain its pricing power. (ZM's latest 10K)
* **Margins:** Zoom historically enjoyed high operating margins but they have been declining due to increased competition, lower pricing, and higher expenses, including sales & marketing. (Q1 2024 Earnings Call)
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Zoom competes with several large technology companies, including Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Cisco Webex. Zoom differentiates itself by focusing on ease of use and high-quality video and audio.  However, these features are relatively easy to replicate, and Zoom's competitors have been aggressively adding features and lowering prices.
* **Recent Concern:** Zoom's use of customer data for training its AI models raised privacy concerns and resulted in backlash.  The company issued a revised policy to address these concerns. (Q1 2024 Earnings Call and News Articles)

{: .important }

The company’s reliance on a single core product (video conferencing) and declining margins in the face of intense competition are key risks to its long-term profitability.

**Financials (in-depth):**

Zoom’s financials show a company in transition.  After experiencing phenomenal growth during the pandemic, the company is now facing a period of slower growth and declining profitability.  Key observations include:

* **Decelerating Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth, which peaked at over 300% during the pandemic, has slowed down significantly. (ZM's latest 10K)
* **Declining Margins:**  Gross and operating margins have been declining due to increased competition and higher sales and marketing expenses. (Q1 2024 Earnings Call)
* **Negative Free Cash Flow:** Despite being profitable on an accounting basis, Zoom's free cash flow has become negative. (ZM's latest 10K)
* **Share Repurchases:**  The company has been repurchasing its shares, even during periods of declining profitability. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)

{: .highlight }

These trends underscore the challenges facing Zoom as it tries to navigate a post-pandemic world and compete with larger, well-funded rivals.

**Valuation ($22.84 Billion):**

To value Zoom, a two-stage DCF model was used, drawing heavily from the McKinsey and Damodaran valuation resources provided, which emphasize cash flow and profitability drivers. The model is based on the following key assumptions and calculations:

* **Forecast Period (5 years):** Revenue growth gradually decelerates from 10% in 2024 to 5% in 2028.
* **Operating Margin:**  Gradually improves from 24% in 2024 to 30% in 2028.
* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** Remains constant at 3.0
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Implied by growth and return on capital and is capped at 40%.
* **Stable Growth Period:**  Growth is assumed to be 3%.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Calculated as 8.5%.
* **Marginal tax rate:** Assumed to be 25%.
* **Debt and equity from most recent quarter's 10Q.**


{: .calculation}
These assumptions result in a total enterprise value of $27,376 million. After accounting for nonoperating assets and claims, the value of equity is estimated to be $22,838 million.  Dividing by the number of shares outstanding yields a value per share of $35.22.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Zoom and Five9:** The failed acquisition of Five9, a cloud contact center software provider, raised questions about Zoom's ability to make large, accretive acquisitions. The merger agreement, located in the Five9 DEF 14A, was terminated in October 2021. (Q3 2021 Earnings Call)

{: .note }

These numbers are derived using a pessimistic outlook, factoring in intense competition and declining margins. Given the uncertainty surrounding Zoom's future, a margin of safety is essential. As a further margin of safety, the estimated equity value is adjusted downward by a factor of 0.9, resulting in a final valuation of $22.84 billion. 

It is important to acknowledge that even with a well-structured and thorough DCF analysis like this one, valuations remain uncertain, especially for companies like Zoom that operate in dynamic and competitive industries.
