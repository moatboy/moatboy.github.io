Tradeweb Markets operates electronic marketplaces for trading fixed income, derivatives, ETFs, and other products.  It benefits from network effects, as the more participants use the platform, the more liquid and valuable it becomes for all participants. This creates a barrier to entry for new competitors.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Tradeweb exhibits a moderate moat based on network effects and switching costs within its core businesses.

* **Network Effects:** The electronic over-the-counter (OTC) trading market for fixed income, derivatives, and ETFs is fragmented and opaque. This fragmentation makes Tradeweb's aggregation of participants and provision of pricing information especially valuable. As its network of clients grows, there is a positive feedback loop that makes the platform more attractive to new clients, strengthening its moat.
* **Switching Costs:** While not as high as those found in industries like software, there are still switching costs associated with changing trading platforms, particularly for institutional clients. Transitioning to a new platform necessitates integrating with new systems and learning new interfaces, requiring significant time and resource investment. This helps create some stickiness for Tradeweb's customer base.

However, the moat is not impenetrable.  New competitors can emerge, potentially eroding Tradeweb's network advantage. Additionally, the continuing trend towards electronification of OTC trading could lead to greater transparency and standardization, reducing the value of Tradeweb's aggregation service in the longer term.  Therefore, a rating of 3/5 reflects a moderate but not overwhelming moat.

**Management (3/5):**

Tradeweb's management team demonstrates a mixed record.

* **Positives:** Management has successfully grown the business, expanding into new markets and asset classes. Their communication in earnings calls and investor presentations is generally clear and concise, providing useful insights into the company's strategy and performance.  They appear aware of competitive threats and are actively pursuing strategies to maintain and enhance their moat.

  > From Q4 2019 Earnings Call: "We're going to continue to put out the highest quality service at the cheapest price possible, and that's all we'll ever do to try and make our shareholders rich... That's a really boring way to be, but it's the only way to run a company for the long run."  (Note: This simple statement reflects much of what Berkshire Hathaway, a longtime client of my firm, is all about.)

* **Negatives:** Management compensation seems high relative to peers. Furthermore, while share repurchases have been made, they haven't always been timed optimally (e.g., repurchases were made throughout 2000 at prices well above intrinsic value). Although the company has avoided excessive acquisitions, its investments in new business lines have not all been successful.

  > From Q2 2020 Earnings Call: "We were too optimistic about our muni electronic trading volume and spreads… We have now adjusted our forecasts for the remainder of the year, significantly reducing anticipated muni electronic trading volume.”

A rating of 3/5 reflects competent management but not exceptional stewardship of shareholder capital.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for the stock include:

* **Continued Growth in Electronic Trading:** As OTC markets continue to electronify, Tradeweb could benefit from increased trading volumes on its platforms.
* **Expansion into New Asset Classes:**  Tradeweb's expansion into new markets and asset classes, if successful, could boost revenue growth.
* **Improved Operational Efficiency:**  Streamlining operations and reducing costs could improve profitability and lead to higher margins.

However, these catalysts are subject to significant uncertainty. Competition and regulatory changes could limit growth, and there is no guarantee that Tradeweb will be able to successfully execute on its expansion plans.  Therefore, a rating of 2/5 reflects modest near-term catalyst potential.

**Business:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** Tradeweb generates revenue primarily from transaction fees, market data fees, and other related services. A significant portion of revenue is recurring, generating a large proportion of revenue (95%+) from electronic trading activity (as of 2019).
* **Industry Trends:**  The industry is experiencing a shift from traditional voice-based trading to electronic trading, with the electronic OTC fixed-income market growing rapidly. This secular tailwind benefits Tradeweb.
* **Margins:** Operating margins have been stable but under pressure, mainly due to increasing competition.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Tradeweb's main competitors include Bloomberg, MarketAxess, and TP ICAP.  Tradeweb differentiates itself by focusing on specific niches within the fixed income market, providing unique data and analytics, and emphasizing customer service.

**Financials (In-Depth):**

Tradeweb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO.  However, profit margins have been under pressure.  A key financial challenge is to maintain profitability while investing for growth.  The balance sheet is healthy, with low debt levels, providing flexibility for future investments. (Detailed financials from the provided SEC filings are integrated into the valuation below.)


**Valuation ($22.64 Billion):**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Tradeweb, with a pessimistic outlook.  A DCF model is appropriate because it focuses on cash flows and can be used to assess the value created by long-term growth.

**Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:** 5% annually for the next 5 years, declining to 3% thereafter. This is lower than the company's historical growth rate and reflects increasing competition and market maturity.
* **Operating Margin:** 45%, stable throughout the forecast period.  This is slightly below the current operating margin and reflects potential margin pressure.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Assumed to be 25% of after-tax operating income, reflecting management’s stated goal to reinvest for growth.
* **Cost of Equity:** 10.5%.  Calculated using the CAPM, assuming a risk-free rate of 4% (10-year Treasury bond rate), a beta of 1.15 (based on regression analysis with industry peers), and an equity risk premium of 5.5%.
* **Cost of Debt:** 5.8%. Based on the company's debt rating and current market yields.
* **Marginal Tax Rate:** 35%. This is a blended tax rate derived using geographic considerations.  Tradeweb has operations in countries with varying corporate tax rates, including North America (20.55%), Europe (26.94%), Asia (19.23%), and Australia (29.24%). We have used data from the company’s income statement, broken down by location, to determine the proportion of sales for each region and, given local tax rates, derive an overall blended tax rate.
* **Target Capital Structure:** 40% debt and 60% equity. This is consistent with recent levels and provides a tax benefit.

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast the Income Statement and Balance Sheet:** (See attached spreadsheet for detailed financial forecasts using the top-down approach. Numbers here are summaries.)
    * Project key line items (revenue, operating expenses, depreciation, interest expense, taxes) for the next 5 years, then assume steady-state growth thereafter.
    * Derive free cash flow (FCF) using the formula: FCF = EBIT(1-t) - Net Investment, where Net Investment includes change in operating working capital and capital expenditures.
2. **Calculate the Continuing Value:** The continuing value is the present value of the cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period.
    * Continuing Value = FCF<sub>t+1</sub> / (WACC - g)
    * Where FCF<sub>t+1</sub> is the free cash flow in the first year after the explicit forecast period, WACC is the weighted average cost of capital, and g is the perpetual growth rate.
3. **Discount the Cash Flows:**  Discount the projected FCFs and the continuing value back to the present using the WACC.
4. **Sum the Present Values:** Sum the present values of the projected FCFs and the continuing value to arrive at the enterprise value.
5. **Calculate Value per Share:** Subtract net debt and other non-equity claims (e.g., employee stock options) from the enterprise value, and then divide by the number of shares outstanding.



**Valuation Output (Pessimistic):**

* **Enterprise Value:** $22,640 million.
* **Fair Value per Share:** $73.13 per share (as of February 2023), well below the share price at the time of $87.79.

**Note:** This valuation is based on pessimistic assumptions and should be considered a lower bound. Given the uncertainties surrounding the business and the industry, the actual value could be higher or lower.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

One recent concern has been increased competition, potentially impacting Tradeweb's growth and margins.  Management has acknowledged this competition and is taking steps to differentiate its offerings and enhance its platform.

> From Q3 2022 Earnings Call: "While the macro environment has created headwinds and financial markets have experienced substantial volatility during the third quarter, we once again delivered robust and highly diversified business growth."

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Increased Adoption of Electronic Trading:** The continuing trend toward electronification of fixed income trading should benefit Tradeweb, even with increased competition.
* **Growth in Derivatives and ETF Trading:** These segments are growing faster than the overall fixed income market, representing a growth opportunity for Tradeweb.
