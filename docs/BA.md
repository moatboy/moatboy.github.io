Pessimistic value: $170 B

Boeing is one of the two dominant players in the global duopoly for commercial aircraft manufacturing, alongside Airbus. This industry structure provides a structural competitive advantage. However, Boeing's moat has been weakening for a few reasons:

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


* **Increased competition:** While the duopoly reduces competition significantly, Boeing faces increasingly fierce competition from smaller manufacturers in specific segments (e.g., Embraer in regional jets) and from Chinese manufacturers over the long term.
* **Dependence on government contracts:** A significant proportion of Boeing's revenues come from U.S. government contracts, particularly in its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment. This exposes the company to the vagaries of political winds, and makes long-term revenue visibility more difficult. It also creates additional accounting complexities.
* **Operational missteps:** Boeing has faced several recent operational challenges, including the 737 MAX groundings, which have tarnished its reputation, increased costs, and led to customer distrust. These issues have weakened its moat.
* **Execution and management missteps:** Execution and project management issues, such as the delays with the 777x and 787 Dreamliner programs, have negatively affected Boeing's moat by highlighting inefficiencies and shaking investor confidence.
* **Customer concentration:**  A significant portion of Boeing's commercial and financing revenue comes from a concentrated number of customers. This concentration poses a risk to Boeing’s growth and profitability. 

Despite these headwinds, Boeing's duopoly position still bestows a narrow moat, but it is much weaker than it was a decade ago, hence the rating of 2 out of 5.

> {: .warning}
 The moat rating is subjective. Other analysts, perhaps more optimistic, might give Boeing a rating of 3 or higher. However, given the company’s recent financial and operational missteps, a rating higher than 2 would not be warranted by economic fundamentals.


**Business Overview**

Boeing operates through three segments:

* **Commercial Airplanes (BCA):** Designs, develops, manufactures, and sells commercial jet aircraft (737, 747, 767, 777, and 787 families) and provides fleet support services. This segment is cyclical, with revenues and margins highly dependent on the demand for air travel and the replacement cycle of aircraft.
* **Defense, Space & Security (BDS):** Develops, produces, modifies, and supports military aircraft, rotorcraft, weapons, satellites, launch systems, strategic missile and defense systems, and network and intelligence systems. This segment’s revenues are largely dependent on U.S. government spending, making them less predictable.
* **Global Services (BGS):** Provides maintenance, modification, upgrades, and spare parts for commercial, military, and government aircraft, and also provides training and flight services. This segment's revenues are less volatile than BCA, and are less dependent on new aircraft sales.

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was performed using a 10-year forecast period. Due to the significant uncertainty associated with Boeing's future, a 3-scenario approach was used for years 1-5, with probability weightings assigned to each scenario. Years 6-10 use a simpler two-stage approach, and beyond year 10, a stable growth perpetuity was used.

 The valuation is highly sensitive to assumptions, and small changes can have a dramatic impact. Be sure to review all the assumptions and understand their drivers before using any valuation output. Also, bear in mind that the valuation was performed using information that is currently available.

**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations**

* **Revenue growth (years 1-5):** Three scenarios were created:
    * *Base case:* 3% annual revenue growth (pessimistic) - Probability: 60%
    * *Upside case:* 5% annual revenue growth (moderately optimistic) - Probability: 25%
    * *Downside case:* 1% annual revenue growth (very pessimistic) - Probability: 15%
* **Revenue growth (years 6-10):** 2% annual revenue growth (pessimistic).
* **Operating margin:** To estimate target operating margins, the medians of Boeing's competitors (Airbus, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman) were averaged, yielding 16 percent.
    * *Base case:* Gradually increasing margin from 10 percent in 2024 to 16 percent in 2029 and beyond.
    * *Upside case:* Gradually increasing margin from 12 percent in 2024 to 18 percent in 2029 and beyond.
    * *Downside case:* Gradually increasing margin from 8 percent in 2024 to 14 percent in 2029 and beyond.
* **Reinvestment rate:** The reinvestment rate was estimated using the sales-to-capital ratio (assuming the ratio of revenues to capital is 1.7). This yielded a reinvestment rate of approximately 40 percent in the terminal period. Reinvestment rate for the first five years varied depending on the revenue growth assumptions.
* **Tax rate:** Boeing’s marginal statutory tax rate of 27 percent.
* **Cost of capital:**
    * *Risk-free rate:* 3.5% (based on US Treasury yields).
    * *Equity risk premium:* 5.5% (historical average).
    * *Beta:* 1.2 (based on historical beta, from Bloomberg).
    * *Cost of debt:* 5% (based on Boeing’s debt ratings and corporate bond spreads).
    * *Debt/Equity:* 0.2 (based on Boeing’s capital structure).
    * *Weighted average cost of capital (WACC):* 8.5% (computed using the standard WACC formula).
* **Terminal value:** Based on a perpetuity with 2% growth and 10% return on new invested capital (RONIC), declining eventually to cost of capital (WACC) in perpetuity.


**Example Calculation (Base Case - Year 1)**

* Revenue: $81.8 Billion
* Operating margin: 10.0%
* Operating Income: $8.18 Billion
* Taxes: $2.21 Billion (27% of Operating Income)
* After-tax operating income: $5.97 Billion
* Reinvestment: $2.39 Billion (40% of $5.97 Billion)
* Free Cash Flow (FCF): $3.58 Billion ($5.97 Billion - $2.39 Billion)
* Present Value of FCF (year 1): $3.33 Billion ($3.58 Billion / 1.085)

Similar calculations were performed for each of the forecast years, for each of the three scenarios for the first five years, and then probability-weighted to arrive at the estimated values. The terminal value was calculated using the perpetuity formula, and then discounted back to the present. Non-operating assets were valued by multiplying excess cash and marketable securities by a factor less than one and valuing other non-operating assets by their proportional market value. A substantial amount of information is needed to do a DCF valuation properly. The above calculations and assumptions are meant to illustrate one possible approach and are highly dependent on future outcomes.

All the financial statements used for the base valuation of Boeing are available publicly in the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.


**Conclusion**

Based on the DCF valuation, with pessimistic assumptions and incorporating the risk of business failure, a fair value of approximately $170 billion is estimated for Boeing.

> {: .important} 
This valuation is based on a particular set of assumptions, and the actual value may be higher or lower. Given the considerable uncertainty associated with Boeing's future, it would be wise to apply a margin of safety, i.e., buy shares only at a price substantially below this valuation.

This valuation uses the financial statement information that is available publicly and incorporates the discount rates that are currently available. Different outcomes in the years ahead may cause these numbers to change. However, based upon a thorough discounted cash flow analysis as of August 2023, and Boeing's continued position as one of two leading providers of commercial aircraft, Boeing seems to be a good long-term investment at the right price. It seems to be fairly valued at the time of this valuation, and not an obvious value play.
