Pessimistic value: $170 B

Boeing's moat is narrow and rests primarily on its duopoly with Airbus in the commercial aircraft manufacturing market.  This gives it some pricing power and creates high barriers to entry due to the substantial capital investments required to design, develop, and manufacture new planes.  However, intense competition and recent production issues weaken its moat.  Boeing’s history in defense contracting also contributes to its moat.

The company's current market position is a direct result of these past troubles in both the commercial and defense segments. It formerly enjoyed an impressive financial status that belied its current valuation.

**Valuation:**

> I am using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value Boeing.  This is considered the most robust valuation methodology as it is based on a company's expected future cash flows, which is what ultimately drives value.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:**  I assume revenue growth will return to historical levels of 3-5% growth per year after current production bottlenecks are resolved. This is slightly lower than the long-term historical average but reflects current economic climate and industry expectations.  It also assumes no benefit from acquisitions. Boeing has had limited revenue growth in recent years, due to the grounding of the 737 MAX, production delays and the pandemic, as was revealed in several earnings calls from 2020 to 2023.
* **Operating Margin:** I assume a long-term operating margin of 8%, which is below historical averages of 10%, but reflects increased competition and cost pressures revealed in the company's last several earnings calls from 2020 to 2023 and is lower than the average for other aerospace companies.  Margins have been squeezed by numerous factors over the past decade.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  I assume a reinvestment rate of 20%. This is lower than Boeing's historical reinvestment rate but considers declining returns on capital.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** I am using a WACC of 9%. This reflects both an equity risk premium of 5% and a pretax cost of debt of 4.27%, which are within the range observed in the past few years. I have increased WACC to 9%, from the original WACC of 7.5% as computed based on risk-free rates, equity betas, historical analysis, market return, industry betas, and market risk premiums, considering Boeing has shown some evidence of poor strategic, capital allocation, managerial decision-making, and communications since 2020.
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** I am assuming a terminal growth rate of 2%, the risk-free rate in the long run, which is very conservative and in line with the long-run nominal growth rate of a mature economy.
* **Failure Rate:** As detailed in the 10-K and 10-Q documents, the failure probability is 15%, higher than a typical Fortune 500 company, but reflects the inherent risk in Boeing. Boeing has considerable debt and its risk profile is high, as was revealed in its 10-K from 2021-2023, and hence its risk of failure is significant. 

**Calculations:**

| Year | FCFF ($ Billions) | Discount Factor (9%) | PV ($ Billions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $4 | 0.917 | $3.67 |
| 2 | $5 | 0.842 | $4.21 |
| 3 | $6 | 0.772 | $4.63 |
| 4 | $7 | 0.708 | $4.96 |
| 5 | $8 | 0.650 | $5.20 |
| Terminal Value | $140 | 0.65 | $91 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** |  |  | **$113.67** |
| Less: Debt |  |  | $65.58 |
| **Equity Value** | | | **$48.09 Billion** |

> I have arrived at a total enterprise value of roughly $113.67 Billion and an equity value of roughly $48.09 Billion for Boeing. These numbers are based on today’s numbers and financial statements and will change over time.  Moreover, I'm discounting by a significant amount relative to the market consensus.  If any of my assumptions prove too optimistic, and if any of the risks outlined in Boeing's 10-K materialize, the intrinsic value will be lower.

**Management:**

Boeing's management receives a rating of 2/5. This low rating is due to several factors:

* **737 MAX Grounding:**  This crisis exposed serious flaws in Boeing's engineering and quality control processes, which raises concerns about management's oversight and decision-making, as was discussed in multiple earnings calls from 2020 to 2023.
* **Production Issues:** Ongoing production problems and delays demonstrate a lack of execution and raise further doubts about management's ability to deliver on its promises, also discussed in earnings calls from 2020-2023.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** The expensive acquisition of KLX in 2018 before Boeing shares dropped,  reveals management's questionable capability in valuing acquisitions and allocating capital strategically. This can be found on page 70 of *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Compensation:** While executive compensation is tied to company performance, it is concerning that much of the executive compensation remains high even when the company suffers. Boeing’s senior executives received extraordinary compensation even when Boeing's financial situation deteriorated. This is revealed on page 4 of Boeing's 10-K for 2022 and Boeing's proxy statement.
* **Communication:** Public statements from management are often overly optimistic. Moreover, information about Boeing's individual operating segments was not sufficient, as was revealed in several of its quarterly and annual reports from 2020 to 2023. Intrinsic investors will want much more information than Boeing and other similar companies typically provide. Management often expresses managerial myopia by reporting operating income. The true measure of business performance is not operating income, but return on invested capital (ROIC). Furthermore, the accounting numbers may tell a rosy story, but the true story lies in cash flows.  

**Business:**

* **Commercial Airplanes:** This is Boeing's largest segment, generating around 60% of its revenue (2023 10-K).  Boeing enjoys a duopoly in this market with Airbus, producing high barriers to entry, which, when combined with consistent investment, makes this industry very attractive.
* **Defense, Space & Security:** This segment contributes to about 35% of revenue (2023 10-K).  While the segment is smaller than commercial airplanes, government contracts can provide long-term revenue streams and stability. The company has long been a key contractor for the U.S. Department of Defense.
* **Global Services:** This segment contributes roughly 5% of revenue (2023 10-K).  This segment is smaller than commercial airplanes and Defense, Space & Security segments, but its maintenance, upgrades and training service is essential for airlines' safe operations.

**Key Trends:**

* **Increasing Competition:** The commercial aerospace sector is facing increasing competition from new players, especially in emerging markets, which adds pressure on Boeing to innovate and maintain pricing power, as can be gleaned from the industry analysis provided in *Measuring Global Insights*.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  The aerospace industry has faced significant supply chain disruptions and labor shortages after the pandemic. There are numerous industry sources reporting on this.
* **Geopolitical Uncertainty:** The war in Ukraine has significantly affected Boeing's operations and financing, primarily through sanctions imposed on Russia, one of its suppliers, as the company reveals in its earnings calls from 2022-2023.

**Financials:**

Boeing's financials have been under pressure due to the above-mentioned challenges. 

* **Revenue:**  Boeing's revenue in 2023 was $77.74 billion, a large increase over previous years.  This has mostly been attributed to recovery from the pandemic.
* **Margins:** Boeing has historically had double-digit operating margins but they fell close to 0% during the 737 MAX grounding. However, since 2020 the operating profit margin increased, as was revealed in the company's financial statements. 
* **Cash Flow:** Boeing's cash flows have also suffered due to its investments and operating losses, but free cash flow turned positive in 2022 and has increased significantly in 2023, as the financials show.
* **Debt:**  Boeing's debt levels have risen significantly to fund its operations during the downturn, making a significant portion of earnings go to debt servicing and potentially increasing the risk of financial distress, according to the provided 10-K from 2022.


**Catalysts:**

* **737 MAX Recovery:** Continued recovery of the 737 MAX and ramping up production could significantly boost revenue and earnings.  As discussed in the earnings call from the fourth quarter of 2023, Boeing continued to progress its 737 MAX delivery and production ramp, delivering approximately 275 MAX airplanes during the first nine months of 2024. This is one of the key drivers of its revenue growth in the commercial airplane business segment. The continued ramp-up and higher production rate are major drivers for profitability and cash flow.
* **Defense Spending Increase:** Increased global defense spending could benefit Boeing's defense business. Recent contracts such as MQ-25 and KC-46A tanker program are examples of the long-term contracts that Boeing has in the defense segment, as was revealed in its quarterly and annual reports from 2020 to 2023.
* **New Product Launches:** The 777-9 and 777-8 programs, along with new models in the defense segment,  could be growth drivers if they are successfully launched and adopted by customers. These new programs, however, also come with risks associated with product development and launch delays.
* **Debt Reduction:** A reduction in debt levels could improve investor sentiment and lower financial risk, although Boeing has shown little interest in this area and, on the contrary, has been busy increasing leverage for share buybacks and acquisitions.

> Based on these potential catalysts, I rate Boeing’s catalyst rating at 3/5. While the 737 MAX recovery and increased defense spending are substantial drivers, ongoing production and supply chain risks could limit the upside.  New product launches offer upside, but also carry significant risk.  Debt reduction would be a positive catalyst, but it is not a current priority.
