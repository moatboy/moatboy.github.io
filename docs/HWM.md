{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Howmet benefits from some customer switching costs in its Engine Products segment. Its titanium and aluminum structural castings for jet engines are complex products designed in close partnership with customers. Switching to a different supplier would be costly and risky for these customers, given the potential for product failure and significant financial repercussions. These switching costs provide Howmet with pricing power and contribute to the company's ability to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its cost of capital.

However, there are a few factors that temper this assessment:

*  Switching costs are higher for existing products than for new ones. As new generations of engines are developed, there is an increased risk of share loss to competitors.  
*  Howmet faces intense competition, which limits its ability to raise prices. Key competitors in the titanium castings market include Precision Castparts (PCC) and Arconic.
*  Fastening Systems, its second-largest segment, is more of a commodity business with lower switching costs and more intense competition.

Overall, Howmet has a *narrow* economic moat, leading to a rating of **2/5**.

**Management:**

Howmet's management receives a rating of **3/5**.

**Positives:**

*  **Long-Term Focus:** Management expresses a commitment to long-term value creation over short-term profits. In the Q3 2023 earnings call, CEO John Plant emphasized the importance of "managing the business for the long term." This focus is vital for maximizing a firm's moat.
* **Cost Discipline:** Howmet's management is focused on maintaining discipline in capital allocation and pricing. This is a positive sign, especially in a cyclical industry where overinvestment can quickly erode profitability. Plant repeatedly stressed the importance of cost control and operational efficiency in the Q3 2023 earnings call.
* **Industry Expertise:** Most of Howmet's executives have significant experience in the aerospace and/or industrial sectors.  Plant has been with the company (and its predecessor, Alcoa) for almost 30 years, giving him an in-depth understanding of the company's competitive dynamics and the nuances of these cyclical industries. 

**Negatives:**

* **Opacity:**  Howmet is not always transparent with investors about the true drivers of its business. The company often discusses the aerospace market in aggregate terms, not giving enough attention to the financial performance of the different business units. A good management team, on the other hand, will disclose details on the different sources of profits, revenues, and capital investments.
* **Capital Allocation:** While Howmet's management emphasizes discipline in capital allocation, the company's acquisition of Firth Rixson in 2014 for $2.85 billion has not been unequivocally successful. The transaction resulted in a large write-off of goodwill, suggesting that the price paid was excessive.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is limited and insider buying is low. A closer look at the company's insider transactions does not reveal large, regular open market purchases.

**Catalyst:**

Howmet's catalyst rating is **2/5**. The main potential catalyst for a significant appreciation in Howmet's stock price is the recovery of the commercial aerospace cycle. As air travel continues to recover from the pandemic, demand for Howmet's engine products will increase, potentially leading to higher margins and profits.  However, this catalyst is somewhat dependent on macroeconomic conditions and the ability of airlines to remain profitable in the face of rising fuel costs.

**Valuation:**

To estimate Howmet's intrinsic value, I'll use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, incorporating insights from *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company and *The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham. This valuation relies on a number of assumptions about the company's future cash flows and risk. These assessments should be made carefully using quantitative and qualitative factors, as valuations can be very sensitive to assumptions.

**Base Case:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a 2% annual revenue growth rate for the next five years (2024-2028). We base this on Howmet's conservative 2023 guidance and industry growth forecasts. (Q3 2023 earnings call)
* **Operating Margin:**  We forecast that Howmet will improve its margins to 18% by 2028, in line with its longer-term aspirations. (Q3 2023 earnings call)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Assuming a revenue growth rate of 2 percent and ROIC of 12 percent, the reinvestment rate is 16.67% (2/12)
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** We estimate Howmet's cost of capital to be 9%, based on a risk-free rate of 4.5%, a market risk premium of 4.5%, and a beta of 1.00. (Bloomberg, Damodaran)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** We assume a terminal growth rate of 3%, roughly in line with expected long-run inflation.

All figures used are from the consolidated financial statements of Howmet and are stated in millions of US dollars.

**Financial Statement Adjustments:**

*   **Operating Leases:** Howmet uses operating leases, and for valuation purposes operating leases are adjusted as follows: capital leases are added to the balance sheet and associated interest expense is treated as a financing expense rather than an operating one. We use a 5.2% pre-tax cost of debt (A+ rated debt) at the time of writing (May 2024) and a 20-year average life for operating leases to determine adjustments. (Howmet 10Q, Bloomberg)
*   **Pensions & OPEB:**  Howmet reports a net pension liability and a net OPEB asset. The liability is related to defined benefit pension plans and the asset is related to defined contribution plans. We will value these items separately. Defined contribution plans are treated as non-operating assets and are valued at market value if their values are marked-to-market; otherwise, their book values are used. Unfunded pension liabilities should be deducted from enterprise value as non-equity claims.  (Howmet 10Q)
*   **R&D:** Howmet amortizes the intangible asset created by research and development (R&D). We believe R&D should be capitalized rather than expensed. We capitalize Howmet's R&D by using an average asset life of 7 years and remove the effects of only the trailing adjustments. (Howmet 10Q)
*   **Non-Recurring Items:** We adjust earnings, invested capital and free cash flow for the impacts of acquisitions, and, for taxes and other items, we use the simple approach. This adjustment will be relatively insignificant, and therefore, any distortions caused by the incomplete adjustment, such as foreign tax credit amortization, are inconsequential. These nonrecurring charges and their corresponding amounts are shown in Table 19.2. To determine the total after-tax non-recurring charges, we take the after-tax average amount from these nonrecurring charges over the previous four years, and extrapolate them, and then adjust by the average ROIC on those items. These items include integration expense, amortization expense, impairments, and restructuring charges. 

**DCF Calculation:**

Using the assumptions above, we project Howmet's free cash flow to the firm for the next ten years (2024-2033). We then discount these cash flows back to the present using the WACC of 9%. For the terminal value, we assume a 3% growth rate in perpetuity.

```
Terminal Value = (FCF in year 11) / (WACC - Terminal growth rate)
                = $1.6 Billion / (0.09 - 0.03)
                = $26.7 Billion
```

The present value of the terminal value is $11.3 billion, and the present value of the free cash flows for the first ten years is $11.6 billion. Adding these together gives an enterprise value of $22.9 billion. Deducting net debt from enterprise value, adding back $223 million in cash and subtracting minority interest leads to an equity value of $17.9 billion. Dividing by the number of shares outstanding (233.4 million) yields a fair value per share of $76.5. The fair value estimate for Howmet Aerospace is then $17.9 Billion


**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Industry Cyclicality:** The aerospace industry is cyclical, meaning that demand for Howmet's products can fluctuate significantly depending on the broader economic environment. This cyclicality makes valuing Howmet more challenging and introduces an element of uncertainty into the valuation. 
* **Geopolitical Risks:**  Howmet is also exposed to geopolitical risks, such as trade wars and instability in key markets.


Given the intense competition, limited insider ownership, and Howmet's opacity in investor communications, I maintain a pessimistic and skeptical view and assign Howmet Aerospace a rating of 2/5 for its Moat, 3/5 for its management and 2/5 for its upcoming catalysts. Given somewhat negative assumptions, the DCF valuation yields a valuation per share of $76.5, with a fair value of **$17.9 billion** for the company.

This valuation is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate, and it's important to conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.
