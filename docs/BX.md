{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Blackstone's moat primarily stems from its established brand name, substantial assets under management (AUM), and its extensive network of limited partners.  These factors create a degree of stickiness for existing investors and make it easier to attract new capital, thereby creating scale advantages in distribution and deal sourcing. The sheer size of Blackstone gives it a leg up on smaller firms, particularly when it comes to negotiating terms with portfolio companies.  However, while Blackstone’s economic moat is wide, it's not a perfect fortress. As Warren Buffett stresses in *The Essays of Warren Buffet*, past performance is not a guarantee of future success.

{: .warning }

The asset management industry, while dominated by relatively few giants, is inherently competitive. The barrier to entry is lower than many realize, with anyone willing to expend a moderate amount of money, time, and effort able to set up shop.  And, as the intelligent investor should bear in mind, investment fees are being whittled away as more passive, low-cost alternatives become widely available. Competition for the most profitable businesses is fierce, and the ability of most managers to outperform is limited.  The ability to sustain excess returns on invested capital over extended periods is rare, and some scholars, like Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel and others, argue that any such outperformance is mostly due to luck and not superior stock-picking ability.

**Management:**

Blackstone's management is rated a 3 out of 5.  While the firm has a long track record of success and experienced executives, there are some concerns.

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation at Blackstone is exceptionally high. While some might argue that Blackstone's executives deserve every penny they earn, it can create a potential conflict of interest if their focus shifts to boosting short-term profits rather than long-term value creation.

* **Insider Ownership:** While senior management and directors own a significant portion of Blackstone stock, the vast majority is held by institutional investors.

* **Communication:**  Blackstone's management does a reasonable job communicating with investors, but as Michael Burry’s writings demonstrate, scrutinizing SEC filings and earnings call transcripts is essential to uncovering potential red flags.  For instance, looking at Blackstone's recent 10-Q filings reveals a significant amount of "Realized Performance Revenue" and an increasing percentage of revenue coming from performance allocations, rather than from base management fees. This may become problematic if investor returns cool off, or if the firm does not hit the incentive fee hurdle.

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  A close look at Blackstone's investments reveals that the firm is making large acquisitions in a variety of businesses, including real estate, renewable energy, and infrastructure. While these are areas with good long-term potential, success depends critically on the skill of the underlying business managers and Blackstone's ability to negotiate favorable purchase prices and maintain financial discipline. Moreover, the global credit and stock markets continue to be challenging, making it more difficult to achieve steady earnings growth for its various holdings and possibly putting downward pressure on the values of its most illiquid holdings.  Also, the firm has expanded aggressively into the life sciences industry, an industry with brutal dynamics, where success depends on having long-term vision and a willingness to ride out the many setbacks that invariably occur. (These points are based on Blackstone's 2023 SEC filings and their Q2 and Q3 2023 Earnings Call transcripts.)

{: .note }

Overall, while the executive team is experienced and skilled, their high compensation and the significant institutional ownership create a need for continued scrutiny of their decisions and motives. It's important to remember that managers work within boundaries set by a company's structural competitive advantage.

**Catalyst:**

Blackstone's catalyst rating is a 2 out of 5.  While the company has a number of potential catalysts for growth, the overall environment for alternative asset managers is becoming more challenging.

* **Fundraising:**  Continued success in fundraising is an obvious potential catalyst, but increasingly, investors are demanding higher returns with lower fees, putting pressure on traditional business models. As institutional investors build their internal capacity, they may move away from high-fee firms. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call).

* **Deployment of Capital:** Successful deployment of capital into attractively priced assets can boost returns and AUM, but the current market environment is making it increasingly challenging to find bargains. The high price of real estate is of particular concern. (Q1, Q2, and Q3 2023 Earnings Calls).

* **Performance:** Strong investment performance can attract new capital, but past performance is not indicative of future results. Further, if high returns were fueled primarily by cheap debt-and rising valuations, the future may look different if central banks begin raising their policy rate. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)

* **Favorable macroeconomic environment:**  A declining interest rate environment has been beneficial to asset managers and credit in particular, but this is unlikely to continue indefinitely as central banks balance inflation and growth. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call)



**Valuation:**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, using a conservative set of assumptions, yields a fair value estimate of approximately **\$87.5 Billion**. Given the firm's net income in 2022 ($3.9 billion) and free cash flow ($2.1 billion), along with its substantial capital expenditures ($3.6 billion) and growing debt, it is estimated that Blackstone will generate just $2.1 billion in free cash flow for the next year, along with modest growth and profitability over the coming 5 years.   The cost of capital is estimated to be 11%. The terminal growth rate is assumed to be 3%. The resulting equity value is derived after netting out other claims and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.

**Calculations:**

This valuation is based on the free cash flows to the firm (FCFF). Table 3.2 from Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation* provides two approaches. For simplification purposes, only the FCFF approach is used here. The free cash flow is estimated from the firm's most recent financials available from its SEC filings.

* **Free Cash Flows:**  Project a modest set of cash flows for the next 5 years, based on conservative assumptions about growth, margins, and reinvestment needs.
* **Terminal Value:** Estimate a terminal value based on a stable growth rate of 3% in perpetuity.
* **Discount Rate:**  A conservative cost of capital of 11%.
* **Value of Operating Assets:** Discount the free cash flows and the terminal value back to present using the cost of capital.
* **Value of Non-Operating Assets:**  Estimate from balance sheet.
* **Value of Equity:** Value of Operating Assets + Value of Non-Operating Assets - Debt 
* **Value per share:**  Value of Equity / Number of shares outstanding


Given the many assumptions involved in any DCF valuation and the fact that even slight changes in the underlying inputs can have a significant impact on the outcome, one should look at the firm’s operating history and the overall business cycle to develop a wide range of reasonable scenarios with accompanying probabilities. (See the discussions about DCF limitations and Scenario Analysis in Damodaran’s *The Little Book of Valuation* and McKinsey’s *Valuation*.)
