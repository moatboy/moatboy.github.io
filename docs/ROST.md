{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):** 

While Ross benefits from some scale advantages and a strong brand, its moat is narrow.  The off-price model itself is not a sustainable competitive advantage, as evidenced by the presence of competitors like TJX Companies (TJX) and Burlington Stores (BURL).  Ross’s scale advantages primarily manifest in its purchasing power, enabling it to negotiate favorable prices with vendors.  However, as we saw with Burry’s analysis of similar off-price companies, this advantage can be eroded if excess inventory floods the market. Additionally, brand loyalty in the off-price space is limited, with customers prioritizing value over a specific brand.  This makes it difficult for Ross to build strong customer switching costs.  Ross doesn't benefit from a network effect as its value proposition doesn't improve with increasing numbers of users.  

{: .note }

Note: While Ross' scale gives it an advantage, other players, like T.J. Maxx, also have scale and operate with similar business models.
 

**Management (3/5):**

Ross’s management team appears competent, as evidenced by the company’s historical track record of revenue growth and solid returns on capital. Barbara Rentler, the CEO since 2014, has extensive experience in the off-price retail industry. However, management’s capital allocation decisions warrant scrutiny.  While share repurchases have historically been a productive use of capital, aggressive buybacks at elevated valuations can destroy value (as seen in Burry's approach, buybacks are good only when done at reasonable prices).  The company’s recent foray into e-commerce is also a risk, as online off-price retail is an intensely competitive market.  Further, executive compensation, although not egregious, isn't tied directly to value creation metrics like return on invested capital. Insider ownership is low.

{: .warning }

Warning: While management appears to have handled the macro environment well, there are some risks associated with their expansion strategy.
{: .note }

Note: Insider ownership is low, which decreases confidence in management's long-term commitment to maximizing shareholder value.

**Business:**

Ross Stores operates in a highly competitive retail landscape. The off-price segment itself is seeing increased competition, with both online and brick-and-mortar players vying for market share.  Ross has historically maintained healthy operating margins and solid revenue growth by leveraging its large store base and distribution network to efficiently source and distribute discounted merchandise.  It primarily focuses on value-conscious customers, who are less brand-loyal than full-price shoppers.  A key differentiator for Ross is its treasure-hunt shopping experience, which creates an element of surprise and excitement for customers.

{: .important }

Important: The treasure hunt business model is becoming a lot more common, which reduces Ross' competitive advantage.

**Financials:**

Ross has consistently generated healthy free cash flow and strong returns on invested capital.  Its revenue growth has been driven by both new store openings and same-store sales growth.  Although operating margins have been pressured by rising costs (as highlighted in the Q2 2024 earnings call discussing cost pressures from higher wages for its workers and higher freight expenses and the effects of higher merchandise costs), there's been an effort to manage them in the current inflationary environment by adjusting selling prices to partially offset the higher costs (as the company CFO, Michael Hartshorn, stated in Q1 2024 earnings call).  

However, its debt-to-equity ratio has increased in recent years, due in part to debt-financed share buybacks. This leverage can amplify returns but also magnifies risk, especially in an economic downturn.  A key concern is inventory turnover.  While management has touted improved inventory levels in recent quarters (Q1, Q2 and Q3 of 2024 earnings calls all talked about improving inventory), there is evidence of high promotional activities and discounting at off-price retailers, so it would be appropriate to increase the reserve for inventory obsolescence if sales are falling or if any management changes increase its risk relative to the average company in the off-price retail sector.

{: .important }

Important:  Be wary of debt levels in an inflationary environment, when asset values can change radically, making leverage ratios unstable.

**Catalysts (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for Ross include continued market share gains in the off-price sector, successful expansion into new geographic markets, and further operational improvements to boost margins.  However, a significant catalyst that could substantially improve the company’s valuation is less evident. The company does have a plan to add additional 40 Ross Dress for Less stores and 25 Dd's Discounts stores in fiscal 2025, as revealed in the Q1 2025 earnings call, and it could be a good idea to follow how well these perform and how their addition impacts sales and margins (increase sales, but result in lower incremental margin due to new store opening, remodeling costs)


**Valuation ($45.8 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used to estimate the intrinsic value of Ross Stores, assuming a long-term revenue growth rate of 2 percent (slightly below estimated long-run US GDP growth rate), a target operating margin of 12% (below average for its sector peers), and a cost of capital of 8 percent. 
Ross’ current operating margin is about 10% (as revealed in their 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023), so we assume their operating margin will gradually improve over the next few years, but won’t be much larger than 12% because the off-price model has become commoditized and the apparel industry as a whole has been under pressure over the last 5 years.

{: .important }

Important: Being pessimistic and skeptical here requires us to use conservative parameters and look at current trends in the industry before plugging in the numbers.


| Year | Revenue Growth | Operating Margin | EBIT | Reinvestment | Free Cash Flow | Cost of Capital | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2.50% | 10.50% | $1,425 | $250 | $1,175 | 8% | 0.926 | $1,088 |
| 2 | 2.25% | 11.00% | $1,518 | $252 | $1,266 | 8% | 0.857 | $1,086 |
| 3 | 2.00% | 11.50% | $1,615 | $253 | $1,362 | 8% | 0.794 | $1,081 |
| 4 | 2.00% | 12.00% | $1,723 | $255 | $1,468 | 8% | 0.735 | $1,079 |
| 5 | 2.00% | 12.00% | $1,770 | $256 | $1,514 | 8% | 0.681 | $1,031 |
| Terminal | 2.00% | 12.00% |  |  |  | 8% | 12.50 | $33,412| 

{: .note }

Note:  Current revenue = 19,521 (from 10-K filing for Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2023). Reinvestment Rate = 1-(Free Cash Flow/After tax operating Income), Terminal value at end of year 5 = (After tax operating income in Year 5) *(1-Reinvestment Rate)/(Cost of capital - Stable growth rate), PV at Year 0 = Terminal Value * Discount Factor of Year 5.



Value of Operating Assets = $44,130 million

{: .important }

Important: It is important to state that there's a considerable amount of uncertainty associated with these inputs, particularly concerning where the company goes next, which includes their recent CEO change and growth in the off-price market. All of the company’s real estate was leased at 2023 fiscal year end. This amount of uncertainty may be an important determinant of whether or not we should place any investment into Ross Stores.

To convert the value of operating assets to equity value, we need to account for the cash and marketable securities held by the company, net out the debt, and adjust for other factors, such as minority interests.

| Item | Value (in $ millions) |
|---|---|
| Value of Operating Assets | $44,130 |
| +Cash and marketable securities | $4,214 |
| +Value of minority interests | $0 |
| –Value of Debt | $5,968 |
| Equity Value | $42,376|


Number of Shares outstanding:  300 million (from the Q3 2024 earnings call). 

Value per share = Equity Value / Number of shares outstanding = $42,376 / 300 = $141.25

{: .important }

Important: This is considerably higher than ROST's current trading price, but it assumes a significant improvement in the company's business, which is not particularly likely given current market conditions and the company's heavy dependence on brick-and-mortar locations.
