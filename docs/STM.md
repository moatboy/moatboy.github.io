{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5)**

While STM operates in a growing and strategically important industry, its moat is narrow. 

{: .important }
* **Limited Differentiation:** STM faces intense competition from other large semiconductor companies, including Texas Instruments, Infineon, and NXP.  While STM has a broad product portfolio, much of its revenue comes from commodity-like products that offer little pricing power.
* **Switching Costs Exist, but are not High:** While there are some switching costs associated with embedding STM's chips into customer products, these costs are not insurmountable for large customers with sufficient resources.  Smaller competitors can sometimes successfully replicate STM's process innovations, thus eroding any cost advantage STM might temporarily possess.
* **Scale is an Advantage, but not a Decisive One:**  While STM benefits from economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution, its massive size can become a bureaucratic impediment to innovation and adaptation to changes in customer demand.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

STM's management receives a middling rating due to a mixed record on capital allocation, communication, and insider ownership:

{: .note }
* **Capital Allocation:** STM has engaged in share repurchases, a positive signal when a company believes its shares are undervalued. However, STM’s capital expenditures relative to its revenues have been declining over time, which could indicate underinvestment, although potentially beneficial if competitors are overinvesting. Its history of acquisitions has yielded mixed results, particularly regarding its earlier acquisitions in the mobile handset market in 1999-2002.  The company sold a portion of Nortel Networks to reduce cash burn in 2000.  (Q2 2000 Earnings Call)
{: .note }
* **Communication:**  STM provides segment information, useful to analysts and investors, but does not provide the same level of detail about each individual business unit as, for example, Texas Instruments. Also, STM has not consistently communicated candorly about its successes and failures.  For instance, its Q3 2011 disclosure of ongoing legal proceedings did not adequately convey the potential financial burden. (Form 6-K, November 25, 2011)
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is largely incentive-based, which can be motivating, but also potentially encourages short-term decision-making. 
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership, while present, is not significant enough to fully align management and shareholder interests.

**Catalyst Assessment (3/5)**

STM has a few potential catalysts that could drive its share price:

* **Industry Growth:** The semiconductor industry is expected to experience continued growth, driven by increasing demand for chips in diverse applications, from automotive and industrial to personal electronics and artificial intelligence.  This industry tailwind should benefit STM.
* **Emerging Market Expansion:**  STM's presence in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, could drive growth as these economies continue to expand and modernize.
{: .note }
* **New Product/Service Development:** STM's commitment to R&D suggests that new and improved product and service offerings could drive future revenue growth and increase profitability. In Q3 2011 the CEO touted STM's progress in the booming market for smartphones. (Q3 2011 Earnings Call)

**Business and Financial Analysis**

{: .note }
* **Revenues Distribution:** STM's revenues are diversified across multiple sectors, although it is heavily reliant on cyclically sensitive markets. STM has recently focused on the booming markets for automotive and industrial microcontrollers. (Form 20-F, November 25, 2022)
{: .warning }
* **Industry Trends:** The semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a slowdown after several years of very high growth rates.  There are long-term risks due to increasing competition, particularly from East Asian producers. (Counterpoint Global Moat Report)
{: .warning }
* **Margins:**  STM's margins have generally been healthy but remain below those of some of its more specialized competitors. The recent chip shortage allowed STM to raise prices, but its ability to maintain elevated margins will be tested as the industry supply-demand balance returns to a more normal state. (Q3 2022 Earnings Call)
* **Competitive Landscape:** STM operates in a highly competitive industry. Maintaining its competitive position over the long term will require ongoing investments in R&D and successful new product launches.
* **Financial Performance:** STM has delivered strong financial performance in recent years, boosted by the chip shortage. However, its long-term performance has been less consistent. 

**Valuation (€31.25 Billion)**

A **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model is used to estimate STM’s intrinsic value.  A five-year explicit forecast period is used, followed by a continuing value estimate.  Because STM operates in cyclical markets and the recent industry boom years are unsustainable, fairly conservative assumptions are used in this model.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Real GDP growth of 2.5% annually for the Eurozone, and nominal revenue growth of 3.0% annually for STM in the explicit forecast period. This revenue growth comes mainly from organic growth (sales, marketing, and pricing).
* **Operating Margin:** Gradually increasing margins of 27 percent by year 5.
* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** 1.30 (reflects increasing efficiency in generating revenues as the company matures)
* **Tax Rate:** 22% (France’s corporate tax rate)
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Initially 50% of after-tax operating income, dropping to 30% by year 5
* **Cost of Capital:**  Based on an implied beta of 0.8, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, and a risk-free rate of 3%, the cost of equity is estimated at 6.6%. STM’s cost of debt is assumed to be 5.2%.  This leads to a WACC of 6.2% after weighting for capital structure.
* **Terminal Value:**  Based on a stable growth rate of 2.5% and a return on new invested capital (RONIC) of 10%, consistent with its peers.

**Calculations:**

* **NOPLAT** (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes) is projected for each year of the explicit forecast period based on the assumptions above.
* **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** is calculated by subtracting reinvestment from NOPLAT.
* **Present value of FCF** is calculated by discounting each year's FCF by the WACC.
* **Continuing Value** is estimated using the formula: (NOPLAT * (1 - Reinvestment Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Stable Growth Rate).
* **Present value of continuing value** is added to the present value of FCF to arrive at the enterprise value.
* **Value of Non-Operating Assets** (primarily cash, marketable securities, and nonconsolidated subsidiaries) is added to the enterprise value to arrive at firm value.
* **Value of debt, debt equivalents and minority interests** is subtracted from firm value to arrive at equity value.
* **Equity value** is divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the value per share.

Following the above DCF model, STM’s estimated value is approximately **€31.25 billion**. The weighted average cost of capital varies from year to year in the explicit forecast period.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Recent Concerns:** STM’s recent share price decline reflects investor concerns about a potential slowdown in the semiconductor industry. The company's reliance on cyclical markets makes it vulnerable to economic downturns.
* **Management's Response:** In the Q3 2022 earnings call, management acknowledged the challenges posed by the industry downturn but expressed confidence in STM's long-term growth potential. They highlighted the company's diverse product portfolio and its focus on key growth markets.
