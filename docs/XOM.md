## Exxon Mobil (XOM) | Moat: 3 / 5 | Valuation: $323 Billion

ExxonMobil is one of the largest publicly traded international integrated oil and gas companies, operating across the upstream (exploration and production), downstream (refining, marketing, and chemical products), and chemical product segments. 

**Business Overview**

ExxonMobil's business is fundamentally tied to the cyclical nature of commodity prices. The upstream segment, though the most profitable, is highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Downstream and chemical products, while also impacted by commodity prices, provide some degree of counter-cyclical stability.

**Moat Analysis**

While ExxonMobil benefits from some scale advantages, its moat is weakening.

* **Scale:** As one of the largest players, ExxonMobil benefits from economies of scale, particularly in the upstream segment. This includes cost advantages in exploration, production, and logistics.  However, as noted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, scale alone is not a sufficient moat, and the rise of smaller, more nimble competitors may erode these advantages over time.  Further, scale advantages are not easily transferable across segments. While ExxonMobil is a large player in upstream, it faces significant competition in downstream (refining & marketing), where other integrated players and independent refiners operate.
* **Cost Advantage:** ExxonMobil has historically been a low-cost producer, enabling it to remain profitable even during periods of low commodity prices. However, as explored in *Valuation*, cost advantages can be fleeting, particularly in cyclical industries.  Technological innovations and efficiency improvements by competitors can quickly erode existing cost advantages.  In addition, the drive for renewable energy sources may pose a long-term threat to the firm's cost structure.
* **Intangible Assets:**  ExxonMobil has well-established brands, but the brand value in commodity-driven industries is generally weak. As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, a brand creates a moat only if it increases a customer's willingness to pay.  This is rarely the case with commodity products.  
* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs for customers are minimal in the downstream segment.  Customers can easily switch gas stations based on price or convenience. 

**Moat Rating Justification:** ExxonMobil's moat receives a rating of 3 out of 5. While scale and cost advantages are present, they are not as strong and durable as in some other industries.  The transition to renewable energy sources and increasing competition could weaken the moat further.  The company lacks any significant switching costs or powerful intangible asset advantages.

**Valuation**

Given the cyclical nature of ExxonMobil's business, a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation is employed, using a business-as-usual approach rather than the simpler, but more misleading, relative valuation approach.

**Key Assumptions & Calculations**

* **Revenue Growth:** Historical analysis of ExxonMobil and comparable integrated oil and gas companies (from the provided 10-K documents) suggests that future growth will be in the 0% to 3% range, reflecting the relative maturity of the industry. To err on the side of pessimism, a 1% growth rate is used.  
* **Operating Margin:** The historical data indicates operating margins have been in the 6.5%-14% range.  A normalized rate of 9% is applied, slightly below the historical average.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Consistent with the assumptions about relatively moderate growth, a reinvestment rate of 20% is assumed.
* **Cost of Capital:** An equity risk premium of 5.5% is used, consistent with the suggestions in *Valuation* and lower than historical returns to account for market risk. A pre-tax cost of debt of 3.5% is determined by looking at the firm's bond yields (from the 10-K). The tax rate of 25% is based on effective tax rate from previous years.  These values, combined with the company's current capital structure (60% equity), yield a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8%. (WACC = (60% x 9%) + (40% x 3.5% x (1-25%)) = 8%)
* **Terminal Value:** Consistent with the relative maturity of the business, long-term growth is assumed to be 2% which equals the long run US economic growth rate.
* **Probability of Distress:** Given ExxonMobil's size and financial strength, the probability of distress is considered minimal, and therefore disregarded in this valuation.

Based on these inputs, using the methodology outlined in *Valuation* and *The Little Book of Valuation* and discounting cash flows over 15 years, a DCF valuation of operating assets is about $357B. Nonoperating assets (as gleaned from the balance sheet data in the 10-K) are estimated at approximately $11B, valuing excess cash at approximately $3B and other financial assets at roughly $8B. Adding operating asset value and nonoperating asset value yields an enterprise value of around $368 billion.  Subtracting a net debt of roughly $45 billion (Total debt of $49B less cash of $3B) yields an equity value of about $323 Billion.

**Disclaimer:** This valuation is based on publicly available information and personal judgment.  It should not be construed as investment advice. Conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.  As highlighted in *The Little Book of Valuation*, even with a carefully considered model, any valuation contains inherent uncertainty, and the future is impossible to know with certainty. This is especially true given current geopolitical turmoil and the transition to renewable energy.
