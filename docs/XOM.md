Pessimistic value: $375 B

Exxon Mobil (XOM) possesses a wide moat, primarily derived from its integrated business model and scale advantages within the energy sector.  These advantages translate into a cost of equity that is lower than most of its competitors. As Damodaran points out in "The Little Book of Valuation," cost advantages are a powerful source of competitive advantage, especially in commodity industries where price is often the deciding factor for customers.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Business Overview**

* **Integrated Model:** Exxon Mobil benefits from its vertically integrated structure, encompassing upstream (exploration, development, and production), downstream (refining, marketing, and supply), and chemical operations. This integration creates cost efficiencies and smoother earnings. In the second quarter 2024 earnings call, Darren Woods, CEO of ExxonMobil, emphasized the significance of integration by stating, "... integration is a real competitive advantage and strength in the way that we approach the business ...".
* **Scale and Global Reach:**  Exxon Mobil's massive scale makes it a formidable competitor. As Dorsey states in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," scale economies are a potent moat. ExxonMobil's earnings call transcripts and 10-K filings consistently highlight their global footprint and operational efficiencies in managing large projects. As the largest publicly traded international integrated oil and gas company, Exxon Mobil has an undeniable edge in terms of negotiating power, resource access, and distribution networks, which translate into a lower cost structure than most competitors.
* **Industry Trends:**  The energy industry is undergoing a transformation driven by the energy transition.  Demand for oil is uncertain, with projections varying widely. Exxon Mobil is exposed to regulatory changes and environmental regulations concerning carbon emissions, which creates uncertainty and affects its long-term value and cash flows. While government initiatives to accelerate the use of renewables may increase costs and accelerate the energy transition, these changes are unlikely to destroy ExxonMobil's business, though they may cause some damage.
* **Differentiation:**  Exxon Mobil's brand and reputation for quality, although not as much of a differentiating factor as it might have been in the past, still holds some weight. However, in a world increasingly concerned about climate change, its brand might become a liability.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The energy sector is highly competitive.  As Damodaran states in "The Little Book of Valuation," moats matter most in industries with low switching costs, like energy products. Exxon Mobil faces competition from national oil companies, other integrated firms, and independent producers.  Additionally, refining has become highly competitive over the past couple of decades. While competitive, Exxon Mobil is able to hold its own, as evident in its profitability levels.

**Financial Analysis**

{: .important }

XOM's financials over the past several years (2019-2023) reveal declining revenues, but a resurgence in profitability in 2022-2023. As per Graham in "The Intelligent Investor," we need to analyze long-term fundamentals to truly assess value.

* **Revenues:** From 2019 to 2021, ExxonMobil's revenue declined substantially, reflecting a combination of weaker industry conditions and decreased demand. However, it has been showing recovery in recent years. The company earned $414 billion in revenue in 2023, compared to $285 billion in 2021. This rebound suggests a better market environment but needs to be viewed in the context of historical cycles and oil price fluctuations.  
* **Margins:**  As indicated in XOM's 10-K reports, operating margins have also increased in recent years.  XOM's improving profitability indicates their ability to capture demand-based premiums in the energy market.  A higher margin is essential for building and expanding upon the company's operations. In the second quarter 2024 earnings call, Jennifer Driscoll, VP, Investor Relations and Secretary, stated, "So our view is this year's results have been a real reflection of, I'd say, industry leading refining business..."
* **Capital Expenditures:**  Exxon Mobil's capital expenditures are significant, though they have been lowered recently, which is a positive.
* **Capital Employed:** I did an adjustment for R&D for 2019-2023 using the methodology outlined in Damodaran's presentations on intangible assets and R&D. The resulting adjusted ROIC indicates that Exxon is a good steward of its shareholders’ capital.
* **Cash Flows:**   XOM has been free cash flow-positive in recent years. Its strong cash flows allow it to invest in capital projects, pay dividends, and repurchase shares.

**Management Assessment**

{: .warning }

Management Quality: 3 / 5. Exxon Mobil's management seems somewhat lacking. Their performance over the past several years—and their compensation—has been mediocre.

* **Experience and History:**  The current management team has substantial experience in the energy sector, but its track record over the past five years has been unremarkable.
* **Communication:** XOM's management communicates regularly with investors and analysts, participating in quarterly conference calls. However, the management's explanations of the financial results and outlook sometimes seem vague and lacking in depth. 
* **Capital Allocation:** There is some evidence to suggest that capital allocation decisions made by management have not always been in the best interests of shareholders. Their investment in past several years—including the acquisition of XTO Energy—destroyed substantial shareholder value.  As Michael Burry points out in his articles, a good acquisition should offer a significant improvement for the acquirer. In the most recent acquisitions, XOM made realistic estimates of implementation costs and post-acquisition synergies. This shows management's learning over time.  
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, which might imply reduced alignment with shareholder interests. (This needs further investigation.)
* **Compensation:** Management's compensation is substantial, even given their positions.  

**Catalyst Rating**

 Catalyst: 2 / 5. The catalysts for XOM are more structural and long-term, not so much event-driven.

* **Energy Prices:** A sustained increase in oil and natural gas prices would increase XOM's profitability.  However, I am pessimistic about the likelihood of this happening.
* **Successful Energy Transition:**  Exxon Mobil's investments in renewable energy and carbon capture could eventually become significant contributors to the company's bottom line.  However, these are long-term projects with uncertain outcomes.
* **Improved Industry Landscape:** Consolidation within the energy sector, leading to a more disciplined pricing environment, would benefit XOM. However, the likelihood of this happening is questionable.

**Valuation**

{: .highlight }

Valuation Approach:  A three-stage dividend discount model with pessimistic assumptions yields an approximate intrinsic value of $375 billion for the company.

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Stage 1 (Years 1-5):**  A conservative growth rate of 4 percent annually. Dividends are estimated by growing last year's dividend by this growth rate.


2. **Stage 2 (Years 6-10):** A reduced growth rate of 2 percent annually. Dividends continue to grow for another five years before settling at 1.5% in perpetuity.


3. **Stage 3 (Years 11- perpetuity):**  Stable growth of 1.5 percent annually.  A terminal value is computed using the Gordon growth model.   The discount rate used is 9 percent, reflecting a modest premium to the estimated cost of equity of 8.4% (based upon the CAPM with a U.S. risk premium of 4.5 percent and the historical beta for the energy sector and adjusting for country risk using a premium approach and a simplified version of the equation that equates a levered and unlevered cost of equity.)  



**Overall Conclusion**

Exxon Mobil is a wide-moat company in a cyclical industry whose shares can be purchased at a reasonable price.  However, its growth is dependent upon commodity cycles, and technological change threatens its dominance of the energy sector. Management's actions have not always been reassuring.  Therefore, while I would recommend owning XOM, caution should be exercised in determining appropriate portfolio weightings.
