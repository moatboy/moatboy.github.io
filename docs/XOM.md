{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .important }

Key to understanding the value of the company is **its exposure to the price of oil**. Oil and natural gas have become increasingly important resources in the world economy and have historically been the source of boom-and-bust economic cycles. Commodity companies are often cyclical as well. Thus, in assessing profitability, historical performance, and future projections, we will be at the mercy of oil and natural gas prices in a big way.

{: .note }

The following analysis will be done from the perspective of a global investor-either a multinational company or an institutional investor with a diversified portfolio of companies.


**Moat Analysis**

XOM has a **narrow moat**, earning a rating of **3 out of 5**. This rating reflects the company's scale and integrated operations, which create cost advantages and some switching costs, particularly in its upstream segment. However, these advantages are not as wide or durable as those of companies with dominant brands or network effects.

* **Cost Advantage:** As one of the largest oil and gas producers, XOM benefits from economies of scale, particularly in exploration, production, and refining. Its integrated operations also create cost efficiencies. This advantage is reflected in XOM's consistently high returns on invested capital. From 1985 through 2023, the company's ROIC has averaged over 11 percent, compared with a WACC of around 8 percent.
* **Switching Costs:**  While less prominent than cost advantages, switching costs exist in certain parts of XOM's business. Long-term contracts and integration with customers create some stickiness, particularly in the refining and chemical segments.
* **Moat Erosion:** Commodity businesses are subject to cyclical forces that can compress margins and erode returns. While XOM's scale and integration provide a buffer, its moat is not immune to these forces. Recent concerns about climate change and the energy transition also pose a long-term threat to the company's moat. However, management is taking steps to address these concerns by investing in lower-emission technologies and expanding into new energy sources. As Darren Woods, Chairman and CEO, said in the Q2 2023 earnings call, "ExxonMobil remains focused on structural cost savings, productivity gains, and project execution excellence that continue to underpin our strategy. And we'll continue to leverage the strength of our integrated portfolio and pursue disciplined investments in high-return, advantaged projects."

{: .warning }

Although XOM's scale and integration do create a competitive advantage, the company's overall moat is narrow and can be challenged.  There's no easy way to differentiate your product from those sold by your competitors, when everyone is selling gas and oil.


**Management Analysis**

XOM's management earns a rating of **3 out of 5**. While generally competent, there are some concerns regarding capital allocation and communication that prevent a higher rating.

* **Capital Allocation:**  Historically, XOM has been a disciplined allocator of capital, focusing on large, long-term projects. However, some recent large acquisitions have raised questions about whether the company is overpaying for growth. In his 1986 Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett warns against using a company's own stock as "currency" when it is overvalued. As he states, "It is an expensive way to go to market and when the stock is overvalued and you do that, you risk a permanent loss of shareholder value."
* **Communication:** XOM's communication with investors could be more transparent, particularly regarding the company's long-term strategy in the face of the energy transition.  Aswath Damodaran, in *The Little Book of Valuation*, emphasizes the importance of transparency when valuing companies with "intangible" assets. As he points out, transparency becomes even more important for companies or businesses in the advanced stages of the product life cycle.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation at XOM is in line with industry peers, but the link to long-term value creation could be strengthened.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership at XOM is relatively low, which can raise concerns about management's alignment with shareholder interests.

{: .warning }

Despite the company's strong financial performance, some of its managerial choices raise concerns about whether management and shareholders are on the same page.


**Business Overview and Valuation**

* **Revenues:** XOM's revenues are heavily concentrated in its Upstream segment, which explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas. Its Downstream and Chemical segments refine, manufacture, and market petroleum products and chemicals.  In the Q2 2024 earnings call, it was disclosed that XOM derived roughly 82% of its revenues from its Energy Products segment and nearly 18% from Chemical Products.

* **Industry Trends:** The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and is currently undergoing a significant transformation due to concerns about climate change and the energy transition. The industry is consolidating, with larger companies acquiring smaller ones. This consolidation can create scale-based cost advantages for XOM.  However, government regulations and technological innovation are disrupting the industry.  Moreover, geopolitical risks are adding to the industry's inherent volatility.

* **Margins:**  XOM's margins fluctuate with oil and gas prices.  The company benefits from having generally higher margins than its peers because of its scale and integration. To deal with cyclicality, for valuation purposes, we normalized earnings, by computing a rolling average over time. The normalized operating income margin for the years 2008 to 2012 came to about 11 percent, reflecting the impact of the global economic crisis and the relatively low oil prices in that period.
* **Competitive Landscape:** XOM faces competition from other integrated oil and gas companies, as well as from national oil companies and independent producers. Its scale and integration provide a competitive advantage, but its moat is not unassailable. A key concern is the anticipated emergence of green energy companies.

**Valuation**

{: .important }

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, I arrived at a fair value estimate of **$380 billion** for XOM, significantly lower than its recent market value. This estimate is based on the following assumptions:

* **Growth:** We assume revenue growth of 1 percent in perpetuity. Although a 1 percent growth rate appears to be conservative, it is consistent with low but steady growth of the global economy, plus rising market share in a maturing industry where rivals are unlikely to survive the squeeze. In addition, a 1 percent growth rate is consistent with revenue growth for mature U.S. companies (based on long-run U.S. GDP growth of 3.5 percent and median long-term organic revenue growth of 5 percent) and reflects the long-term market forecast for refined products, lubricants, and other petroleum products. 
* **Margins:** We assume a long-term operating margin of 9.5 percent and return on invested capital of 12 percent, lower than historical levels and lower than peers, reflecting potential moat erosion and cyclicality risks.
* **Cost of Capital:** XOM has access to debt markets and enjoys a lower than sector average after-tax cost of debt of 2.2 percent. In addition, as of Q3 2024, XOM's total market value was around $550 billion. Given the relative risk-free nature of the company's financial assets, we used the risk-free rate of an investment grade firm. The company's stock price over the previous month has been volatile, so we used its average beta for the past five years. This implies a higher than sector beta but not very far away from its competition. At the time of analysis, risk-free rate = 4.4 percent, equity market risk premium = 4.0 percent, and unlevered beta = 1.00.
* **Risk:** We use a 10-year rate for the long term, reflecting market cyclicality and uncertainty about the energy transition.  We also apply a failure probability of 1 percent, assuming that even in the worst-case scenario the company continues as a going concern with a reduced valuation.
* **Capital Expenditure:**  XOM's net capital expenditure for the most recent year was roughly $23 billion.  For mature firms with significant growth rates, we use the average rate for prior years to approximate a company's expected future expenditure needs. Using an average reinvestment rate (capx/net operating profit after taxes) of 40 percent, XOM's projected net reinvestment in fixed assets should equal $23 billion x 40% = $9.2 billion a year.
* **Capital structure:**  The company is currently valued at a market debt-to-equity ratio of 20% and it has a debt capacity, so, in the terminal years, we will maintain that proportion of debt relative to equity.

**Valuation Calculation:**

1. **Terminal Value:**
Terminal value = (After-tax operating income in year 11) \* (1 - Reinvestment rate) / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate) 
   = ($24,491 million) \* (1 - 0.22) / (0.093 - 0.01) = $235,610 million

2. **Present Value of Cash Flows:** This value is obtained by discounting the cash flows from Table 3.9 for years 1-10 and the terminal value back to the present at a discount rate of 9.3%. The sum of these present values represents the value of the firm's operating assets. The present value for XOM's operating assets is $224,009 million.

3. **Value per Share:**
Value of Firm Equity = Value of Operating Assets + Cash - Debt
 = $224,009 + $40,864 - $83,875 = $180,998 million
Value per share = Value of Firm Equity / Number of Shares Outstanding
 = $180,998 million / 4,315 million = $41.94 per share

{: .warning }

This valuation is significantly below the current market price, indicating that the company may be overvalued.  However, given the uncertainty associated with the oil and gas industry, and the possibility of a resurgence in oil prices, XOM remains a viable investment, albeit at a lower price.

**Potential Catalysts**

Several factors could act as catalysts for XOM's stock price, including:

* **Higher oil and gas prices:**  A sustained increase in oil and gas prices would significantly boost XOM's earnings and cash flow. A surge in oil prices could be triggered by several factors, including increased global demand, supply disruptions due to geopolitical events or natural disasters, and a weaker U.S. dollar.  
* **Successful investments in new energy:** XOM's investments in renewable energy and other lower-emission technologies could pay off in the long run, boosting the company's valuation.
* **Improved communication with investors:**  Greater transparency about the company's long-term strategy and more detailed disclosures about its operations could improve investor confidence and lead to a higher valuation.
* **Favourable legal outcomes:** XOM faces numerous environmental lawsuits and other legal challenges, such as the ongoing antitrust suit with the Federal Trade Commission. Favourable outcomes in these legal proceedings could be a significant positive for the company's stock price.

{: .note }

These potential catalysts underscore the importance of closely monitoring the company's operations and the broader energy market.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

XOM faces a number of challenges, including:

* **Climate change:**  The company is under pressure from investors and activists to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, Woods addressed this concern, saying, "We're focused on the short term, but we're also pointed at the longer term. We're recognizing it's a business that is inherently changing."
* **The energy transition:**  The shift to renewable energy sources could reduce demand for oil and gas in the long run.
* **Geopolitical risks:**  XOM's operations are exposed to geopolitical risks in various regions around the world.

{: .warning }

These challenges could negatively impact XOM's earnings and stock price in the future. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh these risks before investing in the company.


**Conclusion**

XOM is a large, integrated oil and gas company with a narrow moat. The company benefits from economies of scale and cost advantages.  However, its moat is not unassailable, and the company faces challenges related to climate change, the energy transition, and geopolitical risks.  Management is generally competent but could improve its communication with investors and further strengthen its focus on long-term value creation.  Based on a DCF model and a somewhat pessimistic outlook, I arrive at a fair value estimate of $380 billion, lower than its current market capitalization.
