{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution (2023):**  Chubb's revenue is diversified across its business segments. The North America Commercial P&C segment comprises 45% of its net premiums earned, followed by North America Personal P&C at 15%, Overseas General at 20%, Global Reinsurance at 9%, North America Agricultural at 7%, and Life Insurance at 4%. Geographically, North America represents close to 60% of its net premiums written, while the rest are international, with Europe being the largest international source of revenues. 

* **Industry Trends:** The insurance industry is experiencing consolidation, driven by factors like evolving customer needs, economies of scale, technology improvements, and stricter regulations.  Also, climate change is adding to industry uncertainty, with the potential for increased natural disasters and rising sea levels.

* **Margins:** Chubb maintains healthy underwriting margins, consistently above 90% (combined ratio) for the past ten years, demonstrating profitability even during challenging economic conditions. Operating margins are more volatile because of investment income included in net income.


**Moat Analysis**

Chubb's moat earns a rating of 3 out of 5, primarily due to the following factors:

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Chubb has a strong reputation for financial strength and claims-paying ability, reflected in its A++ credit ratings.  This strong brand allows the company to attract and retain customers willing to pay for reliable coverage. However, brand names alone rarely give companies pricing power in the insurance business, which is often highly commoditized.  
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs are generally low in the insurance industry, but Chubb has some customer stickiness due to long-term relationships and bundled policies.  This offers a moderate edge, but not enough to overcome customer churn from price shopping.
* **Cost Advantages:** Chubb does not have significant cost advantages. While it is a large player, scale doesn't automatically translate into lower costs in insurance.  
* **Network Effect:** The network effect is not present in Chubb's traditional business lines.


**Valuation**

To value Chubb, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used with a 10-year explicit forecast, followed by a continuing value computation.  A business-as-usual scenario is assumed:

> **Key Assumptions:**
>
> * **Revenue Growth Rate:** 3% in perpetuity (in line with long-term global economic growth projections).
> * **Operating Margin:** 17% (reflects a continuation of its historical performance, with no material improvements).
> * **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% (in stable growth, reinvestment will drop).
> * **Cost of Equity:** 9.5% (risk-free rate of 4.5% + 5% equity risk premium for insurance industry, justified below).
> * **Cost of Debt:** 4.2% (after-tax).
> * **WACC:** 7.6% (reflects a conservative capital structure of 25% debt).

> **Key Calculation Steps:**
>
> 1. **Forecast Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes (NOPLAT) for the next 10 years.**  This is done by forecasting revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, taking into account prior-year trends and anticipated growth trajectory.
> 2. **Forecast Free Cash Flow (FCF) for the next 10 years.**  FCF = NOPLAT * (1 - Reinvestment Rate).
> 3. **Estimate Continuing Value (CV) at the end of year 10.** CV = NOPLAT<sub>11</sub> / (WACC - g) where g is the perpetuity growth rate. Using the perpetuity growth model, CV = $128,659 million.
> 4. **Discount FCF and CV back to today.**  This is done using the WACC as the discount rate. The present value of FCF is $20,607 million and present value of CV is $62,552 million. The sum of these constitutes the enterprise value: $83,159 Million.
> 5. **Subtract Net Debt and Nonoperating Claims.**  From this enterprise value, we deduct net debt and any other non-equity claims against the company (e.g., preferred stock, employee options, etc.) to arrive at the value of equity. Net debt includes debt from the balance sheet and other debt equivalents, such as operating leases. At the time of this valuation, Chubb did not have a significant amount of operating leases or other debt equivalents.  Therefore, the value of net debt is simply equal to the reported book value of its long-term and short-term interest-bearing debt: $19,144.
> 6. **Divide by Shares Outstanding.** The resulting equity value is then divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the value per share. With 448 million shares outstanding, the value per share is $140.13.

{: .note }

This valuation does not incorporate a margin of safety, which is a standard practice to allow for errors in estimations. Based on the conservative outlook and high-volatility in the financial markets, a discount of around 20-30% percent is recommended. Applying the 30% discount, a fair value is $85.12 Billion (448 Million Shares * $140.13/Share * 0.70 Discount). 

**Disclaimer:** This valuation is for educational purposes only and should not be taken as investment advice.  It's important to conduct your own thorough research before making any investment decisions.  Market conditions and company performance can fluctuate significantly, so it is advisable to regularly review your valuation.
