>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution (2023):** The company operates in four reportable segments: Americas Commercial HVAC (48% of revenues), EMEA Commercial HVAC (20%), Americas Residential HVAC (18%), and Transport Refrigeration (14%). 
* **Industry Trends:**  The HVAC industry is experiencing steady growth, driven by factors such as rising global temperatures, urbanization, and increasing demand for energy-efficient solutions. Transport refrigeration is also benefiting from growth in e-commerce and the need for cold chain logistics.
* **Margins (2023):** Gross margin: 25.9%, Operating margin: 14.4%

**Moat Analysis:**

Trane Technologies' moat earns a rating of 2 out of 5.  While the company possesses some competitive advantages, these are not sufficiently strong or durable to warrant a higher rating.

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Trane benefits from brand recognition, particularly in the commercial HVAC space. However, brand strength alone is not a significant barrier to entry, and intense competition limits pricing power. There is evidence of substantial goodwill on the balance sheet, which needs to be taken with a large pinch of salt. The brand may confer some customer loyalty, but in a price-sensitive market, this loyalty is often insufficient to prevent switching.
* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs for HVAC systems can be moderately high for commercial customers due to the disruption and cost associated with replacing existing systems. However, for smaller projects or replacement parts, switching costs are lower, opening the door to competition.  In transport refrigeration, switching costs are relatively low. {: .important}
* **Network Effect:** Trane Technologies does not benefit from network effects.
* **Cost Advantage:** Trane doesn't possess a meaningful cost advantage. While economies of scale exist in the production of certain HVAC components, competitors also enjoy similar scale advantages. Intense competition and industry consolidation are squeezing margins in the sector.

> There is no single source of competitive advantage that clearly differentiates Trane and ensures long-term excess economic profits.

**Valuation:**

We employed a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Trane Technologies using the following assumptions and the company's 2017-2023 financials from the 10-K filings for each year. We used a 5 year explicit model with cash flow discounting methodology. Given these financials, and given that the company has a variety of product lines and operates in various geographic locales, we used the annual reports of several competitor companies including Carrier Global, Johnson Controls, and Lennox International.

**Key Assumptions and DCF Model (using company's 2023 financials from its 10-K):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  We assume that revenues will grow at 3% annually for the first five years, in line with overall economic growth.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a stable operating margin of 14.4%, in line with the 2023 levels.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We will derive reinvestment from historical analysis. 
> $16759 − $12216 = $4543.
> $4543 / $16759 ≈ 27%. This reinvestment rate of 27% appears to be a reasonable assumption given that the firm has fairly stable operating margins and earnings growth over time.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Risk-free rate = 4%, Equity risk premium = 5%, Beta = 0.92, Cost of debt = 4.8%. Given an estimated 2023 capital structure of 13% debt and 87% equity, 
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated to be roughly 9.4%.
* **Terminal Value:** Growth = 2%, Return on capital = 10%, yielding a terminal value of $19.09 billion.
* **Probability of Failure:** We conservatively assign a probability of failure of 10 percent, with estimated liquidation proceeds of $0.1 billion (one tenth of the face value of debt), given the company's highly leveraged balance sheet.

{: .note} The model used is a simplified DCF model that assumes a stable growth rate in perpetuity. More complex DCF models could incorporate staged growth or cyclical factors, but these would be far too sensitive for this company.
{: .warning }
All assumptions are based on current data and estimates, and there is no guarantee these will hold in the future.
**Valuation Results:**

* **Value of Operating Assets:** $15.01 billion
* **Value of Non-operating Assets:** Assume zero.
* **Value of Debt and Minority Interests:** Subtract debt, and assume that minority interest equals zero.
* **Equity Value:** $14.4 billion
* **Value per Share:** $125 (approximate)


**Conclusion:**

>Based on our DCF model and a rather conservative set of assumptions, we arrive at a fair value of approximately $14.4 billion for Trane Technologies. This valuation implies that the stock is fairly valued at its current price.  Given the intense competition in the HVAC industry and the company's lack of a strong and sustainable competitive advantage, we believe a more pessimistic outlook is warranted. It is important to emphasize that valuations are just educated guesses; there are always risks involved and outcomes rarely match up to our expectations. Any investment decision should take these risks into account and align with your own risk tolerance and investment goals.
