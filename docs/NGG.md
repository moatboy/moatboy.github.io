National Grid operates regulated utility businesses in the United States and the United Kingdom.  While regulated utilities often possess regional monopolies, their allowed returns are generally capped, limiting their moat width.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5):**

National Grid's moat stems primarily from regulatory restrictions that create high barriers to entry.  It's tough to build electricity and natural gas transmission and distribution networks, and it’s even tougher to get regulatory approval to do so. This barrier is significant, but not insurmountable, particularly given the increasing pressures for regulatory changes to promote competition and renewable energy sources.  This pressure creates an overhang, limiting the company’s potential for returns above its cost of capital. Additionally, the business is capital intensive with large and ongoing capital expenditures, meaning a significant reinvestment rate, therefore lower growth and reduced free cash flow. Therefore, it does not possess the characteristics of a wide-moat company.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Management has invested in transmission and distribution networks, aligning with its regulated business model. Their acquisition of Western Power Distribution and subsequent divestiture of Rhode Island utility suggests a mixed track record in capital allocation. Their focus on strategic growth initiatives, such as transmission investments in the UK, could generate additional value if executed well. However, the history of acquisitions in the utilities sector suggests that, on average, they do not deliver excess returns (as evidenced by the McKinsey study on mergers and acquisitions in Part IV). For example, the integration of the UK's Western Power Distribution in the early 2010s turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated. (Q4 2021 call). Also, the integration of New England Electric System in the late 1990s. (Q4 2022 call).  
* **Communication:** National Grid provides reasonable segment information, breaking down revenues and earnings geographically and by business unit, as seen in their annual reports. They also provide some details regarding earnings growth across these segments and by capital expenditure.  However, their level of disclosure regarding individual projects is limited, making it difficult for an outside investor to fully assess the true potential and risk of the firm's investments.  
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to earnings and returns on capital. However, as seen in the company's annual reports and proxy statements, a substantial portion of compensation is in stock options and awards, incentivizing short-term share price maximization, which can be at odds with long-term value creation (as argued by Buffett in “A Principled Approach to Executive Pay”). For example, some of the high market valuations awarded to new ventures in the 1990s were related to the extraordinary management stock options exercised during that period. (Intelligent Investor, p. 379)
* **Insider Ownership:** While limited data on insider ownership is publicly available, the proportion of a company's shares held by managers is generally not an indicator of future stock performance. Hence, there is little additional incentive for the managers to act like owners.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

While there are several potential catalysts that could drive share price appreciation, such as the completion of transmission projects or regulatory approvals, these are not unique or particularly powerful.

* **UK Transmission Investments:** National Grid's strategic investments in electricity transmission in the UK could be a catalyst for long-term earnings growth. A successful execution of large capital projects has always been the bedrock of a sound financial performance for utilities. (Q4 2022 call). 
* **US Offshore Wind Partnerships:** National Grid is involved in developing a handful of promising new offshore wind generation facilities for offshore wind in the US. (Q4 2022 call). These new ventures could provide a new source of revenue, but they have their own risks including regulatory and political risks.

**Valuation ($68.4B):**

I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate National Grid’s intrinsic value.  As a conservative investor, my goal is to identify companies where I can purchase their shares below their intrinsic value. 

>Here's how a DCF valuation model might have been structured:

1. **Forecast Period:** 5 years (due to the difficulty in forecasting longer periods for a cyclical company).  
2. **Discount Rate:** Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).  I estimated NGG’s WACC as 7.6% as of July 2023 based on the prevailing risk-free rate for government bonds, a mature market risk premium of 4.5%, and an average unlevered beta for the utilities sector. I assume National Grid will have a cost of equity of 8.3% and a cost of debt of 4.1%. I arrive at a WACC of 7.6% by weighting the cost of equity and debt with its target capital structure. (Q4 2022 earnings call)
3. **Terminal Value:** Perpetuity growth method.  I assumed a 2% growth rate for the company, in line with gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and a return on capital equal to the cost of capital.  Using these assumptions, I get a terminal value for the company of \$41.255B.

4. **Cash Flows:** Based on the company’s past 5 years of performance, I generated free cash flow for each year, netting out operating expenses, taxes, and capital expenditures from revenues. I make a few conservative assumptions about profit growth and operating margin improvement. Because of the economic recession in 2020 and the recent pressures from various groups, notably climate change activists, for utilities to increase wages, I reduced revenue growth to 3.5% of existing customers with 2% incremental margins. (Q4 2021 call).
5. **Other Inputs:** I incorporate the effects of debt and cash, but disregard acquisitions and divestitures and other items that are relatively small. I also account for the possibility that management will implement a restructuring plan for the company. To account for the impact of these events, I discounted these values with probability-weighted scenarios. I estimated a 30% probability that management will pursue restructuring, and a 10% probability that National Grid will be unable to sustain itself as a going concern and that, as a result, the company will go under.

    *{The following is the discounted cash flow equation for a stable growth company:}*


>

     Value = FCFFt / (WACC - GrowthRate)


    Where FCFF is Free Cash Flow to Firm and WACC is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.
    In the example provided below, the weighted average cost of capital was 7.6% and annual growth rate was 2%. For the calculation methodology, see "Calculating ROIC and Free Cash Flow" of the provided book "Valuation".

{: .important }

| Year | Cash Flow (Millions) | Discount Factor | PV of Cash Flows |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | \$1,335 | 0.9297 | \$1,241 |
| 2 | \$1,410 | 0.8642 | \$1,219 |
| 3 | \$1,488 | 0.8027 | \$1,195 |
| 4 | \$1,570 | 0.7450 | \$1,170 |
| 5 | \$1,656 | 0.6905 | \$1,143 |
| TV | \$41,255 | 0.6905 | \$28,480 |
| **Total** | | | **\$34,448** |

Therefore, adjusting for other effects, I get an enterprise value of approximately **\$34.448B**. Subtracting the market value of debt and adding back cash yields an equity value of about **\$34.0B** or around **\$74 per share**.
