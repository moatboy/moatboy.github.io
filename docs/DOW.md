>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat - 2/5:**

Dow's moat derives primarily from scale in specific niches, primarily silicones and polyurethanes.  Scale advantages matter most in industries where price is a large portion of the customer’s purchase criteria (The Little Book That Builds Wealth). This is true for commodity chemicals as well. However, its scale is not insurmountable at the global level, and its overall moat is narrow. The company's shift away from commodity chemicals and toward specialty chemicals through acquisitions, divestitures, and internal investments is designed to deepen its moat, but the success of this strategy remains to be seen. The commoditized nature of Dow's products leaves it vulnerable to competition on price and subject to pressures on margins in a downturn. It has no meaningful pricing power. 

{: .important }

There are few, if any, "must-have" products from Dow; almost every product can be substituted (Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits). Thus,  Dow lacks the strong, brand-based customer captivity seen in companies like Coca-Cola. 


**Management - 3/5:**

Management quality is a significant factor in moat creation and maintenance. Dow's management has a mixed record.  

* **Positives:** Management has articulated a clear strategy of moving away from low-margin commodity chemicals to more specialized, higher-margin products.  They are actively managing the company's portfolio through acquisitions, divestitures, and internal investments. Management communication appears reasonable, providing some transparency into financial targets and challenges. As an example of candid investor communication, in the Q2 2021 earnings call, the CFO acknowledged the short-term focus of investor communications (as well as market reaction to quarterly earnings) by stating that "The stockholders' focus and our management's focus are on cash flow".  
* **Negatives:** Dow's capital allocation decisions have been mixed, with some acquisitions appearing questionable and returns on invested capital declining in recent years (exhibit 7.5).  Also, executive compensation seems heavily tied to stock performance. The company aggressively repurchases shares, which, while accretive in the short term, can be value destroying if done at elevated valuations and ahead of earning declines (The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America).

Furthermore, insider ownership, while existing, is not substantial enough to instill full confidence in management’s prioritizing shareholder value over their own interests.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** Dow operates in a global market with diverse end markets, including packaging, infrastructure, and consumer goods. Revenue distribution across geographic regions is also relatively balanced. However, the company's dependence on the cyclical housing and automotive sectors introduces revenue volatility. The chemical industry is subject to cyclical fluctuations in demand and supply (The Little Book of Valuation) and therefore needs to be approached with caution. Dow's efforts to focus on sustainability could potentially help differentiate the company and offer some insulation from commodity price pressures, but the impact is currently small.
* **Margins:** Historically, Dow's margins have been under pressure from intense competition and fluctuating input costs.  The move to specialty chemicals is intended to boost margins, and there is some evidence of progress in recent quarters.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Dow operates in an extremely competitive industry, with many large, global players. Competition is primarily on price, though some product differentiation exists. Dow's success hinges on its ability to maintain cost and operational efficiency and develop innovative products and services.

**Financials:**

* **Revenue growth:**  Dow's revenue growth has been erratic, impacted by the cyclical nature of the industry and its acquisitions/divestitures (see "Sales Variance" in Dow 10-K fillings).
* **Profitability:**  Dow's profitability, as measured by Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), has declined over the recent years (Exhibit 4.4, Exhibit 7.5). This is a major concern given that returns on invested capital are the primary drivers of value (Valuation). 
* **Capital Structure:** Dow has a moderate amount of debt. While debt can offer tax advantages (Valuation), it also amplifies earnings volatility and can create financial distress during downturns (The Little Book of Valuation). Dow’s debt levels are somewhat higher than the sector median and its credit rating is BBB.
* **Cash Flows:** Cash flow from operations has been volatile due to the cyclical nature of Dow's business, but it has generally been healthy.

**Valuation:**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with relatively pessimistic assumptions, we arrive at a fair value of approximately **$44.5 billion** for Dow Inc.

{: .important }

**Assumptions:**


* **Explicit Forecast Period (Years 1-5):**  Modest revenue growth, gradual margin improvement, ROIC increases initially, then declines toward the cost of capital (Exhibit 6.11).

* **Continuing Value:** 3 percent stable growth, ROIC equals cost of capital (recommended formula in Valuation).

* **Cost of Capital:** 8.65 percent, reflecting a BBB credit rating and moderate financial leverage.


{: .important }

**Calculations:**


* **FCF:** Project FCF for the next five years, based on revenue and margin projections.
* **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value using the perpetuity growth model formula (Valuation, page 216). 
* **Present Value:** Discount FCF and terminal value back to today using the cost of capital.
* **Non-operating Assets:**  Value any non-operating assets and add them to the present value of operations.
* **Debt:** Subtract the value of outstanding debt and other non-equity claims.

* **Value per Share:** Divide by the number of shares outstanding.


**Catalyst - 2/5:**

Potential catalysts for Dow include:

* **Successful execution of its specialty chemical strategy:** If Dow is able to meaningfully shift its portfolio toward higher-margin products and sustain pricing power, its valuation could rise.
* **Industry consolidation:**  Further consolidation in the chemical industry could benefit Dow through increased scale and pricing power.
* **Economic recovery:** A broad economic recovery could boost demand for Dow’s products and improve its pricing power.

{: .warning }

However, the cyclical nature of the chemical industry makes these catalysts uncertain.

**Concerns:**

* **Declining ROIC:** Dow's declining ROIC is a major concern and needs to be addressed by management. Dow's management must improve its capital allocation decision making and operations, rather than manipulating reported accounting results, to restore profitability and improve growth (Valuation, The Intelligent Investor).
* **Cyclicality:** The highly cyclical nature of the chemical industry makes Dow vulnerable to economic downturns.  A severe economic downturn could significantly reduce demand and prices for Dow's products, putting pressure on margins, cash flows, and valuation. In its Q3 2023 earnings call, the CFO stated that "We remain confident that demand for our products will grow in the long-run, while acknowledging that near-term volatility will remain high given the current global macroeconomic uncertainty."
* **Raw material price volatility:** Dow's input costs, particularly for oil and natural gas, are volatile. This volatility adds uncertainty to the company's earnings and cash flows and can reduce operating margins. In its Q1 2024 earnings call, the CFO stated that "We continue to be focused on the strategic transformation of the portfolio towards higher value products and reduced cost to serve."
