Pessimistic value: $170 B

Abbott Laboratories operates in a diverse set of businesses, including established pharmaceuticals, nutritional products, diagnostics, and medical devices. While this diversification can mitigate risk, it also makes assessing an economic moat more challenging. After a thorough analysis of ABT's financials, competitive landscape, and management, I assign a moat rating of 3/5.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

ABT's moat stems primarily from a combination of intangible assets (brands, patents) and a degree of customer switching costs in certain product lines (diagnostics, medical devices).  

* **Intangible Assets:** ABT owns a portfolio of well-known brands, especially in the nutrition segment (e.g., Similac, Ensure, Pedialyte).  These brands command customer loyalty and pricing power.  However, the brand moat is challenged by increasing competition from private-label products and a shift in consumer preferences towards generics where possible.  ABT's patent portfolio, while large, is vulnerable to legal challenge and has a finite life.  As seen in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, patents are "wonderful to have, but patent lawyers are not poor." (Pg. 34)  Constant innovation is key to maintaining the strength of this moat element.
* **Switching Costs:**  ABT enjoys meaningful customer switching costs in its diagnostics and medical devices segments.  As highlighted in *Valuation*, these high-tech businesses are sticky due to integration and retraining costs.  However, competitive pressures from new technologies and rivals are always a potential threat.
* **Geographic/Niche Advantages:** ABT does not have the same scale advantages as other wide moat firms like Costco or Coca-Cola. Therefore I am more pessimistic regarding its scale-based moat. I also don't believe it has any location advantages. The company does have some niche advantages that increase its profitability. 

**Management (3/5):**

I rate ABT's management a 3/5, reflecting a degree of skepticism about their long-term capital allocation decisions and communication.

* **Capital Allocation:**  While management has historically returned a substantial portion of earnings to shareholders (dividends, share repurchases), recent large acquisitions (e.g., Alere) raise concerns about overpaying for growth. The St. Jude Medical acquisition, while initially appearing successful, has faced integration challenges, reflecting a lack of foresight for potential issues, as suggested in *Valuation*. I am concerned by the number of write-offs associated with recent acquisitions.
* **Communication:**  Management provides guidance, but like many companies, their forecasts are frequently too optimistic, as Graham warned in *The Intelligent Investor*.  A lack of detailed segment-level data makes it more challenging for investors to assess the true drivers of value, and like Burry's comments in his articles from the 2000-2001 era, I want to see more detailed disclosure. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to financial performance.  While incentivizing performance is important, this can lead to short-term focus and accounting manipulation, a concern highlighted in *Valuation*.  I don't believe that executive compensation is too high.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, potentially reducing the alignment of management's interests with those of long-term shareholders.  

**Catalyst (2/5):**

ABT's catalyst rating is 2/5.  While new product approvals and geographic expansion can drive growth, these drivers are offset by growing competition and price pressures. I am particularly concerned about the long-term impact of biosimilar and generic competition on the established pharmaceutical portfolio. One potential catalyst is further unlocking of value through acquisitions in specific market segment, but I don't think that is a near-term catalyst. I am also keeping a close eye on integration of recent acquisitions and further streamlining and efficiency improvement programs for an additional positive catalyst. I believe management has been focusing heavily on those.
{: .warning }

There is a considerable risk that the current price of the stock is not adequately discounting for risk of biosimilars to Humira in the longer term.

**Valuation ($170 Billion):**

I value ABT at approximately $170 billion, below its current market capitalization.  My valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model using the following conservative assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:**  I assume an average annual revenue growth rate of 3% for the next five years, declining gradually to 2% in perpetuity, reflecting competitive pressures and maturity of certain business segments.  This is below the historical average growth rate but above the long-run growth rate of the U.S. economy.
* **Margins:** I assume an average operating margin of 20% in perpetuity, slightly lower than the companyâ€™s current level, reflecting increasing competitive pressures, particularly in the established pharmaceutical segment.
* **Cost of Capital:**  I use a cost of capital of 7.5% which is equal to 2.7% risk-free rate, plus 4.5% market risk premium, with country risk premium of 0.3%. I am using a 0.9 beta which is in line with other companies in the industry. I derive market risk premium from Damodaran's current expected returns. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** I assume a reinvestment rate of 40% in perpetuity, in line with historical capital expenditures and working capital needs.
* **Terminal Value:**  I use a stable growth dividend discount model to calculate the terminal value.  
{: .note }

 I discount cash flows to reflect risk rather than adjusting the expected cash flows, given the current low level of interest rates. 

**Financial Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  ABT generates revenue from four main segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices. The Established Pharmaceuticals segment, while still the largest contributor to revenue, is facing significant headwinds from biosimilar competition to Humira. This is the biggest risk facing ABT, and I believe it is not adequately reflected in the current share price.  During the 2023 Q2 earnings call, Robert Funck Jr., Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, highlighted the impressive growth of the established pharmaceuticals sales outside of Humira, up 22.5% excluding the effect of foreign exchange. This provides some hope for future growth, but the dependence on a single product is still concerning. 
* **Profitability:**  ABT's overall profitability is strong, with returns on invested capital consistently above 15%.  However, returns on incremental invested capital are declining, reflecting the company's mature business profile.
* **Debt:**  ABT has a moderate amount of debt.  I don't believe they are overleveraged, but I am considering potential for a debt-funded acquisition that could increase debt levels, a frequent occurrence for mature companies, as discussed in *Valuation*. 


**Other Considerations:**

* **COVID-19 Testing:**  The rapid decline in COVID-19 testing revenues has created a drag on earnings growth.  Management expects this business to continue to decline, as highlighted during multiple earning calls in 2022. I don't think there is much value left to be gained in this market.
* **Competition:**  Competition is intensifying across all of ABT's business segments.  As discussed in *Measuring the Moat*, competitors are always trying to erode moats, and I am particularly concerned about biosimilar competition to Humira and also about entry of other diagnostic and medical device companies into their higher-margin segments.  
* **Emerging Markets:**  ABT is expanding into emerging markets, which offer higher growth potential but also higher risk. I am concerned with the risks associated with doing business in those countries.
* **Litigation:**  Like many companies in the health care sector, ABT faces legal challenges. This is an area of concern, as it can increase the company's legal expenses.
