{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

Abbott operates through four business segments:

* **Established Pharmaceuticals:** This segment sells generic pharmaceuticals in developing markets worldwide. Competition is high, and revenue growth is modest.
* **Nutritionals:** This segment develops, manufactures, and sells adult and pediatric nutritional products globally. Key brands include Ensure, PediaSure, Glucerna, and Similac. These products are primarily sold through retail stores and enjoy strong brand recognition, but face increasing competition from private labels. Growth and profitability are good.
* **Diagnostics:** This segment manufactures devices and systems used in blood screening, diagnostics, acute care, and core laboratory diagnostics. Growth is moderate, and returns on capital are good.
* **Medical Devices:** This segment manufactures a broad line of devices, primarily vascular intervention, heart failure, structural heart, diabetes care, electrophysiology, neuromodulation, and pelvic health, as well as rhythm management. This is a high-growth business, with strong sales growth and very high returns on capital.

**Moat Analysis**

Abbott's moat stems primarily from its established brands in the nutritional segment and its innovative products in the medical devices segment. However, based on provided information, a comprehensive look at its financials, and an inherently pessimistic outlook, the assigned rating is 3/5.  Justification for this rating follows:

* **Brand:** While brands like Ensure and Similac provide some pricing power, the nutritional segment faces a growing threat from private-label alternatives, which could erode profitability.  As mentioned in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brand power is most potent when it allows a company to charge more for the same product, and based on current information it is unclear whether Abbott's brand strength translates to pricing power in the face of this pressure. 
* **Innovation (Medical Devices):** Although Abbott's medical devices segment exhibits strong returns on capital driven by innovation, competition is fierce, particularly from larger players.  As Dorsey notes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, technological advantages can be fleeting, and there is always the risk of competitors developing similar or superior products.  Given the rapid pace of innovation in medical devices, it is difficult to assign a higher moat rating based solely on current product strength.

**Valuation**

To value Abbott Laboratories, a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis was performed, using the company's financials from 2018 through 2022.  A conservative and pessimistic approach was adopted, incorporating the following assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume modest revenue growth of 2 percent for the next five years, given the mature nature of several of Abbott's businesses and growing competition. In the terminal year and beyond, we project a 1% growth rate, which is approximately the average for real GDP growth.
* **Operating Margins:** We forecast margins to improve gradually from 22% to 25% during the explicit forecast period and remain at 25% in perpetuity. Although Abbott’s historical operating margins have been strong, we acknowledge intensifying competition in the nutritionals segment as well as increasing price pressure from insurance companies. This relatively conservative margin forecast incorporates the need for higher R&D and sales expenditures to maintain market share.
* **Reinvestment:**  We forecast reinvestment to decline from 10 percent of after-tax operating income to 8 percent by year 10.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%, given Abbott’s financial leverage and equity beta of 0.92, which is based upon the median of unlevered betas for its peers, as suggested in *Valuation*. The cost of equity is 9% using risk free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 5% (based on long term historical data provided in *Valuation*). We also assume a tax rate of 20% and after tax cost of debt of 3.8% (see *Valuation*).
* **Probability of Failure:** Given Abbott’s established business and overall strong fundamentals, we assign a low probability of failure of 1 percent.  We also assume liquidation value equal to the value of excess cash and marketable securities.

**Calculations**

Based on the above assumptions, we arrive at an enterprise value of $160 billion, adding back $20.67 billion of excess cash and marketable securities, and subtracting $25 billion of debt as well as approximately $3 billion from operating leases. Given Abbott’s significant amount of share repurchases (1.2 billion shares repurchased over the past decade), we are using 1.23 billion shares to convert enterprise value to value per share.

**DCF Valuation:**  $150 billion (see *Valuation* for DCF model and calculations).

**Conclusion**

Despite Abbott's strong brands and innovative products, the competitive landscape and increasing pressure on margins warrant a more cautious outlook.  The $150 billion valuation reflects a balanced assessment of the company's current business and future prospects, acknowledging both its strengths and weaknesses while incorporating a degree of pessimism. It is important to emphasize that all valuations are biased, and that future market performance will invariably be different from the past.
