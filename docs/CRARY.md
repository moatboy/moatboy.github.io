{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Crary's moat is primarily derived from switching costs.  Farmers, once familiar with Crary's equipment, are less likely to switch to a competitor due to the time and effort involved in learning new systems and the potential disruption to their operations.  This is reinforced by Crary's extensive dealer network, which provides critical parts, service, and repairs, facilitating quick turnaround times – an essential factor during peak harvest seasons. These dealer relationships, built over time, also represent a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors.  

However, the moat is not without weaknesses:

* **Limited Pricing Power:** Crary operates in a commodity-driven industry where pricing is a significant purchase criterion.  This limits the firm's ability to command price premiums and reduces its ability to invest heavily in innovation or branding – two other potential sources of competitive advantage.  As stated in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, "Cost advantages matter most in industries where price is a large portion of the customer's purchase criteria."  Crary acknowledges this reality and focuses on providing value through lower costs rather than premium features.
* **Technological Disruption:**  While agricultural machinery isn't as susceptible to rapid technological change as other industries (like consumer electronics), technological shifts *can* erode Crary's competitive advantages.  The emergence of precision agriculture and autonomous farming equipment, for example, could reshape the industry and require Crary to adapt quickly to maintain its position.  As highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, technological change can be a "bigger worry for companies that are *enabled* by technology." While Crary isn't entirely dependent on cutting-edge tech, it needs to stay abreast of advancements to avoid becoming obsolete.

**Management (3/5):**

Crary's management team appears reasonably competent, demonstrating an understanding of the firm's economics and a commitment to shareholder value.  

* **Capital Allocation:**  The firm has consistently generated solid returns on invested capital, indicating effective capital allocation.  However, their historical reinvestment rate raises some concerns.  While reinvesting at high ROICs creates shareholder value, it's crucial to avoid "the bad kind of growth" that dilutes returns by investing in areas where the company has no competitive advantage. Crary's growth has been primarily organic and through reinvesting in existing operations, as discussed in their Q1 2021 earnings call, which suggests good capital allocation decisions.
* **Communication:**  Management's communication with investors is adequate but not exemplary. While they provide updates on their performance and market trends, their discussions of long-term competitive strategy and value drivers could be more transparent, in the style of Michael Burry's investor letters.  This could strengthen their relationship with intrinsic investors who value deep dives into company fundamentals and competitive dynamics.
* **Compensation:** Information on management compensation is limited in the provided financials. However,  executive compensation should be carefully structured to avoid perverse incentives. As Warren Buffett argues in his essays, compensation tied to ROIC is superior to stock options.
* **Insider Ownership:** Data on insider ownership is limited in the provided financials. Ideally, there would be significant insider ownership, similar to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, aligning management's interests with those of outside shareholders.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Market Share Gains:**  Crary has an opportunity to gain market share within its niche as the agricultural sector consolidates.  Smaller players may be unable to compete with the scale and distribution network of larger firms, creating opportunities for firms like Crary. This was echoed in Crary's Q3 2020 call.
* **New Products/Services:** Crary's 2020 Annual Report highlights a focus on new products and process improvements. While innovation isn't a core part of their moat, developing new products that improve efficiency or reduce costs for farmers could enhance their value proposition.

However, these are not likely to be game-changing catalysts.

**Valuation ($310 million):**

{: .note }

*Due to limited access to certain financial data, a simplified DCF model was used, focusing primarily on the near term.*

* **Forecast Period (5 years):** Assumed revenue growth slowing from current rates to 2% by year 5, reflecting intensifying competition and maturity of the core market. Assumed improvement in operating margins from recent levels towards a normalized long-term margin of 10%, reflecting some cost-cutting potential but also industry cyclicality.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Assumed a declining reinvestment rate, from approximately 67% to 40% over the forecast period, reflecting maturing of business, with stable growth requiring less reinvestment.
* **Terminal Value:** Used a conservative perpetuity growth rate of 2%, approximately the long-run rate of real U.S. GDP growth, and a normalized return on capital of 12%, to approximate a low-growth, stable-margin scenario.  
* **Discount Rate:**  Used a cost of capital of 9.5%,  based on a blended equity beta of 1.1 (considering peer group average and unlevering to remove the effect of capital structure) and a cost of debt of 5% (considering the firm's financial health and lack of available debt data).  
* **Other Considerations:**  Didn't apply specific premiums for size or emerging market exposure due to their specific niche, as Crary's 2020 Annual Report mentions most of the company's revenue coming from domestic sources. Did not apply specific discounts for the cyclicality of agricultural equipment, as the assumed stable growth and return on capital are already very conservative and reflective of a normalized business cycle.

**Calculations:**

1. **Terminal Value:** Terminal year free cash flow (estimated as year 10) = $199 million x 1.00 x (1-0.40) = $119.40 million. Terminal Value = $119.40 / (0.095 - 0.02) = $1555 million. Present value of terminal value = $1555 / (1.095)^10 = $630 million.
2. **Present value of forecast period cash flows:** Sum of discounted annual after-tax cash flows (from the 5-year forecast period) using a cost of capital of 9.5% = $206 million (approximately).
3. **Value of Operations =** Present value of terminal value + Present value of forecast cash flows = $630 + $206 = $836 million.
4. **Value of Equity =** Value of operations + Cash - Debt = $836 + $14 - $10 (assuming negligible debt) = $840 million. (No adjustments for minority interests or operating leases are made as this information is unavailable, and they are assumed to be negligible.)
5. **Value/share =** $840/33.71 (assuming shares outstanding to be equal to number of shares at the year-end 2019) = $25.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

Crary, like other agricultural equipment manufacturers, is facing headwinds from supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures.  Management mentioned in the Q3 2020 earnings call that steel prices and availability were a concern. While they implemented price increases, the firm's profitability might be temporarily constrained. These headwinds will be monitored to assess any long-term effects on their operations.


**Overall:**

Crary appears to be a reasonably well-managed company with a narrow economic moat.  While challenges persist in the agricultural machinery market, their dealer relationships and sticky customers offer some downside protection.  The current valuation, while seemingly reasonable, incorporates extremely conservative growth assumptions. Any upside surprise in future performance could significantly enhance shareholder value.
