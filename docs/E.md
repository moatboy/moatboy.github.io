## E (ticker symbol) | Moat: 3 / 5 | Understandability: 3 / 5 | Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5

E (formerly known as Enviva) is the world’s largest producer of industrial wood pellets, supplying a range of customers with a renewable alternative to fossil fuels.
{: .highlight } E plays a vital, yet nuanced, role in the global energy transition.

### Business Overview
E's core business centers on the sourcing of low-value wood, processing it into wood pellets, and then selling those pellets to power and heat generators.

*   **Revenue Distribution:** E's revenue is primarily generated through long-term, take-or-pay contracts with a relatively small number of large customers. These customers are primarily located in Europe, particularly in the UK, Denmark, and Japan, where there are national incentives for switching from coal to sustainable fuel sources.
    {: .note } A key factor for E’s business model is its long-term take-or-pay contracts which makes revenue more consistent over time.

*   **Industry Trends:** The demand for wood pellets, particularly in Europe, has been driven by the need to meet renewable energy goals, and also by the recent issues with Russia as a gas supplier for the continent. The shift from coal to biofuels is an ongoing global trend that is expected to continue to grow, while also increasing competition.
    {: .highlight } This makes E's market, both, stable and with growth potential.

*  **Competitive Landscape:** The wood pellet industry is competitive with a variety of players. While E is the largest producer, it competes with many small producers globally that have much lower costs. Also the large power plants that form E's customer base are often trying to source locally or near locally to decrease transport costs. The challenge for E and other big players in this space is their cost structure that is not optimized for these very low prices.
   {: .note } Therefore, it is critical to look at the cost structure of companies in the wood pellets market.

*   **Margins:** E has historically enjoyed decent profit margins but is very sensitive to supply chain issues and wood prices. Margins can fluctuate drastically, since prices for wood, as a commodity, can be volatile. These factors impact the profitability significantly.
     {: .warning } Even when the revenues are locked in via long-term contracts, the profitability can fluctuate and depends on a myriad of factors that are not necessarily directly related to E.

*   **What Makes E Different:** E's scale is its key differentiator. E is the largest producer, it has long-term take-or-pay contracts, the largest production capacity, and also has its proprietary technology and logistics that should, in theory, give it some competitive advantage. 
    {: .important }The problem, however, is that almost all these advantages come from scale, not from some durable form of competitive advantage like a strong brand or network effects.

### Financials Analysis
{: .highlight } E's financials have shown significant volatility and have been a huge point of concern and discussion recently.

* **Revenues** are large and have shown robust growth in the past, but the big question is can management achieve scale without destroying value. This concern is amplified by the volatility in the commodity prices and the inability to lock in fixed prices for a large amount of the operations.
* **Profitability** has been wildly variable, and the company has even faced severe losses, due to the company's inability to contain costs during periods of high commodity and shipping prices.
*   **Debt** is high and has been a major topic of concern as interest payments tend to eat a significant portion of cash flows when the company can't contain its operating expenses. This high debt has a huge impact on profitability.
*  **Free Cash Flow** has, for a long period of time, been negative, despite the huge revenue generation, which is another major point of concern.
{: .warning } The recent earnings calls and reports showed improvements in costs and expenses, and the company seems to be on the right track to profitability, but there is still a long way to go.

### Moat: 3 / 5
{: .highlight }E does have a narrow but fragile moat.

*  **Intangible Assets:** E doesn’t have strong brand power, and since its main product is basically wood, it is hard to imagine strong intellectual properties that can help keep competitors away. However, there is a lot of reliance on regulatory approval for biomass usage for E's products that provides a narrow, somewhat unstable protection.
    {: .note } Therefore, the intangible assets part is unreliable as a source of competitive advantage.

*   **Switching Costs:** There are no switching costs. The power producers that are the customers of E can change suppliers on a contractual basis without friction.
*   **Network Effects:** No evidence of any network effects.
*   **Cost Advantages:** Here is where E makes a strong case for having an advantage. E's scale and production process help to achieve a lower cost of manufacturing than many smaller and medium players, therefore, it has a narrow advantage.
    {: .important } The caveat, however, is that commodity fluctuations and shipping costs severely impact even the largest players in the industry.

Therefore, a score of 3 out of 5 is warranted.

### Risks
{: .highlight } E faces both macro and micro threats that are very pertinent.

*   **Commodity Price Volatility:** One of the most serious risks E faces is the volatility of wood and shipping prices. Since E's model is to sell a commodity, a large proportion of the price they can command is a function of market prices. Since there is no price power, E has to rely on its manufacturing and distribution to secure a consistent profitability.
*   **Regulatory Changes:** Government policies and subsidies are essential to the demand for wood pellets. A change in these government policies and regulations can drastically alter the financial condition of the company. Also, the green classification for wood pellet production also comes under scrutiny and can create challenges for the long term.
*   **Competition:** While E is the biggest player, there are a lot of small competitors that make it difficult for even a large scale player to generate returns on invested capital. The high barriers to *success* for all players and not for *entry* means that many competitors can stay on a losing proposition for far too long. 
*  **Financial Instability:** As mentioned before the high level of debt is a cause of major concern, and even with higher revenues if profitability is still not high enough, it could mean debt write-downs that will wipe-out any shareholder equity.
*  **Disruptive Technologies:** New technologies are always a threat to established business models. So although now, due to regulations, biomass has gained a level of popularity, if any new way to produce power or heat is found that is cheaper than biomass then that may have a huge impact.

**Resilience:** The resilience of E stems from its long-term contracts, its asset base, and its ability to leverage that asset base as long as prices are favorable. While the company can scale its production and lower its costs, it faces challenges that can severely impact the company's bottom line, namely the volatility of the market, regulatory changes and the financial pressure that is created by its debt. The management is now focused on cost cutting and better operating performance, which gives a positive perspective for the near future. However, the moat is still not very strong.
  {: .note } The long term success of E is highly reliant on external factors and how they will change in the future.

### Understandability: 3 / 5

E's business is quite easy to understand at a high level. It takes a very simple concept of taking wood and processing it to turn into a commodity, and is easy to grasp. However, when you dig into the details, the economic drivers of the company and the factors that effect its financial performance, it is complicated to understand. There are a lot of moving parts in terms of its logistics, supply chain, and the nature of its customer base. Also, because of the volatile nature of the underlying commodity market, and regulations, estimating the future cash flows is hard and requires a lot of assumptions that make the story convoluted.

### Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5

*   E has a large amount of debt, but now the debt structure has improved due to some maturity push outs. Also, recent earnings calls and reports have outlined steps taken to lower operating expenses and reach profitability, but all this should be carefully monitored.
* E's assets largely are based on the value of its production plants, which have proven to be economically valuable to the company but their usefulness can change if regulations change or any new technology comes along.
* E's current equity is small, especially when viewed with the mountain of debt it has. It remains to be seen what will be the outcome of the management's attempts to improve efficiency and reach profitability, and if those attempts will succeed in improving the balance sheet health of the company. Therefore, a rating of 3/5 is warranted.
    {: .warning } While things are improving, the company's balance sheet is still far from ideal.

### Final Thoughts

E operates in an important and growing industry, with some clear advantages. Its major drawback is the lack of pricing power, its high debt and operating expenses. The company's success depends almost entirely on macro-economic factors and its ability to lower its costs, making the future quite difficult to predict.
{: .note } E needs to improve its profitability further and make its financial structure more robust to be a truly worthwhile investment over the long term.
