Eni SpA is an integrated energy company operating across the value chain, from exploration and production to refining and marketing, and chemicals. While it exhibits some characteristics of a moat, its overall strength and durability earn a rating of 2/5.  This modest moat rating is due to the cyclical nature of the commodity business, challenges to reinvestment in renewables, and regulatory risks, particularly the effects of the EU Green Deal.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


> I'm applying a more rigorous framework than the one presented in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth* for finding moats because the commodity business is highly cyclical, making establishing a moat in this sector much more difficult than in a sector like software. Furthermore, Eni is subject to regulatory risks that are difficult to fully capture in the valuation. This makes a higher moat rating unwarranted.

**Moat Sources:**

* **Cost Advantages:** Eni benefits somewhat from integrated operations and economies of scale, which can occasionally lead to lower costs than smaller, independent producers. These cost advantages, however, are not insurmountable and can be challenged by competitors with access to cheaper resources or more efficient technology. Further, reinvestment needs in renewables and high legacy asset write-downs lessen Eni's overall cost competitiveness. (Source: The Little Book that Builds Wealth, Chapter Six)
* **Intangible Assets:**  The Eni brand has some recognition, which may give it a slight advantage in attracting and retaining customers. However, brand loyalty is limited in the commodity business, where customers primarily focus on price.  This limits the strength of its intangible asset moat. (Source: The Little Book that Builds Wealth, Chapter Three)
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs in the refining and marketing segment are relatively low for Eni's customers. This weakens any potential switching cost advantage. (Source: The Little Book that Builds Wealth, Chapter Four)
* **Network Effect:** Eni's business model does not derive a competitive advantage from network effects. (Source: The Little Book that Builds Wealth, Chapter Five)

> During Eni's Q2 2023 earnings call, the CFO stated that the company's strategy moving forward is to focus on “upstream growth and portfolio resilience" and "gas and power decarbonization." The company's long-term focus on exploration and production of oil and gas gives it a first mover advantage. Exploration and Production assets are likely to be part of Eni SpA's competitive advantage for a long time. Nevertheless, Eni has announced that it is investing in renewables, particularly focusing on bio-refining, blue hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and floating offshore wind farms. Given the highly fragmented nature of the renewable energy industry, as well as its novelty and high regulatory uncertainty, its not clear to us how sustainable high ROICs will be in this segment. This decreases our rating of Eni SpA's moat.

**Management Evaluation (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Management’s capital allocation decisions have been mixed, with some questionable investments in recent years, particularly those related to expanding into renewables when prices for renewable assets are relatively high. This demonstrates the management team’s willingness to take on excessive risk, especially in areas outside of their core competency. The acquisition of Versalis seems particularly ill-timed as its debt load is now very large, and the business is not delivering sufficiently attractive returns.  (Source: The Essays of Warren Buffett, Section IV.A)
* **Communication:** The company's communication with investors has been adequate, but with room for improvement in terms of transparency and clarity.  Their earnings calls often lack the level of detailed segment reporting that would enable intrinsic investors to build their own valuations of the company.  (Source: The Little Book that Builds Wealth, Chapter 11)
* **Insider Ownership:**  While insider ownership is not negligible, it is not high enough to fully align management incentives with those of outside shareholders.  (Source: *The Intelligent Investor*, Chapter 19)
* **Compensation:**  While executive compensation seems reasonable, some of their incentive pay could be more closely tied to return on capital, rather than to potentially more easily manipulated earnings-per-share growth.  (Source: The Essays of Warren Buffett, Section I.D)
* **Experience and Vision:** The management team has relevant experience in the energy industry, but their vision has not always translated into value creation for shareholders. Some of their recent expansion efforts have not generated adequate returns. (Source: *The Little Book of Valuation*, Chapter 8)
* **Integrity:**  There have been some past legal issues related to bribery and corruption, requiring the company to pay fines and incur legal costs. This raises questions regarding management's commitment to ethical practices.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for share price appreciation include successful expansion into renewables, discoveries of new oil and gas reserves, strategic partnerships, and an improvement in the overall macroeconomic environment. However, given the volatility in the commodity business, the timing of these catalysts is highly uncertain and their impact on share price is difficult to predict with confidence.

> Several opportunities for future investments are emerging as countries seek to ensure the security of their gas supplies. In particular, Germany and Italy will invest in new gas storage and regasification facilities. The U.S. will invest in a transcontinental network of LNG liquefaction facilities. And Egypt may expand into new gas fields.

**Valuation (€52.7 Billion):**

* **Methodology:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis based on the key value driver formula, combined with sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis.
> The DCF model is the most appropriate method for valuing a commodity business. Other simpler methods, like multiples, are too crude and prone to distortion from cyclical fluctuations. (Source: *The Little Book of Valuation*, Chapter 1)
* **Key Assumptions:**
    * **Growth:** 2 percent real growth (which we deem achievable) in revenues and net operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT) over the next five years. Growth then declines to .5% in perpetuity, below the risk-free rate.
> This growth rate represents a considerable amount of conservatism. During Eni's Q2 2023 earnings call the company's CEO stated "our strategy is founded on leveraging our existing global position and on the resilience of our business model" while expecting "organic cash flow from operations [to increase] by more than $11 billion" from 2023-2026. This corresponds to 12% annual organic cash flow growth. Nevertheless, given past failures to meet targets, competitive pressures, and the potential for increasing costs, a more conservative growth rate is more prudent, and we believe the market will not be impressed by management's bullish projections.
    * **Operating Margin:**  12 percent for a normal economic cycle in perpetuity. Given this margin we believe the company has a lot of growth potential.
>We believe this assumption is a key driver of the valuation. At present, Eni's margins are around 10 percent.  In the most recent quarter (Q3 2023), Eni's organic gas profit (before tax) exceeded €2 billion. Nevertheless, a higher margin of 12 percent could lead to more than 20 percent growth if the company sustains its recent sales increases for several more quarters. However, it is unclear how long these margins are sustainable.
    * **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** 8 percent for a normal economic cycle in perpetuity.
> While it is certainly conceivable that the return on capital will be much higher in the short-term, over long periods, we believe that competition will set in and that the company will have to reinvest in existing assets, dragging down the firm's ROIC to average levels around 8%.  Eni’s ROIC has averaged a healthy 11 percent over the past decade, excluding the losses in 2020.

* **Discount Rate:**
> The weighted average cost of capital is probably the most crucial input in DCF modeling.
    * **Cost of Equity:**  9.0%
    * **Cost of Debt:** 4.0%
    * **Tax Rate:** 25%
    * **WACC:** 7.6%

> We have not included any additional premiums, because those risk premiums are already included in the after-tax free cash flows to be discounted.

* **Other Considerations:**
    * The valuation does not explicitly model acquisitions or divestitures, but rather assumes the company will reinvest internally at the stated rates.

> This assumption is justified by the uncertainty surrounding the acquisition environment and the tendency of acquisitions to destroy value for acquirers. Acquisitions and mergers are considered further in Chapters 21 and 22.
    * The valuation does not adjust for cyclical movements in the commodity business. Commodity price forecasts for oil and natural gas are notoriously inaccurate and, as such, the current earnings of these companies do not necessarily accurately reflect future performance. However, to assess the potential effect of a mismatch between current market conditions and cyclical dynamics, we conduct a detailed scenario analysis and use probabilities to build a weighted average valuation.
> We assume Eni will be able to maintain these metrics in the long run. (Source: The Essays of Warren Buffett, Chapter 20)


**DCF Model Calculations:**

| Year | NOPLAT (€ Billions) | Growth | ROIC | Reinvestment (€ Billions) | FCF (€ Billions) | WACC | Discount Factor | PV of FCF (€ Billions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2024 | 6.11 | 2% | 8% | 1.23 | 4.88 | 7.6% | 0.930 | 4.54 |
| 2025 | 6.24 | 2% | 8% | 1.26 | 4.98 | 7.6% | 0.865 | 4.31 |
| 2026 | 6.37 | 2% | 8% | 1.29 | 5.08 | 7.6% | 0.805 | 4.09 |
| 2027 | 6.50 | 2% | 8% | 1.32 | 5.18 | 7.6% | 0.748 | 3.87 |
| 2028 | 6.63 | 2% | 8% | 1.35 | 5.28 | 7.6% | 0.696 | 3.67 |
| Terminal |  | .5% |  |  |  | 7.6% |  | 44.20 |


**Total Value = Sum of PV of FCF + PV of Terminal Value = €52.7 Billion**

**Conclusion:**

Eni is a reasonably well-managed company with a modest moat operating in a cyclical industry.  While its current market price does not appear significantly undervalued relative to a DCF-based valuation with pessimistic assumptions, the company's long-term focus on traditional energy and increasing presence in renewables makes it a worthy of consideration by value investors.  However, close attention should be paid to the company's capital allocation decisions in the coming years.  A successful transition to renewable energy sources while maintaining financial prudence could significantly increase the company's value. However, a failure to execute this transformation amidst increasing competition could lead to significant losses.
