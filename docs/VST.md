Vistra Corp. operates in the integrated retail electricity business in Texas. While the retail electricity business can have high returns in certain circumstances, it is a fundamentally challenging industry with low barriers to entry and exit. This makes it difficult for companies to build a sustainable competitive advantage, or economic moat, as described in Pat Dorsey's book *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Vistra earns a 2/5 rating because while there are aspects that provide some temporary competitive advantages, there is little to suggest a sustainable and wide moat.

{: .highlight }
* **Switching Costs (Limited):**  There are some switching costs associated with changing retail electricity providers, mostly due to the hassle of setting up new accounts and potential disruptions in service.  However, these are not significant enough to create a strong moat, especially given the ease with which competitors can enter the market.  As Pat Dorsey mentions in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, these must be significant to be a source of a moat.
* **Regulation (Narrow):** In Texas, the retail electricity market is deregulated, but the broader energy market remains subject to significant regulation. While this can create temporary advantages for incumbents,  regulatory changes can quickly alter the dynamics of an industry and erode competitive advantages. As Michael Mauboussin notes in *Measuring Global Insights: Assessing the Magnitude and Sustainability of Value Creation*, regulatory changes can dramatically alter the industry landscape and regulations themselves are a barrier for newer entrants. 
* **Scale (Limited):** Vistra benefits from economies of scale due to its large size, particularly in purchasing power for electricity. However, as Mauboussin's report points out, the benefits of scale primarily play out at the regional or even local level, not at the state, national, or global level in most industries, and the retail electricity market in Texas is becoming increasingly competitive. Therefore, the advantage related to scale is likely to be limited, especially in the long term.
{: .important }
* **Lack of Intangible Assets:** Vistra does not have any significant intangible assets, such as strong brands or patents, that would create a competitive advantage.   Dorsey emphasizes intangible assets like brands, patents, or government licenses as long-lasting sources of moats.

**Management:**

Vistra's management earns a 2/5 rating.  There are various issues to be skeptical of, though the company seems to be reasonably managed.

* **Capital Allocation:**  Vistra has a history of engaging in acquisitions, some of which, according to management discussion in Q4 2021 earnings call, have been made at prices considerably above book value (e.g. Crius Energy Trust). This raises questions about management’s skill in making value-creating acquisitions, as highlighted in Warren Buffett's essays *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*. In the Q1 2023 earnings call, the management signaled continuing on a disciplined approach in regards to acquisitions. This seems like a positive development to be wary of.
* **Compensation:**  While I do not have detailed information on executive compensation, high payouts would be a negative as it comes at the expense of shareholder returns, especially given that management's skill has yet to be fully proven. This is similar to the concerns raised by Buffett regarding stock options, as discussed in his essays, which he believes can enrich managers at the expense of shareholders.
{: .note }
* **Communication:** In the Q3 2022 earnings call, management candidly discussed the impact of Winter Storm Uri on their financials and the measures undertaken to address it. This is a positive sign of transparency. However, given the overall opaque nature of the financial sector, and its inherent exposure to commodity cycles, more transparency regarding financial engineering and risk is necessary, as it helps outside investors assess risk, which is crucial in building confidence.   Management needs to ensure understanding and alignment with its investor base and to focus on intrinsic value.
* **Insider Ownership:** The absence of large insider ownership raises questions about management's long-term commitment to creating shareholder value. The Q3 2022 earnings call transcript mentions management & employees only having roughly 1.4% of stock, which is a negligible amount. As Michael Burry suggests in his journal and how he values company, this can be a warning sign to be wary of. 
* **Track Record:** While the company has been able to maintain decent earnings and revenue growth for the past decade, its returns on capital have dropped during the 2008 crisis and recently, primarily driven by its acquisitions, according to several discussions during earnings calls. This raises concerns about the sustainability of its profitability and management's ability to drive superior returns, especially considering how challenging it is to manage a business through the industry's ups and downs. 

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** Vistra's revenue primarily comes from its retail electricity sales in Texas. This revenue is largely dependent on fluctuations in electricity prices, making it vulnerable to commodity cycles, making the company cyclical.  
* **Margins:** Vistra’s margins are also subject to fluctuations in electricity prices. The company generally tries to maintain a stable margin, but can vary slightly from year to year.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The retail electricity market in Texas is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and exit. This makes it very challenging to maintain a sustainable, consistent margin, and to maintain a consistent return above the cost of capital, and to maintain a consistent and long-term rate of growth.
{: .warning }
* **Differentiation:** Vistra tries to differentiate itself through providing a user-friendly customer experience and offering various plans to its customers.  However, these differentiators are not very difficult for competitors to replicate.   Therefore, they are unlikely to generate a long-term competitive advantage, as Dorsey mentions in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* where real differentiators provide price premium or reduce costs.

**Financials:**

Vistra's financials reflect the volatile nature of the retail electricity business. The company has had revenue and earnings growth over the past decade, but its financial leverage, according to several quarterly reports, increased significantly after the 2007 acquisition, and it has not been able to generate returns well above its cost of capital. 


**Valuation:**

Valuation of Vistra is tricky due to the volatility of the commodity market in general and the retail electricity market in particular. To come up with a fair value estimate, we use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, employing methods used by Michael Burry, as described in *The Little Book of Valuation*.  

<callout>
Assumptions:
* **Revenue Growth:** 2% annual growth. This is justified given the challenging competitive landscape and increasingly saturated market, and considering the long-term historical real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the U.S. of roughly 2% (according to The World Bank).
* **Operating Margin:** 10%. This number is based on an average over the past decade, and adjusted slightly downward to reflect potential margin pressure from competition. 
* **Tax Rate:** 25% in the long term. This accounts for tax law changes and Texas regulations.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% . This higher cost of capital reflects the regulatory risks of the utility sector and the increasing number of competitors, suggesting market's risk-averse view, as Damodaran notes in his book and similar to the approach by Michael Burry who assigns relatively high cost of capital to account for the risk.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10%. 
* **Terminal Value:** We use a terminal value by assuming that cash flows will grow at a constant rate of 2 percent for the rest of the company's life.
* **Discounting:** We discount at the previously determined 9% cost of capital. 
</callout>

The resulting value for a business as usual case is **$8.13 billion** at the time of this analysis. This is well below the current market value.


**Catalysts:**

* **Acquisitions:**  Vistra could materially increase its value by making accretive acquisitions at reasonable prices, especially if accompanied by operational improvements, as discussed in *Valuation*. However, given management's prior track record on acquisitions, this is a risk to be pessimistic about. 
* **Market Share Gains:** If Vistra can gain market share in the increasingly competitive Texas electricity market, that would improve its profitability and valuation. As evidenced by the Morgan Stanley report *Measuring Global Insights: Assessing the Magnitude and Sustainability of Value Creation*, increasing market share can be a source of value creation. However, given the fragmented and commoditized nature of the market, this will be difficult.
* **Cost Cutting:**  If Vistra can effectively cut costs and enhance efficiency, its profitability and valuation would improve. However, as discussed in the intelligent investor, cost-cutting improvements are easier written on paper than in practice.
* **Favorable Regulation:**  Favorable regulatory changes could benefit Vistra. However, given the constantly evolving regulatory landscape and the political scrutiny surrounding the energy market,  this is not something to bank on. 
* **Vertical Integration:** Vistra could potentially benefit from vertically integrating into related businesses, such as power generation. This is particularly relevant given the company's recent focus on renewable energy projects (discussed in Q4 2022 earnings call) and its integrated business model, which could provide some synergies, though this will require substantial investments in acquisitions or internal development. As discussed in Mauboussin's report, vertical integration can be a strategic move to create more value.


Overall, Vistra earns a catalyst rating of 3/5. This reflects the potential upside from its renewable energy investments, market share gains, and cost-cutting efforts, though these come with risks related to execution and competition.
