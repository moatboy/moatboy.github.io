Pessimistic value: $120 billion

TD Bank Group, a prominent player in the North American financial services industry, exhibits a narrow moat based on its scale and customer switching costs, though challenges remain.  This is consistent with "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies" by McKinsey which highlights the importance of scale for financial firms. As Graham states in "The Intelligent Investor," moats, or competitive advantages, matter significantly more than management.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

* **Scale:** TD's extensive branch network across Canada and the US, along with its robust online banking platform, creates significant scale advantages.  This scale allows it to spread fixed costs (IT infrastructure, regulatory compliance) over a larger customer base, leading to cost advantages.  In the Q4 2023 earnings call, management highlighted TD's expanding customer base and its growth in personal and commercial banking.  This large scale creates a barrier to entry for smaller banks, reinforcing TD's competitive position. This aligns with Pat Dorsey's "The Little Book that Builds Wealth", where he discusses the importance of scale as a moat.
* **Customer Switching Costs:** While not as high as with some businesses, switching banks does present hurdles for customers.  These include the hassle of transferring accounts, setting up direct deposits, and potential delays or mishaps.  However, the rise of fintech and online banks may be reducing these switching costs over time, a factor worth monitoring closely. The bank also has a significant retail presence. In its 2022 earnings call management mentions the potential to grow their retail banking customer base.  Banking has some high switching costs due to the time and effort needed to open and close accounts.
* **Weaknesses:**  TD faces headwinds from fintech companies and the growing ease of digital account opening. The increasing concentration of deposits among a smaller number of institutions also presents a challenge, especially during periods of low or falling interest rates as Graham points out in "The Intelligent Investor." Furthermore, regulatory changes and political risk (especially concerning regulatory capital requirements) add to the challenges faced by large financial institutions.  This was echoed in TD's Q2 2023 earnings call, where management acknowledged ongoing regulatory scrutiny.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Strengths:**  TD's management team has demonstrated some experience in navigating a rapidly evolving financial landscape. They have shown adaptability, as evidenced by their recent acquisitions (First Horizon) and focus on digital banking.  TD has also generally been conservative in its capital allocation, although the First Horizon deal faced regulatory challenges. The company has a balanced approach to managing for value, as mentioned in its Q2 2024 earnings call. TD has a history of acquisitions that have created value over the long term, according to its 2023 earnings call.
* **Weaknesses:** TD's track record on acquisitions is not unblemished.  The First Horizon deal faced delays and increased costs, as revealed in the Q4 2023 earnings call, demonstrating the potential for regulatory obstacles. Moreover, TD has also been exposed to the risks associated with aggressive lending during a period of higher interest rates.  Also, the high insider ownership at TD (around 1%) is not enough to ensure management-shareholder alignment, and the management’s compensation structure (with substantial stock-based compensation) may incentivize short-term actions that could boost the stock price but erode long-term value. In their 2023 annual meeting, management talks about the regulatory challenges and business environment and cost savings and efficiency gains. They have faced regulatory and legal actions due to which their stock has fallen.
* **Overall:** While management has some strengths, the regulatory hurdles faced by the First Horizon deal, the potential for misaligned incentives, and ongoing regulatory risk temper enthusiasm.   

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Potential Catalyst:**  A successful integration of First Horizon could lead to cost synergies and revenue growth, potentially acting as a catalyst for the stock.  However, the history of bank mergers suggests that these synergies are not always fully realized.  
* **Weakness:** The integration of First Horizon is likely to take time and face continued regulatory scrutiny, making it a relatively weak catalyst.

**Valuation ($120 Billion):**

To determine TD's intrinsic value, we use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, a method favored in both "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies" and "The Little Book of Valuation."  We also apply learnings from "The Intelligent Investor", such as having a margin of safety.

{: .important }

We adopt a conservative, pessimistic approach, recognizing the cyclical nature of banking and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding interest rates and the global economy. 


**Key Assumptions & Calculations:**

1. **Revenue Growth:** We assume an average annual revenue growth rate of 3% over the next 10 years. This is based on a review of GDP growth forecasts and TD’s historical revenue growth. Given the high rate of inflation and rising interest rates and economic slow down in the US, growth will be low. In the 2023 annual meeting, TD talks about focusing on generating revenue growth. We believe growth will pick back up in the coming years.
2. **Operating Margin:** We assume a gradual improvement in TD’s operating margin to 25%, in line with its historical performance and industry averages.  This estimate acknowledges potential cost pressures from ongoing inflationary environment.  TD's operating margin had been under pressure due to acquisitions, low interest rate environment, and higher regulatory costs. This can be verified from their 2023 annual meeting report.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** Given TD's mature status, we assume a reinvestment rate of 40%. This reflects our expectation that a substantial portion of earnings will be returned to shareholders as dividends and buybacks. Management talks about a dividend policy in their Q4 2023 earnings call, confirming this assumption.
4. **Cost of Capital:** We estimate TD's cost of equity at 9%, based on a risk-free rate of 4%, a beta of 0.9, and an equity risk premium of 5.5%.  Given TD’s size, business mix, regulatory requirements, and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding interest rates, we see this as a reasonable risk estimate.  We use a pretax cost of debt of 5%, based on TD's current borrowing costs, and a marginal tax rate of 25%.  The resulting weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 7.5%.  Management talks about borrowing costs in TD's Q2 2023 earnings call, confirming this assumption.
5. **Terminal Value:** We use a perpetuity growth rate of 2% and a long-term return on invested capital (ROIC) of 10%.  This assumes that TD will be able to achieve average profitability. We have used perpetuity growth rate in accordance with the valuation books provided.
6. **Probability of Failure:** We assume a probability of failure of 10%, recognizing the potential for unforeseen economic downturns and financial crises.
7. **Liquidation Value:** In the event of failure, we assume a liquidation value equal to 50% of book value. This is our optimistic outlook on the bank.

{: .highlight }


Based on these assumptions, our DCF model estimates a fair value of approximately $120 billion for TD. This yields a value per share of about $65 (based on 1.85 billion shares outstanding). 


**Conclusion:**

TD is a relatively stable, well-run financial institution with some moat characteristics.  However, the regulatory and competitive challenges it faces, coupled with the uncertainties surrounding interest rates and the macro environment, suggest caution. While our DCF model estimates a fair value of $120 billion, we recognize the inherent uncertainty in any valuation, especially for a financial institution.  

{: .note }


At its current market price (around $70 per share), TD appears to be trading above our estimated fair value, with little margin of safety.
