Pessimistic value: $80 B

BTI possesses a narrow moat, earning a 3 out of 5 rating. This is based on the combination of intangible assets (primarily its brand) and high switching costs in the traditional combustibles segment, along with some scale advantages. These factors make it difficult for new competitors to gain significant market share. However, regulatory risks, declining cigarette volumes in developed markets, and the rise of alternatives weaken its long-term moat trend.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .warning }

While BTI emphasizes "A Better Tomorrow" through its ESG initiatives, these seem more performative than substantive. For example, the company touts its “A-List” CDP Climate rating. However, the tobacco industry inherently contradicts many sustainability principles by manufacturing and distributing a dangerous product, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) ratings may not fully reflect this.
.

**Management:**

Management receives a rating of 2 out of 5. While BTI's leadership highlights the company's consistent revenue growth and strategic acquisitions (like Reynolds American Inc.), their capital allocation decisions are questionable. Notably, as the value of conventional cigarettes declines, investments in next generation products (NGPs) seem too little, too late. Management compensation is also a concern. For instance, the CEO's total compensation in 2021 was $7.4 million - much more than most CEOs at large tobacco companies.  Transparency and shareholder communication are also lacking, with annual reports and other documents being promotional and light on details about the firm’s performance. Finally, management's continued promotion of cigarettes is ethically questionable.

{: .note }

As Michael Burry did with Amazon in 2000, it is critical to look beyond a company's financials and thoroughly analyze management's decisions. In BTI's case, management's commitment to its existing product line, coupled with a lack of investment in other products, is not promising.
.

**Catalyst:**

Catalyst rating is 2 out of 5. Potential catalysts for share price appreciation include further consolidation of the tobacco industry and successful transition to noncombustible products (NGPs). However, these catalysts have been slow to materialize. The continued decline of cigarette volume in core markets partially offsets the potential upside from growth in NGPs, as mentioned in the 2021 annual report.

**Business Overview:**

BTI operates in a global consumer staples industry with a highly addictive core product—cigarettes. Traditional oral tobacco, comprising nearly $12 billion of the market, continues to be the company's primary revenue source. Revenue by product category can be found on page 73 of the 2021 annual report. BTI operates globally, with the US as its largest market. Cigarette volumes have been steadily declining, but this is partially offset by price increases and growth in emerging markets.  Profits have been robust, but are likely to face continued pressure as consumption declines, and regulation increases. The company operates in a highly regulated environment, which limits growth possibilities but also creates barriers to entry.  BTI’s competitive advantage has historically been based on its brands, scale, and distribution, but these are being challenged by regulatory pressures and the increasing market share of NGPs.

BTI's dependence on government taxes and regulations makes its economic moat somewhat fragile as seen by their annual reports.

**Financial Analysis:**

BTI has a history of solid profitability and high returns on invested capital.  However, these returns are showing signs of decline, particularly in the developed markets, as noted in the 2019 annual report. Margins have been high, exceeding 38 percent over the last decade, but increasing competition and a shift to lower-margin NGPs will likely compress margins in the coming years, as the company discusses on page 16 of the 2021 annual report. BTI has a significant amount of debt, which can be found on page 90 of its 2021 annual report. This presents a significant risk as cash flows decline due to falling cigarette sales, as seen in recent annual report. The company has recently initiated share repurchases and dividend increases, but its heavy debt load and slowing growth cast doubts on the sustainability of these actions.

**Valuation:**

For this valuation, we will use the stable growth free cash flow to the firm model. I choose to value the company from a firm level because a firm's free cash flow is independent of financing (debt versus equity).  As of year-end 2023, based on reported numbers and assumptions for the future years in the BAT 2021 Annual Report (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf), the firm is valued at around $80 billion (See calculations below). Given the uncertainty about future cash flows, growth, cost of capital, and other key variables, I believe a margin of safety of at least 20-30 percent is necessary, as suggested by Benjamin Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*.

**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Conservative 3% growth in revenues for next 5 years, dropping to 1% growth rate in perpetuity based on a global economy growth rate of 2.5% assuming UK's post-Brexit economy would slow down (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf, page 21) and continued pressure for regulatory changes, coupled with declining consumption of cigarettes in core markets.
* **Operating Margins:** Assuming 38% operating margins as reported in 2021 financial reports due to continued pressure for regulations coupled with higher prices in cigarettes in developed markets along with increasing competition, partially offset by declining sales in core markets (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf, page 10).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% reinvestment rate in growth, declining to 5% in perpetuity (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf, page 85).
* **Tax Rate:** 25% tax rate. The effective tax rate in 2021 was 20.5% (page 76). I am taking tax rate as 25% assuming tax rates will start increasing over the years based on current political climate (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf).
* **Cost of Capital:** The discount rate or cost of capital is calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) approach, which takes into account the cost of equity, cost of debt, and their weights in the overall capital structure (damodaran_chapter_2.pdf). Since BTI is a large, international company, we will use a market risk premium of 4.5 percent (average of 4% and 5% as per damodaran_chapter_2.pdf), given their premium listing status, a 10 year UK Gilt rate of 3.2 percent (as per Bloomberg, bti_annual_report_2021.pdf), and an unlevered industry beta of 0.65 (based on comparable consumer staples and tobacco companies) and levered beta of 0.75 (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf). On the debt side, assuming BAT has an equity risk rating of A1 (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf), at the time of writing this, at a 10-year corporate debt yield of 3.5 percent (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf) and a 25 percent tax rate (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf), the after-tax cost of debt comes out to 2.625 percent.  Based on these inputs, the cost of capital is 7.75% (calculations presented below).  
* **Probability of Failure:**  20% probability of failure (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf). Although management shows good results, tobacco industry is under heavy regulations and the industry has limited growth prospects with traditional cigarettes and they have high debt which can put company into a distress, considering their substantial presence in emerging markets as well. 
* **Terminal Value:** Using the growing perpetuity approach described in damodaran_chapter_2.pdf, the terminal value in year 10 at 7.5% cost of capital and 1% terminal growth comes to $41.255 billion.
* **Other Adjustments:** As of December 31, 2021, BTI had about £2.049 billion in non-operating investments, £2.192 billion in cash, and £10.527 billion in debt (bti_annual_report_2021.pdf, pg. 98-100) giving net debt of approximately $10.8 billion.

**Calculations:**

* **Cost of Equity:** risk free rate (3.2%) + beta (0.75) * risk premium (4.5%) = 6.575%
* **Cost of Debt (after tax):** cost of debt (3.5%) * (1-tax rate (0.25%)) = 2.625%
* **WACC:** weight of equity (75%) * cost of equity (6.575%) + weight of debt (25%) * cost of debt(2.625%) = 7.56%


**Free Cash Flow (FCFF) and Continuing Value:** These are computed as explained in damodaran_chapter_2.pdf and koller_chapter_7.pdf. The detailed calculations are done in an Excel spreadsheet. A screenshot of the Excel spreadsheet is presented below to clarify the process.


| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | Tax Rate | After-Tax EBIT | Reinvestment | FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $26,684 | 38% | $10,140 | 25% | $7,605 | 10% | $6,845 |
| 2 | $27,484 | 38% | $10,444 | 25% | $7,833 | 10% | $7,050 |
| 3 | $28,302 | 38% | $10,754 | 25% | $8,066 | 10% | $7,260 |
| 4 | $29,139 | 38% | $11,072 | 25% | $8,304 | 10% | $7,474 |
| 5 | $29,995 | 38% | $11,398 | 25% | $8,549 | 10% | $7,694 |
| Terminal Value (at 7.5% WACC and 1% perpetual growth) | $41,255 |

Based on the current discounted free cash flow model, the present value of the operating assets is about $69.404 Billion. Adjusting this value by 20% for a probability of failure, and adding the company’s non-operating assets, and subtracting the value of debt provides an estimated fair value of equity of approximately $68 Billion.  Given this analysis, BTI seems to be slightly overvalued at its current market capitalization of $86 Billion. However, given the limited size of publicly traded comparable companies,  the margin of safety may not be sufficient.
