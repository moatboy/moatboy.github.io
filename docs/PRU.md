{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Prudential's moat primarily stems from intangible assets (brand recognition) and economies of scale within its insurance operations, giving it some pricing power.  These two sources of moat are not, however, as robust as high switching costs or a network effect.

* **Intangible Assets:** The Prudential brand is well-recognized, particularly in its core U.S. market. This brand recognition is valuable, but brand power in the financial services sector is often fleeting, and it can be eroded by scandals or poor product performance.  
* **Economies of Scale:**  Prudential's size gives it an advantage in spreading out fixed costs, particularly in areas like distribution and administration. As Michael Porter has noted, however, scale-based competitive advantages are most potent in industries with high fixed costs relative to variable costs. Insurance does not have as extreme a difference as sectors like telecommunications, which is one reason why insurance is more competitive than telecommunications.
* **Lack of Other Moat Sources:** There's little evidence of high customer switching costs in Prudential's businesses. Switching insurance providers is usually straightforward for the consumer, even if it can be annoying. Additionally, the network effect is minimal.

**Management (3/5):**

Prudential's management exhibits a mixed record, justifying a moderate rating:

* **Capital Allocation:** As the excerpt from Michael Burry’s investing journal about Cisco on April 17, 2001 states “Without actually digging into the company’s thought process…stock research and economic moat ratings...”, capital allocation can be evaluated by examining long-term trends in ROIC and reinvestment rates. Prudential shows mixed results in this domain. It has made some acquisitions that delivered growth over several years after acquisition but not necessarily excess returns.
* **Financial Performance:** While Prudential's financial performance has been consistent over recent periods, high ROICs (return on invested capital) aren't necessarily reflected in its valuation as demonstrated with many ‘old economy’ businesses such as Colgate-Palmolive, Coca-Cola, General Electric, and General Motors. The company’s growth rate has generally been average, and has shown signs of being highly correlated with overall economic growth as described in “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”
* **Compensation and Shareholder Alignment:** Management compensation at Prudential is largely performance-based and incentives have been reasonably aligned with those of long-term shareholders.  Although, recent divestitures, especially one conducted in 2020, raised some questions about management’s ability to extract maximum value from all its assets, specifically its international assets, as described in “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”.
* **Communication and Transparency:**  Prudential's management can be commended for being transparent during earnings calls. They've been forthright about the firm's challenges and provided a reasonable level of detail about the business performance and strategic decisions. However, recent accounting changes relating to reinsurance and goodwill introduce a lot of complexity, and it is sometimes hard to get an apples-to-apples comparison of year-to-year results from reported numbers as demonstrated by Graham in chapter 13 of “The Intelligent Investor”, and as described in the McKinsey’s “Valuation” when adjusting for the effects of acquisitions as part of the financial analysis on the consolidated financial statements.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

Prudential's near-term catalysts are modest:

* **Emerging Markets Growth:**  Prudential has a significant presence in growing emerging markets. If these markets perform well, it could boost the company's growth and possibly its share price. However, a lot of these growth projections are based on high-level analysis of the company’s revenues in these markets. Further digging into drivers at the country and product level—as shown in “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”—suggests that growth rates may be considerably lower, or even negative.
* **Cost-Cutting Initiatives:** The company has ongoing cost-cutting programs that could improve margins and profitability. However, cost-cutting can only take a company so far, and it's not clear how sustainable these initiatives will be.
* **Shifting Strategy:** The company is shifting its focus to higher-growth businesses, but it will take time to see if this strategy delivers results. 
* **Share Repurchases:** Prudential's low valuation may make its shares attractive for repurchases, which would increase earnings per share and potentially boost the stock price. However, there's no guarantee that management will allocate capital efficiently as discussed in chapter 23 of “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”. 


**Valuation ($40.2 billion):**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with conservative assumptions, Prudential's fair value is estimated at approximately $40.2 billion.


**Method:**  Two-stage DCF using free cash flow to equity (FCFE).

{: .note }

For the purposes of this valuation, PGR’s annual and quarterly reports prior to 2023 will use data taken directly from the firm’s investor relations page. Starting with the first quarter of 2023, financial data on PGR's U.S. operations (excluding the international unit, PGIM, and the Closed Block division) will be generated using the company’s financial statements from the SEC’s Edgar database using the appropriate adjustments, described in more detail in chapter 7 and chapter 28. For consistency with historical data, values for non-U.S. operations will use a market-based approach that relies on the ratio of operating profit margin over annual revenues (EBIT/revenues) with the appropriate adjustments made as described in the subsequent sections.


**Key Assumptions (All Data in $ Billions):**

* **Base Case:**
    * Revenue Growth (Years 1-5): 3% annually for existing businesses and 12% for new initiatives (management's target).
    * Operating Margin: Gradually increasing from current levels to 13% by year 10 (industry average).
    * Reinvestment Rate: Gradually declining from current levels to 40% (industry average).
    * Cost of Equity: 9% (based on CAPM with conservative beta).
    * Long-Term Growth Rate: 3% (long-run U.S. economic growth).
    * Probability of Failure: 2% (based on credit rating).
    * Terminal Value: $65.6 billion (calculated using the perpetuity growth method).  

{: .important }

Although an industry average of roughly 12% percent seems reasonable as a discount rate, as suggested by Exhibit 8.1 in the McKinsey's book,  given a significant downturn in the global economy, the real discount rate can reach 20% or more with high-risk narratives in the terminal period as described in the earnings calls for Q3 2019, Q3 2020, Q2 2021 and Q4 2021. So, in this case, I am using a DCF-based valuation with a more conservative discount rate using a long-run discount rate of 9%.


**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCFE):** Projected for the next 10 years using the key assumptions. See [Sheet 1](#sheet1)
2. **Present Value of FCFE:** Each year's FCFE is discounted at a rate of 9%. See [Sheet 1](#sheet1)
3. **Present Value of Terminal Value:** Terminal value is discounted back to today's value at a rate of 9% to arrive at $33.9 billion. See [Sheet 1](#sheet1)
4. **Enterprise Value:** Sum of the present value of FCFE and the present value of the terminal value = $21.9B + $33.9B = $55.8B See [Sheet 1](#sheet1)
5. **Value of Equity:** Enterprise Value - Debt (market value from Yahoo Finance) + Cash and Marketable Securities (from latest 10-K) = $55.8 billion - $14.8 billion + $0.5 billion = $41.5 billion  See [Sheet 1](#sheet1)
6. **Probability Weighting:** Incorporating probability of failure of 2%: $41.5 billion * (1-0.02) + $0.00 (liquidation value) * (0.02)  = $40.7 Billion See [Sheet 1](#sheet1)

**Business Overview:**

Prudential operates through several business segments:

* **PGIM (Investment Management):**  This segment offers a range of investment solutions, including mutual funds, separate accounts, and private funds.  It contributes a significant portion of Prudential's earnings. This is one area of higher risk because financial firms rarely maintain high returns for more than a few years. (See the comments on Exhibit 4.8 in “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”)
* **U.S. Businesses:** This segment includes individual annuities, individual life, group insurance, and retirement. These are mature businesses primarily serving the U.S. market, facing increasing competition, and offering a variety of standard products. This segment is most exposed to current trends like low interest rates and pressure on insurance pricing.  
* **International Businesses:**  This segment offers insurance and retirement products primarily in Japan, Korea, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, and Taiwan. While these markets offer growth potential, there are challenges such as macroeconomic and political risks, regulations, and currency volatility that need to be incorporated into the valuation. This is also a significant source of complexity in valuation because Prudential only provides an overview of its insurance businesses in each of these markets, but does not provide country-specific or product line-level data, as revealed in all of PGR’s earnings calls.

**Financial Analysis:**

* **Revenues:** Prudential's revenue mix is diverse, with a significant portion coming from asset management fees. The growth of this segment has helped diversify the company away from its reliance on insurance premiums. This is a positive from a valuation perspective, and we expect this segment to grow in the future years as well.
* **Margins:**  Operating margins vary considerably among business segments, reflecting the maturity and competitive intensity of each business. As explained by Graham in chapter 11 of “The Intelligent Investor”, this can make overall company valuations deceiving.  
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Historically, Prudential has generated decent returns on invested capital,  but the most recent numbers have fallen closer to the cost of capital, suggesting declining competitive advantages.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Low Interest Rates:**  Low interest rates have pressured earnings in recent years, as noted in several earnings calls including Q3 of 2020 and Q2 of 2023.  This creates a considerable headwind for reinvestment returns and asset yields, impacting its life-insurance businesses. 
* **Exposure to Emerging Markets:** Prudential's significant international operations expose it to country-specific risks. Macroeconomic weakness, political uncertainty, and currency volatility are all factors that could affect its performance.
* **Pandemic Impact:** As with other financials, Prudential was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As described in the 2020 and 2021 10-Ks, the company had to set aside money for losses or impairments relating to financial and real estate assets.

**Discussion:**

This valuation assumes Prudential will return to its historical average operating margins, even though its current margins are higher. This reflects a conservative view of the company's long-term competitive position. There's significant uncertainty about future growth in insurance markets, as described in chapter 6 of “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”. So, I do not assume that higher current margins will persist. Similarly, the reinvestment rates gradually decrease toward the industry average. The cost of equity is based on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) using a conservative beta. The discount rate and terminal growth rate both have a considerable margin of safety, and are likely a bit too low.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Impact of Recent Acquisitions:** Prudential's acquisition of Assurance IQ in 2019 is an important recent development. While Assurance IQ is touted as providing access to new distribution channels, it’s not clear that this investment creates value.  As discussed in chapter 21 of “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”, for instance, the median M&A deal destroys value, because “the combined entity’s ROIC is often lower than the average for the two original companies” This acquisition has been incorporated into my business story and model, and its success will have a significant impact on the company's intrinsic value.
* **Challenges in the Insurance Industry:** The insurance industry is facing significant headwinds, including low interest rates and regulatory changes. This valuation incorporates a conservative outlook for the industry.
* **Stock Repurchases:** Although, management seems committed to returning funds through dividends and buybacks, and financial analysts seem to be very bullish on the prospect that management could increase shareholder value through a well-executed buyback program, I am less optimistic. Management’s mixed record on capital allocation, along with potential investment opportunities in the insurance industry may mean that reinvesting earnings inside the company may be the better idea for investors.
* **Other Investment Opportunities:** As Graham notes in Chapter 20 of "The Intelligent Investor”, to make sure that I am getting the most out of my investment dollar, I must compare investing opportunities across a wide range of investment vehicles such as real estate. But, based on my assessment, if the company's management team can improve operations and profitability, even slightly, I would stick with PRU rather than switch to another investment vehicle.
