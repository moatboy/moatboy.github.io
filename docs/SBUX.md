Moat: 3/5

Pessimistic value: $107 B

Starbucks' moat stems primarily from its **brand name** and **switching costs**, creating customer captivity, and **economies of scale**, specifically related to distribution.  These factors, though weakening, still provide an edge, especially in the more mature markets where the company has achieved significant penetration.  As per the The Little Book That Builds Wealth, brands can create a moat only if they can charge a price premium. Starbucks has historically been able to charge more for its coffee than its peers, but the recent rise in premium coffee shops and at-home coffee consumption poses a threat to its pricing power and, by extension, the sustainability of its brand-based moat. Also, although intangible assets can be durable competitive advantages, they can sometimes be fleeting, as seen in the case of Kodak.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


> From Q4 2020 earnings call: *"...the strength of our brand is as strong as ever...And we have pricing power..."*

Switching costs arise from Starbucks' tight integration with customer routines.  People tend to develop a habit for Starbucks' beverages and convenience,  as explained in Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. However, the ease with which competitors can replicate the basic product offerings, and the rise in at-home coffee consumption as a result of inflation and the COVID pandemic pose a challenge to its switching costs.

> From Q3 2021 earnings call: "...loyalty is incredibly strong as evidenced by record 90-day active rewards member growth."

Finally, Starbucks' size gives it some economies of scale, predominantly on the distribution side, making it tougher for small independent companies to compete as highlighted in Valuation. However, mature companies often suffer from declining growth, a real problem for Starbucks, according to The Little Book of Valuation. And its scale is primarily national, limiting its ability to achieve global scale.


**Management Rating Justification**

Starbucks' management receives a rating of 2 out of 5, primarily because of concerns over their **capital allocation** decisions and history of **overestimating growth**.  While Howard Schultz has made the same investment mistake of placing an oversized bet on his own company twice - first in the 1980's and then again in the 2000's, which is a sign of overconfidence - he is capable of being brutally honest and understands the business.

> From Q2 2000 earnings call: "...Obviously, I am an investor...However, with Starbucks, my passion probably transcends my objectivity..."

Their **expense tracking** could be improved, particularly relating to marketing costs. As seen in the earnings calls from the last few years, the company's executives have had difficulty managing expenses as it scales. This resonates with the struggles discussed in the book Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, wherein cost cutting and increasing efficiency rarely go as expected.


> From Q1 2023 earnings call: "...Our goal now is to get back to more moderate expense growth...But we are spending too much time managing costs in the near-term..."


Their **compensation** appears excessive relative to performance and their **share repurchase program** is a concern as it could have negative consequences during times of distress, as seen in the case of the 2008 Financial Crisis. Furthermore, although management claims that their **communication** with shareholders is transparent, as per Aswath Damodaran's Valuation, often such claims are used as a marketing tactic and do not reflect reality.

> From Q3 2021 earnings call: "We believe that we offer a particularly good environment for our owners…We also expect to increasingly measure their performance... We do so in a manner that they may more fully appreciate."

**Valuation**

The valuation uses a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, as recommended in Valuation by McKinsey & Company, for its flexibility and ability to incorporate uncertainty.  A 10-year explicit forecast period is used, with the terminal value representing the value of Starbucks into perpetuity. Due to the company's size and global presence, it seems reasonable to value it as a going concern.  A pessimistic view is taken, incorporating downward pressures on margins, increasing reinvestment, and a 6% growth rate in perpetuity.  The cost of equity is 8.3% (risk-free rate of 3.8%, beta of 0.75, and equity risk premium of 6%), while the cost of debt is 4% (based on a synthetic bond rating of A).  The company's target capital structure is 15% debt and 85% equity, a shift toward lower debt than historically maintained, given its cash build-up and more conservative strategy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The tax rate is 25%.  

{: .highlight }

**Calculations:**

1.  **Estimate free cash flow (FCF) for the next 10 years.** Project revenue based on 3% growth, and operating margin declining to 15%.  Estimate taxes using company's effective tax rate and forecast reinvestment using the sales-to-capital ratio.  FCF = Operating Income*(1-t) - Reinvestment
2.  **Calculate the terminal value.** This assumes a 6% perpetual growth rate, lower than the current global GDP growth rate.  Terminal value = FCF<sub>11</sub> / (Cost of capital – Growth rate)
3.  **Discount cash flows to present.** Discount both the explicit FCFs and the terminal value to present using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  WACC = (Cost of equity * % equity) + (After-tax cost of debt * % debt)
4.  **Add nonoperating assets.**  Valued at a conservative estimate of their book value.
5.  **Subtract debt and minority interests.**  Valued at their book value.
6.  **Divide by the number of shares outstanding.** This yields the estimated value per share.

{: .warning }

These calculations, based on the above assumptions and the financials provided, yield a present value of **$107 billion**.  This is significantly lower than the current market capitalization.

**Business and Financial Analysis**

Starbucks operates in a global market that is relatively mature and concentrated, with a few major players dominating market share.  As per Porter's Five Forces framework, the mature life cycle of the industry leads to increased rivalry, as discussed in Valuation. Increased competition puts pressure on Starbucks to maintain its margins and seek new growth opportunities which it attempts to achieve through new product development, international expansion (particularly in China), digital innovation, store remodeling and higher prices, as seen in its quarterly reports. However, with intense competition for market share, the market does seem to be quite efficient. Consequently, the value of new product development, digital innovation and global expansion will be limited.

> From Q3 2022 earnings call: "...We are in the early innings of the growth cycle..."

Starbucks' success stems from its ability to brand commodity coffee and deliver a premium experience to consumers. The company has a diversified product line, offering various beverages, food items, and merchandise. Its financials have been historically strong. However, revenue growth has been declining recently from 9% organic growth in 2019 to less than 2% in 2023.  The company's ROIC has exceeded its WACC, which according to Valuation is essential for maximizing firm value, but there are signs of decline as growth slows and competition intensifies.


> From Q1 2023 earnings call: "...We are seeing a slight softening in U.S. traffic trends..."


**Potential Catalysts and Rating**

Several potential catalysts could improve Starbucks' valuation. These include:

*   **Successful implementation of its Reinvention Plan:** This plan aims to improve the customer experience, drive productivity, and expand the store portfolio while preserving profit margin, which is key for shareholder value according to Valuation. The success of this plan needs careful monitoring. The company plans to invest heavily in equipment, potentially creating a financial strain.

> From Q2 2024 earnings call: “Our Reinvention plan is designed to improve store revenue growth through improved throughput, store profitability through productivity improvements, and new store growth through store development…”

*   **Continued growth in China:** The Chinese market, although troubled by lower traffic because of COVID, still has massive potential and could become a key driver of growth for Starbucks in the long term. As the Chinese market reopens, this catalyst becomes stronger.

> From Q3 2021 earnings call: "...China remains a long-term growth driver for the company..."

*   **Further expansion in other markets:** Emerging markets may provide substantial opportunities but they are very volatile, as discussed in Valuation.

> From Q2 2000 earnings call: "...We are looking at these markets over an extended period... and that is not necessarily the appropriate horizon for many of our customers..."


Given the uncertainty surrounding these catalysts and the current macroeconomic environment, Starbucks is assigned a **catalyst rating of 2 out of 5**.  There is significant upside potential, but the risks are equally significant.
