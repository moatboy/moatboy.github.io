# Starbucks
{: .fs-9 }

{: .label .label-purple }

Moat: 3/5

{: .label .label-yellow }

Pessimistic value: $97 B

Starbucks, a globally recognized coffeehouse chain, operates primarily in the U.S. (64%), followed by China (17%), and other international markets (19%). The company derives its revenue primarily from company-operated stores (85%), and licensed stores account for the remaining portion. Starbucks is clearly a successful and recognizable brand, and it has dominated the U.S. specialty-coffee market for more than a generation. However, recent financials show that it is facing headwinds. Its growth rate is not what it used to be, and although its revenues are substantial, so is its net debt and its return on invested capital (ROIC) is under pressure.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

{: .warning }
* **Revenues:** Starbucks' revenues have grown steadily, though growth has slowed in recent years. The company has reached near-market saturation in the U.S., and its Chinese market, while substantial, is slowing and facing increasing competition.  Revenue growth was 13% in 2019 and approximately 3% in 2020 and 2021. The annual growth rate was 17% between 2020 and 2023.

* **Margins:** Starbucks has historically boasted relatively robust operating margins, though these have been under pressure recently as the company pours money into store refurbishment and expansion, particularly in China. 

{: .important }
* **Industry Trends:** The global coffeehouse industry is growing, driven by increasing demand for specialty coffee and the convenience offered by large chains. However, competition is intensifying, with both large established players and smaller, independent coffeehouses vying for market share.

{: .note }
* **Capital Allocation:** Starbucks has been using its cash to repurchase shares and pay dividends. Its reinvestment rate has decreased significantly in recent years, and it has accumulated a large net debt burden. For Starbucks, which derives much of its value from its brand name, buying back shares may not be the wisest move.


**Moat Analysis:**

Starbucks' moat rests primarily on its **brand**, which provides a combination of predictable quality, status, and convenience. While other intangible sources of a moat, such as patents, are fleeting, brands can last much longer.  

{: .important }
However, a brand is only as good as the products it's attached to, and there is no pricing power if people aren't willing to pay more for the coffee, food, and related experiences it provides. While Starbucks has managed to maintain high prices for so long, questions about the continuing power of its brand will only intensify as competition intensifies.

Starbucks has some **cost advantages** given its substantial size and buying power. But such advantages are easily replicated by large competitors, and even small players can use licensing or bulk buying arrangements to gain access to lower costs. 

{: .note }
Starbucks benefits from **network effects** at a local rather than national or global level. Local presence confers local market power. If you are new to an area where only one Starbucks exists, they are your default provider, and they can extract economic rent until competitors set up shop.

{: .important }
The durability of Starbucks' brand, and thus the durability of its moat, is questionable. There is evidence that its moat is narrowing as competition intensifies. This fact explains its current price.

Therefore, taking all factors into consideration, Starbucks' moat receives a **3 out of 5 rating.** This rating reflects a strong but possibly weakening brand, limited cost advantages, local network effects, and increasing competition.

**Valuation:**

To arrive at a valuation for Starbucks, we employed a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, specifically an enterprise DCF. This approach is considered the most robust for valuing companies with complex financial structures, enabling the separation of operating and financial assets.

**Key Assumptions and Calculations (as of FY2023):**

<br>

1. **Revenues:** We projected annual revenue growth of 5% for the next five years (2024-2028), reflecting the challenges Starbucks faces in maintaining rapid growth in its mature markets and the intensifying competition in China. Revenue growth is then forecast to gradually decline to 3.5% by 2032. After year 10, we assume a terminal growth rate of 3%, in line with nominal long-run GDP growth. All growth rates are in nominal U.S. dollars.

{: .note }
2. **Operating Margin:** We assume an operating margin of 14% for the next 10 years, based on Starbucks' current margin and recent trends, which have been under pressure. In the continuing-value period, we project a long-term operating margin of 12%, which is slightly below its pre-Covid levels.

3. **Reinvestment:** We project an annual reinvestment rate of 10% for the next 10 years, declining thereafter in the terminal period. Starbucks' reinvestment rate, as measured using the change in invested capital to the change in sales, has averaged about 10% since 2019. This relatively high reinvestment rate is critical for Starbucks to refresh existing stores, open new stores in China and other emerging markets, and develop new products and services.

{: .note }
4. **Cost of Capital:** We calculated a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%, using the market values of Starbucks’ debt and equity (as reported on the company’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2023), a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate as our risk-free rate, and unlevered and relevering the company's beta using the MSCI World Index.

5. **Tax Rate:** We assumed a marginal tax rate of 25% for the next five years, converging to 24.24% (based on the tax rate in 2023). 

<br>

**Valuation Results:**

{: .highlight }
Based on these assumptions and forecasts, our DCF model generates an enterprise value of approximately **$112.6 Billion**. Netting out cash of $2.9 billion, minority interests of $0.1 billion, and nonoperating assets of $3.1 billion, and subtracting net debt of $15.8 billion (as of September 30, 2023), gives us a value for the equity of approximately **$97 billion.**

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

The DCF valuation was subject to sensitivity analysis, with the largest driver being the long-term ROIC. Given Starbucks' declining ROIC and increasing competition, we view a lower ROIC to be a more realistic representation of its future performance.
