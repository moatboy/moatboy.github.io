{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat - 2/5:**

{: .warning }
Kellogg's primary source of competitive advantage is its brand name, built over decades of operation. However, brands are unreliable moats, as consumers can easily switch between cereal brands.   This is particularly true in the packaged foods sector, where pricing and promotional activity are key drivers of market share. Switching costs are minimal, as any cost improvements the company makes are quickly passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. This increases competitive intensity and makes it more difficult to build a sustainable competitive advantage. As Pat Dorsey emphasizes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, "If a company can charge more than its peers \[...], that brand likely constitutes a formidable economic moat".  Kellogg's, unfortunately, struggles to charge a premium for its products in most product categories.


**Management - 2/5:**

While Kellogg's management team has a long history in the food industry, several factors lead to a lower rating:

{: .important }
* **Capital allocation decisions:** Kellogg's has a mixed record in acquisitions and divestitures. While the spin-off of WK Kellogg in late 2023 may unlock value (as spin-offs often do), the company's history with acquisitions has been less successful, often involving premium prices that destroy value.   In the fourth quarter of 2022 earnings call, management expressed optimism about the RXBAR acquisition but its long-term success remains to be seen.
* **Financial Engineering:** The company frequently uses debt for share repurchases, which can be a precarious financial engineering tactic in a cyclical business.
* **Executive Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to the company's annual total return to shareholders (TRS).  As discussed in *Valuation*, TRS is a flawed metric for incentivizing value creation as it can be heavily influenced by the market's mood swings. Management is also given stock options, which may incentivize short-term gains at the expense of long-term value creation.
{: .warning }
* **Dividend Policy:** Kellogg's has increased dividends in almost every year for the past four decades.  While the dividend may be viewed favorably by some shareholders, this commitment can reduce financial flexibility to invest in growth or weather cyclical downturns. Moreover, a long term declining operating income has led to a payout ratio near 100%, which is a severe sign of financial distress for a mature company.
* **Communication & Transparency:**  While Kellogg's provides detailed financial reports, their investor communications could be more focused on long-term value creation and less on short-term results.Â 


**Business:**

Kellogg's operates in a mature, competitive packaged foods industry.  

* **Revenue Distribution:** Kellogg's derives its revenue from four geographic regions: North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia Middle East Africa (AMEA). North America contributes the majority of total revenue.
* **Industry Trends:** The packaged foods industry is experiencing several trends: shifting consumer preferences (towards healthier, organic, plant-based products); increasing private-label penetration; and heightened competition from smaller players. These trends continue to put pressure on Kellogg's revenue growth and margins. 
{: .important }
* **Margins:** Kellogg's gross margins are decent but below the industry average. The company's operating margins are also below average, reflecting intense competition and its inability to charge premium prices.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The competitive landscape is fierce, dominated by a few large players (PepsiCo, General Mills, Mondelez, and Post) battling for market share through pricing and promotional activities. Private labels are also gaining traction. 

**Financials (in-depth):**

Kellogg's has seen slow revenue growth over the past few years, with a decline in net income.

* **Revenue:** The company's organic revenue growth has been anemic, largely driven by price increases rather than volume growth. Acquisitions and divestitures have masked this fundamental weakness. Notably, in the first quarter of 2023 earnings call, management admitted to struggling with sales and inventory problems in its plant-based meat business, Morningstar Farms, while the overall food industry faces recessionary and cyclical headwinds.
* **Margins:** Operating income has been declining, putting further pressure on already thin margins. As noted before, this indicates a narrow moat and a challenging pricing environment.
* **Cash Flow:** Free cash flow has been declining as well. The company's cash conversion cycle has deteriorated, leading to increased working capital needs.


**Valuation - $24.5 Billion:**

{: .highlight }
To value Kellogg's, a three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used.   Given the company's mature status, a declining ROIC and the current uncertain macro outlook, a pessimistic set of assumptions are used.

* **Stage 1 (Years 1-5):** Revenue growth of 1%, with operating margins improving to 15%.  Reinvested capital is projected at 50% of NOPLAT.

* **Stage 2 (Years 6-10):** Revenue growth of 0%, with operating margins remaining at 15%. Reinvested capital is projected at 40% of NOPLAT.

* **Stage 3 (Terminal Value):** Stable growth of -1%, with a return on capital of 10% (equal to cost of capital) and reinvestment rate of 31%. 

* **Cost of Capital:** WACC of 7.56%.  This is a slight premium to my estimate from a year earlier reflecting the rising interest rates and greater uncertainty associated with the global economic outlook.


**Other Relevant Considerations:**

* **Recent Issues:**  Kellogg's has been dealing with manufacturing problems, specifically a listeria outbreak affecting Honey Smacks cereal in 2018. In the company's annual report for 2018, it provides details about how it responded to this crisis, including working with health officials and issuing a recall of affected products.
* **Activist Pressure:**  In early 2019, activist investor Carl Icahn took a stake in Kellogg's and pushed for a breakup of the company.  Management has resisted this pressure so far, but it remains a potential catalyst for change.

**Catalyst - 1/5:**

There are no significant upcoming catalysts that are likely to substantially boost the share price in the near term. The planned spin-offs have already been completed, and the company's organic growth prospects remain muted.  The possibility of additional activist pressure remains, but it is unclear how this would play out.
