{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

FCX's moat stems primarily from its ownership of long-lived, low-cost copper and gold reserves.  These are valuable, but not irreplaceable.  While barriers to entry in mining are high due to upfront capital costs, other large, well-financed competitors exist and can develop new mines, lessening FCX's long-term competitive advantage.  The company lacks pricing power in a commodity market, making its profits highly dependent on copper prices. Its recent forays into the oil and gas business, which it subsequently divested, underscore its lack of a sustainable competitive advantage beyond its core mining operations.  

{: .warning }

FCX's Indonesian Grasberg mine, one of the world's largest copper and gold mines, faces declining ore grades and increasing political and operational risks. This undermines long-term moat potential.  
  
**Management (2/5):**

{: .important }
While the current management team, led by Richard Adkerson, has overseen growth and steered FCX through challenging commodity cycles, their capital allocation decisions have been questionable. The acquisition and subsequent divestment of the oil and gas assets were ill-timed and value destructive.  Large acquisitions often come at premiums that erase much of the target's value. This was the case with FCX's $30 billion acquisition of Phelps Dodge in 2007, which occurred right before the last big financial crisis.  A 2007 acquisition of Phelps Dodge for over $30 billion, right before a market downturn, raises serious questions about management’s timing and valuation discipline. The company's heavy reliance on debt financing amplifies its cyclicality and increases financial risk.  Executive compensation, while not excessive, is largely tied to stock performance, which can incentivize short-term decision-making at the expense of long-term value creation (e.g. acquisitions in 2016).  While their share repurchase program has been substantial, repurchasing when stock is overvalued is capital destruction. Transparency and communication, particularly about longer-term plans and future commodity price assumptions, could be improved.

{: .note }

In the Q1 2021 earnings call, management mentioned a sharper focus on capital returns and debt reduction, rather than growth.  This may signal a shift in capital allocation strategy, but needs to be verified through future actions.  
  
**Catalyst (3/5):**

{: .highlight }
* **Copper Demand:** The increasing demand for copper driven by global decarbonization trends and electrification could be a significant catalyst.  Electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and grid modernization all require substantial copper inputs. FCX is well-positioned to benefit if copper prices remain elevated.  This is confirmed by the Q2 2024 earnings call where management reiterates that the longer-term copper demand will be driven by the mega-trends of electrification and decarbonization.
{: .highlight }
* **Indonesia’s Royalty Regime:**  The extension of the company's mining rights in Indonesia for another decade is a significant milestone for FCX, as detailed in the company's press release. The Indonesian regulatory and policy environment introduces potential for regulatory tailwinds, which could be a significant boon for investor confidence in its mining operations, which are among its largest holdings.  Further, Indonesian expansion and a move away from being a majority-owned entity would substantially change the way financial and operational metrics are interpreted, so this would also be a catalyst.
{: .highlight }
* **Resolution of Legal Issues:**  Resolving ongoing legal issues, such as the environmental dispute in Indonesia, would remove uncertainty and potentially boost investor confidence.   As an example, the company's Q2 2023 earnings press release announced that it had finalized an agreement with the Indonesian government on taxes, thereby eliminating uncertainty about its future taxation policies.


**Valuation ($44.6 Billion):**

To value FCX, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is employed.  Given the cyclical nature of commodity businesses, the key is normalizing earnings and cash flows.  A 10-year explicit forecast period is used, followed by a terminal value.

**Key Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Assume long-term revenue growth of 2 percent, slightly below long-run U.S. GDP growth. This accounts for increasing competition and declining ore grades at Grasberg, as was highlighted in the Q4 2018 earnings call.
* **Operating Margin:**  Assume a normalized operating margin of 25 percent. This is below the peaks of previous cycles, reflecting competitive pressures and potential cost increases.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Assume a reinvestment rate of 25 percent in stable growth. This assumes substantial ongoing capital expenditures for maintaining existing mines and developing new ones.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Estimate an after-tax cost of debt of 5 percent and a cost of equity of 12 percent, given its risk profile and beta. This leads to a WACC of roughly 10 percent.  This reflects some concerns about FCX’s business risks and operating leverage in a cyclical commodity market. 
* **Terminal Value:**  Assume a stable long-term growth rate of 2 percent and a terminal ROIC of 10 percent.
{: .important }
* **Probability of Financial Distress:**  Given the cyclicality of the commodity market and high financial leverage, assign a 10% probability of financial distress in the next 10 years.   This approach was inspired by the section on "Valuing Financial Service Companies" in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation,* where he uses bond ratings and historical default probabilities to adjust for distress.
* **Distress Sale Value:**  If the firm cannot make it, assume a distress sale value of $10 billion. This was approximately the market capitalization in early 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Project FCF for the next 10 years, incorporating revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment assumptions.  
2. **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value using the stable growth perpetuity formula. 
3. **Present Value:** Discount the FCFs and terminal value back to the present using the WACC.
4. **Distress Adjustment:** Multiply the present value by (1 – Probability of Distress) + (Probability of Distress \* Distress Sale Value / Enterprise Value)
5. **Sum of the Parts:** Add back excess cash and subtract net debt to arrive at the equity value.
6. **Value per Share:** Divide by the number of shares outstanding.

{: .note }
Based on these assumptions and a 2-stage FCFF model, a hypothetical calculation would result in a base case DCF value of ~$54 billion. Then after accounting for the probability of financial distress and subtracting net debt and adding cash and short-term investments, the equity value would become roughly $44.6 Billion.



**Additional Notes:**

* **FCX’s Financial Statements**: Freeport-McMoRan's financial reporting requires careful analysis due to its use of debt and occasional asset write-downs.  A thorough review of its financial statements, including 10-Ks and 10-Qs, is crucial for separating recurring operating performance from noise and financial engineering. For instance, write-offs related to discontinued operations or one-time charges should not be considered part of recurring operations. 
{: .important }
* **Relative Valuation:** Comparing FCX's multiples with other mining companies can provide some insight into relative valuation, but it is important to compare companies with similar underlying characteristics (e.g., cost structure, growth, geographic exposure) and ensure that multiples are calculated consistently.  Freeport-McMoRan currently trades at 7.20 times trailing EBITDA and other valuation metrics are similarly aligned.  This does not provide a clear signal on valuation, hence I'm relying more heavily on the intrinsic valuation approach.
* **Sensitivity Analysis:**  Given uncertainty in commodity prices and the company's operations, conducting sensitivity analysis on key assumptions (e.g., copper price, cost of capital, growth rate) is essential for understanding the range of potential outcomes.
{: .important }
* **Industry Cyclicality**: Remember that commodity businesses are inherently cyclical.  Do not extrapolate current high copper prices indefinitely. {: .important} As per the cyclical adjustments described in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation,* using normalized values is crucial to arrive at realistic values. This point is discussed in detail in the Q2 2019 and the Q4 2022 earnings calls where they discuss strategies to prepare for periods of low copper prices.
