Pessimistic value: $160 B

AstraZeneca is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of prescription medicines in Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism (CVRM), Respiratory & Immunology, and other therapy areas. They operate in a highly competitive industry, with major players like Pfizer, Novartis, and Roche, demanding constant innovation to stay ahead of rivals.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Moat Analysis:**

AstraZeneca's moat stems primarily from a combination of intangible assets (specifically, patents) and the research & development (R&D) process for creating new drugs.

* **Intangible Assets (Patents):** Patents provide temporary monopolies on newly discovered drugs, allowing the company to charge premium prices and generate excess returns on capital. The strength and duration of this patent protection are key to the moat's width.  As patents expire, competition from generic drug manufacturers erodes pricing power.  Patents are a significant but not insurmountable barrier to entry.
* **Research and Development (R&D):** The R&D process is inherently risky and expensive, but it's also the source of new drugs and future growth. AstraZeneca's large R&D budget reflects its commitment to innovation. This large budget itself isn't the moat but a consequence of its existence: A well-funded R&D department can provide a stream of new patented drugs that replenish those losing exclusivity.   However,  R&D is not a guaranteed source of competitive advantage. Success can be fleeting, and many drugs fail in clinical trials.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

A rating of 3 out of 5 reflects a moderately wide moat. AstraZeneca's patent portfolio does give it some pricing power and protection from competition. However, the pharmaceutical industry's dynamic nature, with ever-evolving science and the finite life of patents, demands continuous reinvestment in R&D to maintain its moat. There is no guarantee that current R&D efforts will yield blockbuster drugs in the future.  Additionally, the industry is subject to regulatory changes and political risks that can affect profitability. A more pessimistic outlook considers the high failure rate of drug development and the possibility of disruptive innovation making existing drugs obsolete.

**Valuation:**

Based on AstraZeneca's financial performance over the past few years (2018-2023) and a pessimistic outlook, I arrive at a fair value of approximately $160 billion. This valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, incorporating the following assumptions and calculations:

1. **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth is assumed to be relatively modest, averaging 3.5% annually over the next 10 years. This growth rate reflects the maturity of the overall pharmaceuticals market and the increasing difficulty of achieving high growth rates in large companies. AstraZeneca will likely experience growth from new products and acquisitions but will also experience decline in other product groups.
2. **Operating Margin:** The current operating margin (excluding goodwill) of 21% is assumed to remain relatively stable. Margins are expected to expand modestly in the coming years as a result of cost-cutting and improved efficiency. However, pricing pressure from governments, insurers, and competitors will limit any margin expansion over the long term.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** The reinvestment rate is assumed to decline from its current level of 95% to 20% in perpetuity in conjunction with revenue growth slowing as sales to mature.
4. **Cost of Capital:** The estimated cost of capital (WACC) is 7.5%. This is based on a cost of equity of 9% (derived from the CAPM) and a cost of debt of 4% (estimated from the yield on long-term bonds).
5. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value represents the present value of all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period, and is estimated using the perpetuity growth model. A perpetuity growth rate of 2% is assumed in conjunction with the previously mentioned long-term ROIC and WACC.
6. **Probability of Failure:**  A probability of failure of 10% is assigned to AstraZeneca, given the inherent risks in drug development.
7. **Liquidation Value:**  In case of failure, it is assumed AstraZeneca will receive book value for its assets, which is much less than its fair market value.

**DCF Calculation:**
The DCF is calculated based upon estimated free cash flow (FCF) over the next 10 years (discounted back at cost of capital for each year) added to the terminal value (also discounted back to today), subtracting non-operating assets, and making an adjustment for the probability of failure and liquidation value. 


**Justification for Pessimistic Valuation:**

This valuation errs on the side of pessimism for several reasons.  First, the growth rate assumptions are conservative, given the size and maturity of AstraZeneca and its industry. Competition remains fierce and new entrants continually pursue the industry’s enormous profit pools. Second, the stable margin assumption may be optimistic, given the potential for increased pricing pressure in the future. Finally, the cost of capital could rise if interest rates increase or the company's risk profile deteriorates.



**Additional Considerations:**

* **Management Quality:** AstraZeneca has a strong management team with a good track record. However, management quality is given a relatively low weight in this valuation, following the principle from *The Big Boss* chapter in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth* arguing that management matters less than the business itself. It is the company's moat and its position in a structurally attractive industry, more than any management team, that drives long-term value creation.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  While this valuation recognizes AstraZeneca’s existing moat, the drug development pipeline of competitors is not fully considered, nor is the possibility of unexpected technological disruption. Any breakthroughs by competitors could significantly reduce the value of AstraZeneca’s business.  
* **Regulatory and Political Risks:**  Future changes in government regulation and pricing policy could also affect AstraZeneca’s future performance.  A pessimistic outlook would assume an unfavourable regulatory environment.

This valuation assumes there will be no increase or decrease in share price due to speculation, market mood, or investor sentiment.

**Alternative Valuations and Insights:**

To validate this valuation, using the principles from *Valuation*, you can compare it to the valuations derived using relative valuation approach (based on multiples) and adjusted present value approach (APV).  You can analyze the spread between return on invested capital (ROIC) and WACC (as a measure of moat) for AstraZeneca and its competitors, giving you more context in determining relative values and multiples. You can also analyze performance ratios, and build a more comprehensive picture using qualitative factors and strategic analysis.

Furthermore, the 3P model from *Valuation* as well as its explanation in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* (possible, plausible, probable) would suggest that there is room for disagreement in this valuation as it assumes a continued period of success for AZN, although it is at least plausible.


It is important to note that DCF valuation inherently involves making assumptions about the future.  Even if you are correct, the eventual outcome will almost always differ from your initial estimates. Therefore, it is recommended that you reassess your assumptions annually, or sooner if the underlying business fundamentals change substantially.  Investing always involves uncertainty, and it is critical to accept this uncertainty when making your investment decisions.
