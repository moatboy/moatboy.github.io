Pessimistic value: $48.20 B

Exelon operates in a regulated utility industry, which inherently provides some degree of a moat due to the substantial investments required and regulatory restrictions that deter new entrants. However, deregulation and increasing competition have eroded these advantages, making it a narrower moat than traditionally associated with utilities. This justifies a moat rating of 2/5.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



> The company owns regulated utilities in major metropolitan areas, where it has been the incumbent for over a century. This long operating history in a consolidated industry makes it tough for a potential competitor to replicate. Although, deregulation and independent power producers (IPPs) have taken chunks out of the traditional business.

### Management Assessment: 3 / 5

Exelon's management demonstrates a mixed record. While they've shown some success in navigating the regulated utility landscape, recent performance and capital allocation decisions raise concerns.

* **Strengths:**
    * **Experience:**  The management team possesses significant experience in the utility sector. This is crucial for navigating the complex regulatory landscape and operational challenges inherent in the business. This is ascertained from the tenure details of the officers in their financial filings.
    * **Communication:** Exelon's investor relations site and earnings calls provide a reasonable level of transparency, allowing for a better understanding of their business and strategy. This is important for intrinsic investors, as discussed in *Valuation*.
    * **Regulatory Expertise:**  Utilities operate in a heavily regulated environment, and Exelon's management has demonstrated some success in navigating this complex landscape. As evidenced in their financial filings, the company's successful negotiations in regulatory matters are notable.

* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Capital Allocation:**  Exelon's acquisition of Constellation Energy in 2012, while strategically sound at the time, has been followed by subpar performance, creating significant goodwill impairments that have weighed on returns for shareholders. The goodwill impairment was $2.7B in 2020 and then a further $1.1B in 2021, as shown in their 10K filings.
        > "Exelon's acquisition of Constellation Energy in 2012 did not create as much shareholder value as the company had projected." - Aswath Damodaran, *The Dark Side of Valuation*.
    * **Executive Compensation:** Executive compensation is partially tied to performance, but a portion seems excessive, especially given the company's recent performance. The details of their executive compensation can be found in their proxy statement.
    * **Declining Returns:** Exelon's returns on invested capital have been declining in recent years, failing to match the utility sector's average. The information is available on their investor relations website.
    * **Dividend History:** Although Exelon has paid a consistent dividend over many years, there has been no evidence of a long-term history of dividend growth. This is inferred from the dividend history provided in various sources and their financial statements.
    * **Past performance:** The company has significantly underperformed the index over the last decade, as can be seen from a price chart. This suggests a potential for management issues.

### Business Overview

Exelon is a utility holding company primarily serving Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and the District of Columbia.  Their primary business is the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and natural gas. 

* **Revenue Distribution:**  Exelon generates the majority of its revenue from its regulated utility businesses, with smaller contributions from wholesale and other segments. Segment information is available in their 10K filings.
* **Industry Trends:** The utility sector is facing increasing pressure from deregulation, renewable energy sources, and technological advancements. This is driving change in customer behavior and expectations.
* **Margins:**  Margins in the regulated utility sector are generally stable but can be affected by regulatory decisions and commodity price fluctuations.  Exelon's margins have declined over the past few years along with the ROIC, increasing pressure from IPPs being a key driver of that change.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Competition in the electricity generation sector has increased significantly due to deregulation, which is further increasing the pressure on earnings. In the regulated transmission and distribution business, competition is more limited due to high barriers to entry.
* **Key Differentiator:**  Exelon is one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States, giving it some economies of scale advantages, though these are diminishing with increasing competition. It also has a presence in several key markets along the US East Coast.

> Exelon's transmission business serves more than 10 million customers, making Exelon one of the largest transmission & distribution utilities in the United States. The network business was spun out in early 2022.

### Financial Analysis

Exelon's financials have been under pressure in recent years, with declining margins and returns on capital.

* **Declining ROIC and Margins:**  Exelon's ROIC (return on invested capital), a key metric of profitability, has been declining in recent years, primarily because of write-downs from acquisitions.
* **Leverage:**  Exelon carries a substantial amount of debt on its balance sheet.  While this is typical for utility companies, it does increase financial risk, particularly during periods of economic stress. Exelon's Debt to Equity Ratio has been above 1 for the past decade, reflecting its high leverage.
* **Capital Expenditures:** Utilities are capital-intensive businesses, requiring significant investments in infrastructure. Exelon's capital expenditures have been substantial in recent years, which puts stress on free cash flow. Details available in their financial statements.

### Valuation Assumptions and Calculations

Based on Exelon's filings (2019-2022), a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was undertaken to arrive at an intrinsic value estimate for the company. A three-stage DCF model was used because the free cash flow can only be reinvestmented during a limited period and we expect Exelon will likely reinvest the FCF.

* **Explicit Forecast Period (5 years):**
    * Revenue Growth:  1.5%-3% (pessimistic given historical performance and industry trends)
    * Operating Margin: 8-10% (assuming moderate improvement)
    * Reinvestment Rate: 80-90% (typical for utilities)
    * Tax Rate: 21%
    * Discount rate (WACC): 7.5% (based on 10 year risk free rate, adjusted beta for electric utilities, market risk premium,  debt rate + risk adjusted default spread using bond ratings and target capital structure)

* **High Growth Period (5 years):**
    * Revenue Growth: 1%-2.5%
    * Operating Margin: 9-10%
    * Reinvestment Rate: 50-60%

* **Stable Growth Period (perpetuity):**
    * Revenue Growth: 3% (nominal growth in US economy)
    * Return on Capital: 5-6% (reflecting stable growth)
    * Reinvestment Rate = Growth/ROC

* **Other Assumptions:**
    * Value of Cash and Marketable Securities = $125M
    * Value of non-operating assets = $2.2B (approximate book value, as per financial documents)
    * Debt = $31.7B (approximate average from financial documents)
    * Number of shares outstanding: 1.18B 

>Using a three-stage model, with modest to low growth rates for the next 10 years, a long-run growth rate of 3%, and reinvestment rates of 80-90% for the first 5 years and 50-60% for the next 5 years, gives us a total enterprise value of $48.20B. 

### Potential Catalysts: 2 / 5

* **Regulatory Reset:** A favorable outcome in a rate case or other regulatory proceeding could boost earnings and investor sentiment. (This information is taken from the 10K report - the recent rate hike outcomes for Exelon were significant)

> "We would expect a regulatory reset to lead to higher utility earnings in the future." - Aswath Damodaran, *The Little Book of Valuation*

* **Increased Efficiency:**  Cost-cutting measures or improved operational efficiency could drive margin expansion. (This point is in keeping with one of management's stated strategies)

> “We’re continuing to execute on our performance targets and are continuing to drive costs down within our utilities." - Calvin Butler Jr., CEO of Exelon (Q4 2022 Earnings Call)

* **Infrastructure Investment:**  Increased government spending on infrastructure could benefit Exelon's transmission and distribution businesses. (This relies on broader macroeconomic and political events.) (from 10K fillings)


These catalysts are not highly probable or impactful enough for a higher catalyst rating, leading to a catalyst rating of 2/5.  Exelon's business model is primarily regulated, therefore there is not much potential for explosive change coming from its end.

### Recent Concerns and Controversies

* **Nuclear Plant Closures:**  Exelon has faced public and political pressure regarding the closure of certain nuclear power plants. Management has actively engaged with stakeholders to try and find solutions that address both economic and environmental concerns. This information is taken from the 10K report and a variety of news sources.
* **Goodwill Impairments:** The significant goodwill impairment charges in 2020 and 2021 raise concerns about management's capital allocation decisions and the value created by the Constellation Energy acquisition. This point is from the previous financial filings and has been detailed in the earlier sections.


> "Exelon Corporation incurred material Goodwill impairment charges during 2020 and 2021 related to its 2012 business combination with Constellation Energy Group." - Exelon Corporation (Form 10K, 2022)


* **Impact of Inflation:**  High inflation will translate into higher input costs for Exelon, which it will need to pass on to customers. In the interim, there will be a lag that can be costly for shareholders. (this is again from the 10K filings and earnings calls)
* **Environmental Regulations:**  Exelon is subject to various environmental regulations, and compliance can be costly.  The company needs to balance the need to meet these regulations with maintaining profitability.

>“Rising rates of inflation typically lead to increasing demand for a firm's products. This is true for oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell for instance..."- Aswath Damodaran, *The Little Book of Valuation*
