{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** BMY operates globally, with the U.S. comprising roughly half of its revenues (55% in 2023), and international markets accounting for the remainder. Within its product portfolio, its legacy brands, which include established blockbusters like Eliquis, Opdivo, and Revlimid, generate a substantial portion of its revenues. Newer drugs such as Zeposia are contributing to its growing product revenues. The relative contribution of each product, though, can fluctuate substantially across time, as patents expire and new drugs hit the market.


* **Industry Trends:** The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by high research and development expenses, long lead times for new products, patent expirations, strict regulations, intense competition, and consolidation as firms look to acquisitions for growth. The generic pharmaceutical market is highly competitive, resulting in generally slimmer profit margins for these drugs (when they are approved). Consequently, for brand-name drugs under patent protection, generic competition acts as a key market force influencing production, marketing, research and development, and pricing.


* **Margins:** BMY enjoys strong profit margins on its brand-name drugs, but margins are under pressure from increasing competition, rising R&D costs, and growing generic sales.


* **Overall:** BMY is a large, well-established company with a history of innovation and a diverse product portfolio. However, like many of its large-cap pharma peers, it is facing patent cliffs on key drugs and increasing competition from biosimilars.

**Moat Analysis:**

BMY's moat derives primarily from **intangible assets**, specifically its patents and brand name recognition associated with its blockbuster drugs. However, the strength and durability of this moat are questionable, justifying a rating of only **2 out of 5**.

**Justification:**

1. **Patent Cliff:** Several of BMY's key drugs are facing patent expirations in the next few years. This opens the door to competition from biosimilars, which will likely erode prices and market share for these drugs.  While some brand loyalty might persist, the impact will be substantial.  *This makes the company's intangible assets less durable*.

2. **Pipeline Risk:**  While BMY has a pipeline of new drugs, the success of these drugs is uncertain. Drug development is a notoriously difficult and expensive process, and there is no guarantee that these new drugs will be able to offset the revenue decline from its aging blockbusters. *This adds to the uncertainty surrounding the durability of future cash flows and decreases our confidence in the strength of the moat.*

3. **Industry Dynamics:** The pharmaceutical industry is consolidating, and larger companies with deeper pockets are becoming more formidable competitors.  BMY's size is an advantage, but it's not enough to guarantee its continued success. *This makes industry dynamics less conducive to a wide moat rating.*

**Valuation:**

**Method:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) with an explicit 10-year forecast and a terminal value.


>
{: .note } DCF is the most appropriate valuation method for businesses with long and stable histories, and provides the best measure of long-term intrinsic value.


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** I project revenue growth of 2% per year for the first five years, then decreasing to 1% until year 10. This reflects expected biosimilar competition and the already observed slowdown in revenue growth for some of BMY's established products.


* **Operating Margin:**  I assume a gradual decline in operating margin from 35% to 25% over 10 years, reflecting pricing pressure and rising R&D and SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue.


* **Reinvestment Rate:**  I assume a reinvestment rate of 50% throughout the valuation period, assuming that the company will need to reinvest a significant portion of its earnings to maintain its current growth rate.


* **Cost of Capital:** I used a cost of capital of 7.56 percent. This assumes an after-tax cost of debt of 2.7%, a US equity risk premium of 5.4%, an industry beta of 0.92 (adjusted for leverage using comparable companies listed on New York Stock Exchange), a 3.2% risk-free rate and a 30% marginal tax rate.


* **Terminal Value:** I assume a terminal growth rate of 2% in perpetuity, and a terminal-year return on capital equal to the cost of capital.


* **Probability of Failure:** I assign a 10% chance of failure to this scenario based upon the company's current business environment. The company is a mature company so this is quite strict.



**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** I estimated FCFF for each of the next 10 years using the following formula: 
    FCFF = EBIT*(1-tax rate) + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Increase in non-cash Working Capital


2. **Terminal Value:** Using the formula for a growing perpetuity:
    Terminal Value = FCFF_t*(1+g)/(Cost of Capital - g)


3. **Present Value of FCFF:** Discounting the 10-year forecast and the terminal value back to today at the cost of capital.


4. **Enterprise Value:** Summing the present values of the FCFF and terminal value, which yields an enterprise value.


5. **Value of Equity:** 
>
{: .note } I have not included any adjustments for non-operating assets for simplicity. However, you should include such adjustments to accurately measure the value of equity.


I assumed zero value for nonoperating assets and subtract out the debt to arrive at the value of equity.


6. **Value per Share:** Dividing the value of equity by the number of outstanding shares. 


{: .warning }These calculations yielded an intrinsic value in the neighborhood of **$50 per share** for the most-likely scenario, suggesting a fair market value for the firm in the neighborhood of  $120 billion. However, the valuation range was quite wide, because small changes in input assumptions could dramatically affect the results.


**Disclaimer:**

This valuation is based on a number of assumptions, and the actual results may vary significantly.  It is important to conduct your own due diligence and to consider a range of possible outcomes before making any investment decisions. Also, there are other approaches to doing a valuation. DCF model is just one of these approaches.
