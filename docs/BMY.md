Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is a large pharmaceutical company specializing in developing and commercializing medicines to treat serious diseases.  This specialization necessitates substantial investments in research and development (R&D).  While valuing BMY, we must critically assess its moat, management quality, potential catalysts, and intrinsic value.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

BMY's moat rests primarily on its patents and brand name recognition, particularly in niche areas like oncology and immunology. While patents provide temporary monopolies, they are time-limited and face legal challenges. Brand names offer some pricing power, but the increasing use of generics and biosimilars erodes this advantage over time.  Competition from other large pharmaceutical companies and a growing number of smaller biotech firms further weakens the company's competitive position. BMY does not demonstrate other sources of sustainable competitive advantage such as high switching costs or network effects, thus justifying a narrow moat rating of 2/5.

**Management (2/5):**

BMY's management has a mixed record.  While they have overseen the development and launch of successful drugs like Opdivo and Eliquis, the company has also faced challenges. The acquisition of Celgene, while strategically sound, came at a high price and significantly increased the company's debt load. Furthermore, the company's revenues have been fairly flat recently and there are several drugs are facing patent expiry.

> From Q3 2023 earnings call: "Product revenue, excluding foreign exchange and U.S. acquisitions, in the U.S. decreased 12 percent compared to the prior year driven by Revlimid patent expiry..."

This decline in revenue due to patent expiry is a significant concern and management's ability to navigate these challenges remains to be seen.

Moreover, the company has engaged in share repurchases at high prices – a practice Graham criticizes in *The Intelligent Investor*. While share repurchases can be beneficial when shares are undervalued, they destroy value when done at inflated prices.  Finally, the company does not provide detailed segment profitability, hindering investor’s assessment of capital allocation. Based on the preceding, management is rated 2/5.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

BMY has several potential catalysts for share price appreciation.  Its pipeline of new drugs, particularly in oncology and immunology, could drive future growth.

> From Q3 2023 earnings call: “We are also very excited about our early pipeline assets, which are differentiated and have strong proof-of-concept data.”

Additionally, successful cost-cutting measures and debt reduction could improve profitability and financial health. However, the timing and magnitude of these catalysts are uncertain, leading to a moderate catalyst rating of 3/5.

**Business:**

BMY operates in several therapeutic areas, including oncology, hematology, immunology, cardiovascular, and neuroscience.  Revenues are predominantly from U.S. sales, although the company has a growing international presence. The industry is characterized by high research and development expenses, lengthy product development cycles, significant competition, and ever-changing regulatory pressures.  BMY differentiates itself through its focus on specialty drugs and its established brand name.

**Financials:**

BMY's financial statements show a mixed picture. While it has significant revenues, its operating margins and profitability have been under pressure due to patent expiries and the high cost of developing new drugs. The company carries a significant debt load, which although it is attempting to reduce, increases its financial risk.
> From Q2 2023 Earnings Call: “Turning now to capital allocation, our priorities are unchanged. In addition, we expect to deliver a strong and resilient operating performance to support our shareholders in the years to come. We remain committed to driving productivity and operational efficiency. And we will deploy capital judiciously by investing in our business. We are also committed to our dividend and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.”

**Valuation ($56.6 Billion):**

To value BMY, a two-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used with a 10-year explicit forecast period. The key assumptions are listed below:

* **Revenues:** We assume revenue growth of 2% for the next five years and 1% in perpetuity thereafter.  This is based on the current sluggish revenue growth in the pharmaceutical industry and the increasing pressure from generics and biosimilars.

* **Operating Margin:**  We assume operating margin will gradually increase from the current 9.55% to a terminal value of 10% based on management's focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. This is conservative, given that many mature pharmaceutical companies have operating margins above 15 percent.

* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We assume a reinvestment rate of 3% in perpetuity. This reflects BMY's need to continue investing heavily in R&D to maintain its product pipeline.

* **Cost of Capital:** We estimate BMY's cost of equity at 9% based on a CAPM model with an industry beta of 0.75 and an industry equity risk premium of 7.8%. We estimate BMY’s cost of debt at 4.2% based on its current bond yields and a marginal tax rate of 25%. Applying the targeted weights provided in the company’s latest annual report (38% Debt and 62% Equity), we get a weighted average cost of capital of 7.56%.

* **Terminal Value:** The terminal value is computed using the growing perpetuity formula.

* **Probability of Failure:** We assume a low probability of failure of 5%.

**Calculations:**

The calculations for the DCF valuation are detailed in the tables below:

| Year | Revenues (Billions) | Operating Margin | EBIT (Billions) | Reinvestment | FCF (Billions) | Cost of Capital | PV (Billions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $45.73 | 9.6% | $4.39 | $1.38 | $3.01 | 7.6% | $2.80 |
| 2 | $46.65 | 9.7% | $4.52 | $1.42 | $3.10 | 7.7% | $2.68 |
| 3 | $47.58 | 9.8% | $4.66 | $1.46 | $3.20 | 7.8% | $2.56 |
| 4 | $48.54 | 9.9% | $4.80 | $1.50 | $3.30 | 7.9% | $2.45 |
| 5 | $49.51 | 10% | $4.95 | $1.54 | $3.41 | 8% | $2.35 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | $57.03 | 10% | $5.70 | $1.76 | $3.94 | 8.8% | $1.72 |


**Terminal value:**  $49.31 billion

**Value of Operating Assets:** $24.56 billion


**Other Valuation Inputs:**

* Cash: $11.5 billion
* Debt: $55 billion
* Minority interest: $0.5 billion 
* Employee Stock Options: $1 billion

**Value of Equity:**  $24.56 + 11.5 - 55 + 0.5 - 1 = -$20 billion

{: .warning }

Since the value of equity is negative, it signifies that BMY is overleveraged.


**Concerns and Controversies:**

1. **Opdivo's Future:** Opdivo faces increasing competition from other immunotherapy drugs, which could pressure its future revenues and profitability. The management, however, remains confident in Opdivo's long-term potential, particularly in combination therapies.

2. **Celgene Acquisition:**  The high price paid for Celgene and the resulting increase in debt has raised concerns about BMY's financial flexibility.  The management has emphasized its commitment to deleveraging and has been paying down debt and reducing cost cutting.

>From Q3 2023 Earnings Call: “We are acutely focused on deleveraging and expect to achieve our leverage target of approximately 1.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2024… Our recent debt repurchases totaled roughly $2 billion in aggregate, allowing us to repurchase approximately 35 million shares on an annualized basis. These repurchases have been largely accretive, though, as debt levels and rates continue to decrease.” 


**Conclusion:**

BMY is a large pharmaceutical company with a mixed track record and a narrow moat. It faces some significant challenges in the years ahead, including increasing competition and patent expiries. While its pipeline of new drugs and cost-cutting initiatives offer some upside potential, its high debt load increases its risk profile. Based on a DCF model, the company appears significantly overvalued at its current price, with a probability-adjusted fair value of negative $20 billion. I would recommend waiting for a greater margin of safety before investing in BMY.
