Pessimistic value: $12.3 B

Molson Coors faces intense competition in a mature, slow-growth industry, limiting its ability to achieve and maintain pricing power. While the company possesses some brand strength, this advantage is insufficient to warrant a wide moat rating.  Cost advantages are also limited due to the commodity nature of many of its inputs and the ability of competitors to achieve similar economies of scale.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5): Narrow**

Molson Coors' moat is primarily derived from its brand portfolio, including Coors Light, Miller Lite, and Blue Moon. These brands have established market share and customer loyalty. However, brand loyalty in the beer industry is often fickle, and competition from both large international brewers and smaller craft breweries is fierce. This makes it difficult for the company to raise prices or significantly increase market share, thus limiting its moat to a narrow rating. As highlighted by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, truly great businesses need a structural advantage that creates pricing power and protects high returns on capital for an extended period. While brands can provide a moat, in the case of Molson Coors it appears to be a shallow moat, easily stormed by competitive pressure.  Similar to the examples of mistaken moats described by Dorsey, brand recognition alone is not enough. The company needs to demonstrate pricing power and sustained high returns on capital.  The company faces intense competition, pressuring its margins and creating a difficult environment for sustained high returns on invested capital.

**Management (2/5):**

While Molson Coors' management team has experience in the beverage industry, their capital allocation decisions have been questionable, and their communication with investors could be improved.

* **Capital Allocation:** The company has a history of making acquisitions, some of which have destroyed shareholder value. While recent acquisitions like the purchase of the remaining stake in MillerCoors offered apparent cost savings, it does not offset prior value destruction. The company should focus on improving operating efficiency within its current portfolio rather than chasing growth through acquisitions. The MillerCoors stake purchase, and the discussion of how it benefits Molson Coors by Gavin Hattersley, in the Q2 2019 earnings call, exemplifies this potential capital allocation inefficiency. 
* **Communication:** While management provides earnings guidance and participates in earnings calls, their communication could be more transparent. They should provide more insight into their long-term strategy and the rationale behind their capital allocation decisions.  The strategic analysis described in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies* highlights how effective communication can align management and shareholders and make better strategic decisions.  
* **History and Experience:** The company’s management team, headed by Gavin Hattersley as CEO and Tracey Joubert as CFO, have prior experience in beverages or similar industries, which provides some positive signals. 
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation appears to be in line with industry standards, though it could be better tied to value creation metrics (ROIC, growth). This could create better incentives for management to prioritize value creation.  This echoes the principles laid out in *The Essays of Warren Buffett* where Buffett emphasizes the importance of aligning management compensation with shareholder interests.

**Catalyst (1/5):**

There are no obvious upcoming catalysts that could significantly increase the share price in the near future. The company operates in a mature, slow-growth industry, and its prospects for significant market share gains or margin expansion are limited.  Similar to Michael Burry's approach in the provided MSN Money articles, a catalyst often involves a specific event or development (such as an acquisition or new product), or a significant shift in market perception. Neither scenario is apparent for Molson Coors right now.

**Business:**

Molson Coors operates in the global beer market, primarily in North America, Europe, and several smaller international markets.  The company’s revenues are derived from sales of beer brands across a range of price points and styles, including premium light lagers, craft beers, and non-alcoholic beverages. The beer market is highly competitive, with major international brewers and smaller craft brewers vying for market share. The company's revenues are heavily reliant on sales of its core brands in its primary markets of North America (around 70 percent of 2022 revenue according to the Q4 2022 earnings call) and Europe. Trends in the beer industry include increasing premiumization (consumers trading up to more expensive beers), growing popularity of craft and non-alcoholic beers, and increasing competition from smaller, independent breweries. Molson Coors has a relatively low-cost business model compared to some competitors, selling mass-market, low-price brands, which is becoming more challenging as consumers trade up, as highlighted by the company's management in earnings calls.

**Financials:**

Molson Coors has generated modest revenue growth in recent years. It’s operating margins are below industry average and have faced pressure from rising input costs and increased competition.  The company has used debt to finance acquisitions and share buybacks, and its debt levels are relatively high compared to its peers.  Return on invested capital has historically been around 10 percent, which is close to the cost of capital. As noted in *Valuation*, ROIC is the key value driver, and if a company cannot generate excess returns, there will be no value creation. In 2019, the company’s management discussed their deleveraging efforts, and the intent to reduce debt levels further to reduce leverage, as addressed by the CEO, Gavin Hattersley, in the Q2 2019 earnings call. This move suggests that the company’s high debt levels were previously recognized as a potential issue.

**Valuation (Discount Cash Flow – DCF): $12.3 Billion**

* **Forecast period:** 5 years (2023–2027) followed by continuing value.
* **Revenue growth:** In line with long-term historical growth in beer sales which, as shown by numerous academic studies, has generally been in line with population growth (3 percent) - this makes for a pessimistic outlook.
* **Operating Margin:** Gradually improving to 15% by 2027.
* **Reinvestment rate:** Consistent with historical levels. (Average over 2018 - 2022 = 14.8%).
* **Cost of capital:**  Using the CAPM, risk-free rate of 4%, market risk premium of 5.5%, and adjusted beta of 0.8, the pretax cost of equity equals 8.4%. Using company’s long-term debt, marginal tax rate of 21% and target capital structure (50% debt, 50% equity), cost of debt equals 2.36%. WACC then equals 5.59%.
* **Continuing value:** Based on the terminal value formula using a perpetual growth rate of 3% for FCF.
* **Discount rate:** WACC.

**Recent Concerns:**

Declining beer volumes in developed markets and rising input costs have been recent challenges for Molson Coors.  The company is addressing these challenges by premiumizing its portfolio, expanding into new categories like hard seltzers and non-alcoholic beverages, and focusing on cost savings. In the Q1 2023 earnings call, management discussed the significant inflationary cost pressures they are facing, and admitted that their revenue growth is a bit too slow, given inflation. They also discussed some of their new beverages and their plans to expand them into new territories, as addressed by the CEO, Gavin Hattersley, in the Q1 2023 earnings call. 

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful expansion of new product lines:**  The company's success in growing its hard seltzer and non-alcoholic beverage portfolio could be a catalyst.  However, similar to Michael Burry’s assessment of ethanol companies in the early 2000s, new categories do not automatically translate into profit, even with juicy margins.  As mentioned by Burry in his journal, a confluence of factors often conspire to create those margins. Absent evidence that Molson Coors possesses a sustainable competitive advantage in these new categories, there is significant risk that those efforts might be for naught.
* **Improved profitability in core brands:**  If Molson Coors can successfully implement cost-saving initiatives and maintain stable pricing in its core brands, it could improve profitability and boost the share price. However, given the intense competition, pricing power is likely to be restrained by competitors’ actions.
* **Debt reduction:**  If the company can significantly reduce its debt levels, it could improve its financial health and make it more attractive to investors.  However, management needs to balance debt reduction with investments in growth initiatives, and the current leverage is likely to limit management’s flexibility.
