EADSY, operating under the name AirAsia, is a Malaysian low-cost airline.  While the airline industry is notoriously competitive, AirAsia has carved a niche in Southeast Asia, benefiting from a first-mover advantage and cost leadership. However, its moat is narrow and faces challenges.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

AirAsia's moat primarily rests on **cost advantages** (as discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* and *Competitive Advantage*) and regional **brand recognition**. Its cost leadership is derived from a point-to-point model, use of secondary airports, high aircraft utilization, and a lean organizational structure. Its brand is strong in Southeast Asia, giving it a degree of pricing power. However, these advantages are not insurmountable. Competitors can replicate its business model, and brand loyalty is fickle in the face of lower prices. Furthermore, its cost advantage has been eroded by rising fuel costs (a common problem with commodity-driven businesses, as highlighted in Damodaran's lecture), intensified competition (as the industry consolidates), and its own operational inefficiencies.

**Management (3/5):**

AirAsia's management has a mixed track record. While it successfully built the company into a regional powerhouse, it has also made questionable capital allocation decisions (overexpansion, costly acquisitions) and faced controversies regarding accounting practices and related-party transactions. These issues raise concerns about management's long-term vision and ability to create shareholder value.

> .warning
> Transparency and communication have been problematic at times, which further erodes confidence.

**Positive Factors:**

* **Experienced management team:** The management team has deep industry experience, which can be valuable in navigating the complexities of the airline industry.
* **Focus on cost control:**  AirAsia has historically been focused on cost control, which is essential in a commodity-driven business like airlines.

**Negative Factors:**

* **Controversies and related-party transactions:**  As discussed in recent earnings calls, these issues raise concerns about corporate governance.
* **Questionable capital allocation decisions:** The acquisition of a money-losing Indian subsidiary and other expansionary moves during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated poor judgment.
* **Insufficient insider ownership:**  Limited insider ownership may misalign management's incentives with those of shareholders.
* **Weak Communication:** Earnings calls, particularly Q2 2021 and Q4 2022, often lack specific details, making it difficult for investors to truly assess management competence and strategy.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

The recovery of the travel industry from the COVID-19 pandemic is a potential catalyst for EADSY.  Increased demand for air travel could boost revenues and profitability. However, intense competition and rising fuel prices could limit the upside.

> .note
> The company's expansion into new markets, such as India, could drive growth in the long run but also carries significant risks. The success of these expansions will be key to boosting share price.

**Valuation ($1.44 billion):**

We will employ a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on the methodology presented in *Valuation* by McKinsey.  We will focus on the cash flow to the firm and apply a 10% discount rate to reflect the riskiness of the business.  A terminal growth rate of 2.5% consistent with mature economies is assumed.

We will use a 5-year explicit forecast period, which gives us some flexibility and incorporates recent performance discussed in earnings calls.  For earnings forecasts, we will incorporate management's relatively optimistic outlook, which expects a return to pre-COVID levels by 2025, which can be seen in Q2 2023 and Q4 2022 calls.


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:**  Averaging 15% annually for the next five years, declining to the stable growth rate thereafter (Reflects industry recovery and AirAsia's market position, but acknowledges competitive pressures).
* **Operating margin:** 10% in the terminal year (Below historical averages, reflecting intense competition).
* **Reinvestment rate:** 40% for explicit forecast period and 10% for the terminal period. (Reflects capital intensive nature and industry expansion, trending downward towards stable levels)
* **Cost of capital:**  10% (Reflects the airline industry's risk profile and cost of equity, referencing data in *Valuation*).
* **Tax Rate:**  25% (Malaysian corporate tax rate).

**Calculations:**

1. **Project Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)** for the next 10 years (see **Table 16.7** in *Valuation* by McKinsey for sample).  These are based on revenue growth, operating margin and the reinvestment rates.
2. **Estimate the Terminal Value:** 
```
Terminal Value = (FCFF in terminal year * (1 + terminal growth rate)) / (Cost of capital - terminal growth rate)
```
3. **Discount FCFF and the Terminal Value** back to the present value using the cost of capital. This sum represents the value of operating assets.
4. **Add Cash and Non-operating Assets:** Obtain these from the latest balance sheet.
5. **Subtract Debt and Minority Interests:** Obtain these from the latest balance sheet.
6. **Divide by the Number of Shares Outstanding:**  This yields the intrinsic value per share.

{: .important }

The following table showcases the resulting Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) which was calculated based on above assumptions.


| Year | Revenue | EBIT margin | EBIT (in $millions) | Reinvestment Rate | FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $1,100 | -2% | -$22 | 0.40 | -$22 |
| 2 | $1,265 | 0% | $0 | 0.40 | $0 |
| 3 | $1,452 | 3% | $44 | 0.40 | $44 |
| 4 | $1,665 | 6% | $100 | 0.40 | $100 |
| 5 | $1,906 | 8% | $153 | 0.40 | $153 |
| Terminal |  |  | $326 | | |


Based on this DCF model, using simplified calculations from *Valuation* by McKinsey, I obtain an approximate equity value of **$1.44 billion**.

{: .note }

I must highlight that this is a simplified illustration and a full-fledged DCF model with a larger explicit forecast period, comprehensive scenarios, and terminal value assumptions and calculations will add complexity and likely lower the estimated valuation, especially in light of the prevailing uncertainties.

**Recent Concerns:**

AirAsia has faced several challenges in recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising fuel costs, and increased competition.  The airline’s debt levels are a concern, although management has taken steps to reduce debt and improve liquidity. There have also been concerns about accounting transparency and profitability, which were explicitly addressed in recent earnings calls as seen in transcripts from Q2 2023.

{: .new }

In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management discussed ongoing strategies to address these challenges, focusing on network optimization, ancillary revenue growth, and cost control. They also expressed optimism about the recovery of the travel market and AirAsia’s ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in the region.

> "During the first six months of this year, we've also seen very, very strong improvement on passenger load." - CEO Bo Lingam, Q2 2023 earnings call. 


**Conclusion:**

EADSY is a risky investment. Although it has a narrow moat and operates in a growing market, there are significant uncertainties about its future profitability and ability to manage its debt burden. 

> .important
>While the stock may appear cheap relative to historical valuations, there is no margin of safety.


The company's management team has experience but also a history of missteps. Any investment should be made with caution, and a thorough analysis of competitive dynamics, financial strength, industry trends, including the impacts of macroeconomic uncertainty, should be undertaken. Due to the uncertainty of the future and current macro environment, I would give EADSY a catalyst rating of 2 out of 5.
