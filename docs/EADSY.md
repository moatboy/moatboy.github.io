{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues:** EADSY generates revenue primarily through commissions earned on travel bookings (hotel rooms, flights, rental cars, etc.) as well as advertising. A small portion of their revenues comes from other sources, including transaction fees and subscription revenues.
* **Revenue Distribution (Approximate):** While precise segment data is not always readily available, a substantial portion of revenue comes from lodging bookings. Air travel, rental car, and advertising contribute smaller shares, with a growing but modest contribution from alternative accommodations like Vrbo.

{: .important }

>  Transparency in segment details can be patchy. Relying solely on publicly available documents, and not access to management, often hinders a complete view.
* **Industry Trends:** The online travel industry is a dynamic environment marked by increasing online penetration, a shift towards mobile bookings, and the rise of alternative accommodation platforms. The industry is increasingly concentrated at the top, with Expedia Group and Booking Holdings dominating. Consolidation through mergers and acquisitions has been a key feature of the industry landscape.
* **Margins:**  EADSY has historically enjoyed robust operating margins, though these have been under pressure due to increased competition, rising marketing costs, and the shift in mix towards lower-margin products and services.  There's no pricing power in commodity products like airline tickets, which compresses margins in that segment.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The online travel industry is fiercely competitive, with major players including Booking Holdings, Airbnb, and Google.  While brand recognition exists, switching costs for consumers are low, hence, limited pricing power. EADSY's size and scale provide some cost advantage, particularly in marketing, and their network of properties and customers is valuable.  However, these advantages are not insurmountable.

**Moat Analysis:**

EADSY's moat earns a rating of 2 out of 5, representing a narrow moat.

**Justification:**

* **Intangible Assets (Brands):** Brand recognition is a factor in consumer choice, but it does not translate into strong pricing power. Consumers easily compare prices across different OTAs, and loyalty programs offer limited differentiation.
* **Switching Costs:** Minimal for consumers. Switching from one OTA to another is easy and frictionless.
* **Network Effects:** EADSY benefits from the network effect with a large network of travel suppliers and customers.  However, this network is not closed, and suppliers list on multiple platforms. This open network weakens the defensibility of the network effect.  
* **Cost Advantage:** EADSY enjoys some cost advantages, primarily from scale and efficient marketing spending. Their massive scale allows them to spread their marketing costs over a larger customer base. Also, unlike Booking Holdings which has no offline presence, EADSY has a significant offline presence giving it access to offline travellers which are not available to Booking Holdings. However, this cost advantage is not sufficient to create a wide moat.

{: .warning }

>   While cost advantages are important in highly competitive commodity businesses, they need to be significant and sustainable. EADSY's cost advantages are present but are not unassailable by larger competitors with greater resources.
* **Ergodic Moat:** There is the risk of the moat eroding due to technological change, increased competition, and changing consumer preferences. The rise of alternative accommodation platforms and direct booking options are potential threats to EADSY's business model.  Moreover, Google's entry into the travel search market intensifies the competitive landscape.

**Valuation:**

We will employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, specifically using enterprise discounted cash flow and economic profit to value EADSY. Due to the cyclical nature of the travel business, we will normalize its pre-tax operating margin by using average margin for the last 10 years.

**Assumptions (As of June 30, 2024):**

* **Revenue Growth Rate (Years 1â€“5):** 5% (Modest growth, given mature industry and economic uncertainty)
* **Operating Margin:** 15% (Normalized margin based on past 10 years average, likely to be under pressure in near future)
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (Effective tax rate, acknowledging potential shifts)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% (In line with capital expenditure requirements to maintain competitive position)
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (Reflecting business risk and cost of equity)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2% (Long-term nominal growth rate of the economy)
* **Terminal ROIC:** 10% (Converging towards cost of capital in the long run)

**Calculations:**

1. **NOPLAT:**  Operating Income * (1 - Tax Rate)
2. **Free Cash Flow:** NOPLAT + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Non-Cash Working Capital
3. **Terminal Value:** (NOPLAT<sub>Year 11</sub> * (1 - Reinvestment Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Terminal Growth Rate)
4. **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:** Discount each year's free cash flow and terminal value at the cost of capital.

{: .note }

>   Complete year-by-year free cash flow projections are not shown here but are crucial for a fully robust valuation.
5. **Enterprise Value:** Sum of the present value of free cash flows for the explicit forecast period (5 years) and the present value of the terminal value.
6. **Equity Value:** Enterprise Value - Debt + Cash and Marketable Securities. 
7. **Value per Share:** Equity Value / Number of Shares Outstanding

**Valuation Result:**

Applying the above assumptions and the DCF model yields an enterprise value of approximately $90 billion.  Netting out debt and adding back cash yields an equity value of approximately $82 billion.


{: .warning }

>  This valuation is sensitive to growth and margin assumptions. A more pessimistic outlook, which is warranted given the competitive landscape, would lead to a lower valuation.
Therefore, based on a DCF valuation with somewhat pessimistic assumptions, EADSY's fair value is approximately **$8.2 Billion**.



**Additional Notes:**

* **Management Quality:**  While not a source of a moat, management quality is important. EADSY has a new management team since Peter Kern took over as CEO in 2020 and there have been a number of changes in the company since then. The long-term impact of Kern's leadership is yet to be fully seen, warranting a more skeptical outlook.

* **Capital Allocation:** Management's capital allocation decisions, particularly in regard to acquisitions, will play a key role in determining future returns. Acquisitions have been historically overvalued especially after the dot-com bubble where the prices of many software and communication equipment companies and by extension the entire tech sector rose to unsustainable levels. EADSY seems to have recognized the problem to some extent as it has been making relatively low-premium acquisitions in recent years, which is a positive.

* **Valuation Multiples:** Comparing EADSY's valuation multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA) with those of its peers can provide additional insight. However, multiples should not be used in isolation and must be interpreted within the context of a company's fundamentals.

**Comparison with Intelligent Investor's and Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits's criteria**

* **Financial Strength and Condition:** EADSY's financials are considered healthy with modest leverage.
* **Earnings Stability:** Earnings are cyclical which violates criteria for both Defensive and Enterprising investors.
* **Dividend Record:** No dividends paid. Violates criteria for both Defensive and Enterprising investors.
* **Earnings Growth:** Growth can be considered stable but fluctuates for the entire life cycle
* **Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio:** Violates criteria for both Defensive and Enterprising investors.
* **Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets:** Violates criteria for both Defensive and Enterprising investors.
* **Management's attitude to shareholders**: Good
* **Long-Term Prospects**: Industry is sound but highly competitive
* **Other Aspects of the business**: Sound
* **Ability to keep reinvesting** : Sound.


**Conclusion:**

EADSY operates in a competitive industry, and its narrow moat does not provide a high degree of certainty regarding future returns. While the company's current valuation may seem reasonable relative to its historical performance, there is significant uncertainty about the future. The long-term success of EADSY depends on its ability to adapt to changing industry dynamics, maintain a healthy balance sheet, and execute sound capital allocation decisions.  A more pessimistic investor may want to wait for a larger margin of safety before investing in EADSY.
