{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

EXR possesses elements of a moat, primarily stemming from brand name and scale in the suburban self-storage market.  

* **Brand:** The company's brand name carries weight within its market, giving it an edge in attracting customers. This is evidenced by its premium pricing relative to peers, discussed in detail below. However, the self-storage industry is becoming increasingly commoditized, eroding brand advantages. Moreover, PSA's brand has been around longer and therefore has more weight.
* **Scale:** EXR’s extensive network provides benefits in terms of operational efficiency (lower costs of marketing, procurement, etc.), allowing it to maintain strong margins. However, scale advantages are limited primarily to local markets, and PSA's scale is far greater. Further, scale-related operational efficiency gains are not always passed on to customers due to competitive price pressure.


**Management (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:** EXR's management team has a generally good track record of managing the business and delivering returns for shareholders, particularly in acquisitions and property management. However, concerns arise regarding their forward-looking capability and adapting to the changing competitive landscape, as evidenced by their struggle to maintain high occupancy rates and same-store sales growth amid increased competition.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is largely tied to earnings and other performance metrics, potentially incentivizing short-term actions. While the company stresses growth, it does so often through acquisitions at times with significant premiums.  
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, suggesting a potential lack of full alignment with shareholders’ long-term interests.  
* **Communication:** While EXR management appears to communicate candidly about its near-term plans, they frequently offer optimistic guidance, particularly on same-store sales growth.
* **Capital Allocation:** The company's capital allocation decisions have been mixed. They have been successful in acquisitions, particularly in finding small, underpriced self-storage properties in the past. However, there are growing concerns about the premiums paid for more recent acquisitions.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Industry Consolidation:** The self-storage industry remains fragmented, offering potential for further consolidation through mergers and acquisitions, which could drive EXR's share price higher. However, the pace of consolidation has slowed in recent years, as competition intensifies.
* **Improving Operating Performance:** If EXR is able to improve operating performance by increasing occupancy rates and same-store sales growth, its share price could increase. However, this may be challenging given the intensifying competition.
* **Expansion into New Markets:** There may also be some opportunities for value creation through expansion into new, emerging markets. However, such ventures can be high-risk, and EXR’s ability to successfully expand outside the U.S. is unproven.

**Business:**

EXR primarily operates in the suburban self-storage market, which has several characteristics.

* **Fragmented Industry:** The self-storage industry is highly fragmented, with the largest player, PSA, holding only a small percentage of the market. This fragmentation has historically allowed smaller players like EXR to thrive by focusing on niche markets. However, the industry has experienced some consolidation in recent years, leading to more intense competition.  
* **Recurring Revenue:**  Self-storage generates recurring revenue, which is generally less sensitive to economic downturns, contributing to the sector’s historically stable cash flows. However, this recurring revenue base does not offer any special protection when demand for self-storage space dries up.
* **Low Switching Costs:** Switching costs for customers are low, making it essential for self-storage operators to offer competitive prices and high-quality service. This makes customer loyalty challenging.
* **Regional Focus:** EXR focuses on primarily suburban self-storage. PSA, in contrast, has a national focus.
* **Seasonality:** The business is subject to seasonality, with demand fluctuating with seasonal and cyclical factors. 

**Financials:**

EXR has historically performed well, generating strong returns and cash flow. However, growth has stalled in recent years, and margins have been under pressure, partly due to the increased competition.

From 2019 annual report to 2022 annual report, revenues increased from \$4.5 billion to \$5.8 billion, while the pretax operating margin dropped from 48.7% to 45.4%. This reflects both the challenges caused by the pandemic as well as the increased competition.


**Valuation ($16.5 Billion):**

The following is a business valuation of Extra Space Storage using a DCF model based on 2022 financial data adjusted for operating leases and the company's 2023 first and second quarter earnings calls and company SEC filings. We will use the equity cash flow approach, which reflects how the company delivers its earnings to its shareholders, including dividend payments and share repurchases. We are not using relative valuation metrics based upon EBIT or EBITDA because these metrics can significantly fluctuate throughout a company's reporting period based upon acquisition or impairment accounting.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume that revenue growth returns from its recent low of 3% in 2022 (due to the economic slowdown and the pandemic) back to 6% annually for the next five years, a relatively conservative estimate.
* **Operating Margin:** We expect the operating margin to stabilize around its long-term average of 45%. We recognize that current margins are slightly higher (47.2% in 2022) due to cost-cutting, but we believe that margins will decline due to the increasing competitive pressure in a moderately growing business environment.
* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** The sales to invested capital ratio is currently 0.7. Since the self-storage industry has low capital intensity, we forecast the ratio to remain stable.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We will assume a reinvestment rate of 40% (calculated as 6%/15% based on the revenue growth rate and return on new invested capital).
* **Cost of Equity:** A reasonable and conservative discount rate for equity cash flows is 10%, calculated as:
    * Risk-free rate (10-year T-Bond) = 4%
    * Equity risk premium = 5.5%
    * Beta = 1.1 (Based on a regression of monthly returns of EXR against the S\&P 500 over the past 5 years. Using five years of data instead of one year reduces potential distortions.)
    * Cost of Equity = 4% + 1.1 * 5.5% = 10.05%
* **Cost of Debt:** We estimate the cost of debt to be 5%, which is slightly above the current market rate. This assumes a potential increase in interest rates in the future.
* **Target Capital Structure:** We assume EXR will maintain its debt ratio around its long-term average of 50%.
* **Tax Rate:** The marginal tax rate is 25%. 

**Calculations:**

* **NOPLAT** (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes) will be calculated based on the preceding assumptions.
* **Free Cash Flow to Equity** (FCFE) will be computed for each of the next five years using the formula: FCFE = NI – (1 – Debt ratio) × (Net investment).
* **Terminal Value:** After five years, we assume a stable growth rate of 3%, which is a conservative estimate below current real GDP growth. 
We estimate terminal value using the perpetuity method and the following formula: Terminal Value = FCFE/(Cost of Equity - Growth Rate)

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model Output:**

| Year | FCFE ($ millions) | Present Value Factor | Present Value of FCFE ($ millions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | \$565 | 0.909 | \$514 |
| 2 | \$633 | 0.826 | \$523 |
| 3 | \$710 | 0.751 | \$533 |
| 4 | \$796 | 0.683 | \$543 |
| 5 | \$892 | 0.621 | \$554 |
| Terminal Value |  |  | \$10,860 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** |  |  | \$13,527 |

* **Cash:** EXR had \$126 million in cash at the end of 2022.
* **Debt:** EXR had approximately \$4.5 Billion of debt outstanding at the end of 2022.
* **Value of Equity:** Value of Equity = Enterprise Value + Cash - Debt = \$13,527 + \$126 - \$4,500 = \$9,153 million

* **Number of Shares:**  EXR had 165.30 million shares outstanding at the end of 2022.
* **Estimated Equity Value per Share:** Estimated Value per Share = Value of Equity/Number of Shares = \$9,153/165.3 = \$55.37 per share

**Additional Considerations and Concerns:**

* **Competition:** EXR is facing increasing competition, especially from PSA and other large players. PSA is larger, more national, and better known than EXR.
* **Overreliance on Acquisitions:** EXR's growth has been driven primarily by acquisitions, which can be risky. The company has paid significant premiums for some of its acquisitions, raising concerns about its capital allocation decisions.
* **Interest Rate Risk:**  As interest rates rise, the cost of capital increases, potentially reducing the value of EXR. The company's significant debt load makes it vulnerable to interest rate increases.  Moreover, rising interest rates affect real estate cap rates. In addition, rising interest rates may diminish the amount of capital available to the self-storage industry. Further, EXR’s debt contracts include some floating-rate debt, making them sensitive to interest rate changes. 

**Recent Developments and Potential Catalysts:**

EXR's management team is taking several steps to address recent challenges, including focusing on operational efficiencies, optimizing its portfolio, and selectively investing in growth initiatives. However, these may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of increasing competition and rising interest rates. 

From the 2023 Quarter 2 earnings call:
{: .highlight }

The most important catalyst is to see if the company can continue to find small storage facilities to acquire.

* **Occupancy rates:** EXR has been struggling to maintain high occupancy rates, which have been declining in recent years, mainly due to increased competition.  
* **Same-store sales growth:** EXR's same-store sales growth has been slowing down, which is concerning given the high valuations.
* **Internal growth:** EXR management has repeatedly stated that it intends to find further acquisitions.

{: .warning }

The industry, however, is becoming increasingly competitive, and it may be difficult for EXR to consistently find attractive opportunities to generate growth and deliver returns in the coming years.


**Overall Assessment:**

EXR possesses some elements of a moat, but it is not as wide or as deep as some of the other companies discussed in the provided resources. The management team has a good track record, but there are some concerns about their ability to adapt to the changing competitive landscape. The company is trading at a discount to its intrinsic value; however, the valuation is sensitive to changes in assumptions, especially those regarding growth and competition. Given the increasing competition and rising interest rates, a cautious, pessimistic outlook is warranted.
