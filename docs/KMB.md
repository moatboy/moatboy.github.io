Kimberly-Clark (KMB) is a consumer staples company that manufactures and markets personal care, consumer tissue, and professional products. While it boasts well-known brands and a global presence, a strict and pessimistic analysis reveals a narrow moat and a management team that has failed to capitalize on the company's full potential.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

KMB's narrow moat stems primarily from its intangible assets—its brands. Consumers associate names like Huggies, Kleenex, and Cottonelle with quality and reliability, leading to repeat purchases and some pricing power.  However, this brand strength is not absolute. As Pat Dorsey discusses in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brand power is only a moat if it gives a company pricing power. KMB operates in a highly competitive landscape with low switching costs. Competitors can easily replicate product features and undercut KMB on price, limiting the company's ability to raise prices significantly. Additionally, the rise of private-label brands further pressures KMB's pricing power, as seen in the decline of market share for some of its core products (discussed in Q2 2023 earnings call). KMB lacks meaningful switching costs or network effects, further weakening its competitive advantage.

**Management (2/5):**

While KMB has historically delivered solid returns, a closer look reveals a mixed track record.  

* **Capital Allocation:** KMB's recent focus on share buybacks has not translated into significant shareholder value. As discussed in Q2 2023 earnings call, the company has spent billions on buybacks, yet share price appreciation has been modest. This raises concerns about whether management is effectively allocating capital, especially given limited organic growth opportunities.  
* **Growth:**  Organic growth has been sluggish, and KMB has increasingly relied on acquisitions for growth, which is less value-creating than organic growth (as noted in *Valuation* by McKinsey). The 2018 acquisition of Softex Indonesia (discussed in KMB’s 2022 10K) has not yet delivered the promised growth, adding to the skepticism about management's ability to integrate acquisitions effectively and generate synergistic returns.
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** While executive compensation is tied to performance, a detailed review reveals a limited correlation with value creation for shareholders. The levels of insider ownership are not high enough to fully align management's interests with those of shareholders, as emphasized by Warren Buffett in his writings (included in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*).
* **Communication:**  Management communication during earnings calls often lacks detailed insights into individual business segments' performance and future prospects. As highlighted by Michael Burry's analysis in the provided articles, it’s crucial to delve deep into the specifics of each business segment.  
* **Cost Cutting:** While management emphasizes cost-cutting measures in their communication (highlighted in Q2 2023 earnings call), the long-term impact on profitability remains uncertain, especially given inflationary pressures and competitive intensity.

{: .warning }

The recent resignation of the CFO, as discussed in the September 2023 news article, is a red flag and raises concerns about potential internal issues that may be impacting financial reporting or overall management effectiveness.


**Catalyst (1/5):**

{: .note }

There are no significant upcoming catalysts that could significantly increase KMB's share price. 
The company's focus on cost-cutting and acquisitions may generate modest improvements in the short term, but the underlying business dynamics suggest limited upside potential.


**Business Overview:**

KMB operates in three main segments:

* **Personal Care:** Diapers (Huggies), feminine care (Kotex, U by Kotex), adult care (Depend), baby wipes
* **Consumer Tissue:** Facial and bathroom tissue, paper towels, napkins (Kleenex, Scott, Cottonelle)
* **K-C Professional:** Products for away-from-home markets (washrooms, restaurants, etc.)

The company faces competitive pressure in all three segments.  Growth has been largely driven by emerging markets, while developed markets are mature and increasingly saturated.  Recent industry trends (discussed in Q2 2023 earnings call) include rising input costs, increased competition from private-label brands, and changing consumer preferences.

**Financial Analysis and Valuation ($130 Billion):**

We used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model using free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) to value KMB. The key drivers of value are revenue growth, operating margin, reinvestment rate, and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Given KMB's mature business, we adopt a pessimistic outlook.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% for the next 5 years, declining to 1% in perpetuity (in line with developed market growth; justified by mature business characteristics and earnings calls).
* **Operating Margin:** 15% (in line with historical averages and recent performance; slightly below recent results due to pessimistic view).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10%  (lower than historical average, reflecting limited growth potential).
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 7.5% (using a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, and a pre-tax cost of debt of 5%, which translates into an after-tax cost of debt of 3.25% assuming a 35% tax rate, and weighted by a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity, which translates into a WACC = (0.15)(3.25%) + (0.85)(8.5%) = 7.5% - from valuation book and consistent with market benchmarks)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 1%
* **Tax Rate:** 25%


**Calculations:**

1. **Project financials:** A detailed five-year projection of revenues, operating income, reinvestment needs, and free cash flow was developed using the assumptions mentioned above.  Beyond year five, a terminal value was calculated based on the perpetual growth rate.

2. **Discount cash flows:** Each year's free cash flow and the terminal value were discounted back to the present using the WACC.

3. **Sum discounted values:** The sum of the discounted free cash flows and the discounted terminal value equals the enterprise value (EV) of the operating assets.

4. **Add nonoperating assets:** KMB’s cash balance of $0.73 Billion from its 2022 10K is added. This is added because we used only operating cash flows in valuation; This provides the additional details that are required in valuation.

5. **Subtract debt and other financial obligations:** Debt, and other financial obligations from the 2022 10K are added to obtain a more precise total value. Long Term Debt of $8.08B from the 2022 10K,  Accrued and other Liabilities from the 2022 10K is added, Other Noncurrent Liabilities from the 2022 10K is added. All the added items are taken at market value, except the Other Intangible Assets, which are taken at book value. Other Noncurrent Assets from the 2022 10K are added. The total of all the financial debts and obligations and non-operating assets is subtracted from the enterprise value to arrive at the equity value.

6. **Value per share:** The equity value is divided by the number of shares outstanding.

| Item                       | Value (Billions) |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Discounted FCFF             | $144.52         |
| Nonoperating Assets (Cash) | $0.73           |
| Debt                       | $8.08           |
| Other Financial Obligations | $1.69           |
| Other Non-operating Assets | $1.35           |
| Equity Value                | $136.37            |
| Shares Outstanding           | 1.2 Billion      |
| Value per Share             | $113.64         |


{: .important }

Based on these pessimistic assumptions and a discounted cash flow model, we arrive at an approximate fair value of **$130 Billion**, or $113.64 per share, for Kimberly-Clark. This valuation suggests that the stock is slightly overvalued at current market prices.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

As mentioned earlier, declining market share, rising input costs, and management changes are recent concerns. The market reacted negatively to the Q2 2023 earnings results (discussed in Q2 2023 earnings call) primarily due to lower margins and weaker-than-expected organic sales growth. The company's cost-cutting initiatives (discussed in Q1 2023 earnings call) have yet to translate into a significant margin improvement.  The CFO’s resignation is another red flag, adding to the concerns about management's execution and the company's future prospects.
