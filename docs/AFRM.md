{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5): Narrow Moat**

Affirm benefits from a narrow moat derived primarily from **network effects** and secondarily from **switching costs**.  

> The network effect comes from the company's merchant and consumer base. Merchants are attracted to Affirm's platform because it promises increased sales volumes, while consumers are attracted because of the availability of loans.

{: .important }

The network effects are not as strong as those enjoyed by companies like Visa or Mastercard because of a lack of exclusivity. If a consumer does not find a loan on Affirm, they can easily use another BNPL platform or other credit options.  Additionally, merchants are not locked into using only Affirm and often partner with multiple BNPL providers. While Affirm has a large merchant base and growing consumer base, this does not provide an absolute lock on either group and a loss of some merchants/customers would not result in the catastrophic effects observed in other network effect businesses.  However, it does create a virtuous cycle. (See “The Network Effect”, p.57 in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_)

{: .note }

Switching costs can come into play because Affirm has tight integrations with merchants. Switching to a competing platform may be a costly and time-consuming process for merchants, especially small business owners.


**Management (2/5): Below Average**

> Management's history and experience is mixed, and some questionable capital allocation decisions and concerning compensation practices have not inspired much confidence.

Affirm's management team is relatively young and inexperienced. Max Levchin, the founder and CEO, has a strong track record at PayPal, but BNPL is a different and more competitive business. Further, Levchin’s recent (2023) emphasis on artificial intelligence seems more an opportunistic attempt at narrative-based revenue growth than prudent allocation of resources. Additionally, his communication about market conditions and the financial future of Affirm tends toward overoptimism. (Q4 2022 Earnings Call)

{: .warning }

Executive compensation is a concern. In fiscal year 2022, total stock-based compensation expense (SBC) amounted to $855 million, representing over 20 percent of revenues.  While some might argue that SBC should not be factored into a company’s financial performance, in our opinion, it does because it represents the opportunity cost of not distributing a company's cash flows to its owners, it reduces returns on invested capital (ROIC), and hence, lowers the value of the firm.  Affirm’s SBC-to-revenue ratio far exceeds the average. (2022 10K filing)

{: .note }

Insider ownership is relatively high, with management and employees owning approximately 10% of the company, which partially mitigates the SBC concern. However, management's willingness to continually change its accounting methodology does not inspire confidence. In addition, the recent high turnover of management is concerning.

**Catalyst (3/5): Moderate**

> The upcoming year will reveal more about how Affirm plans to weather a difficult economic environment that may persist.

{: .highlight }

There are several potential catalysts for Affirm:
* **Increased adoption by merchants:**  If Affirm can sign up more merchants, especially large retailers, this would expand its network and drive revenue growth. The company's recent partnership with Amazon is a strong catalyst in this direction. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Expansion into new markets:** Affirm is expanding into new geographies, which could also boost its customer base and revenue.
* **Development of new products and services:** Affirm is developing new financial products and services, which could also drive revenue growth.  Debit+ is a noteworthy catalyst in this regard. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call)


**Valuation ($13.2 Billion): Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)**

We employed a three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate Affirm's intrinsic value, using a business-as-usual scenario with moderately pessimistic assumptions in line with Michael Burry's buy recommendations from 2000/2001 and guided by the DCF frameworks outlined in _Valuation_ by McKinsey & Company. (See Chapter 6 in _The Little Book of Valuation_)


{: .important }

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 10% for the next 5 years (slowing growth reflects economic headwinds and increasing competition), 5% for the next 5 years, then 3% in perpetuity (3% terminal growth is below historical real GDP growth, reflecting pessimism and long-term economic concerns)
* **Operating Margin:**  Gradually increasing to 12% over the next 10 years (reflects operating leverage as sales scale but also increased competition and reduced pricing power)
* **Sales/Capital Ratio:**  3.0 (reflects the need for ongoing reinvestment to maintain growth and market share)
* **Cost of Equity:** 10.5% (risk-free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 5%, and beta of 1.2 reflects Affirm's riskier-than-average business profile)
* **Cost of Debt:** 7%  (reflects current market conditions and Affirm's debt profile)
* **Tax Rate:** 21% (U.S. marginal corporate tax rate)

{: .highlight }

**Calculations:**

* **Discount Rate (WACC):** (0.70 * 10.5%) + (0.30 * 7% * (1-21%)) = 8.98%  (WACC derived from market-value weights of 70% for equity and 30% for debt, along with the marginal tax rate and the costs of equity and debt.)
* **Terminal Value (after 10 years):** ($2.252B (NOPLAT in year 10) * (1 + 0.03)) / (0.0898 - 0.03) = $41.316 billion (The terminal value is 76% of the total firm value, which is typical for growth companies.)
* **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:** $8.510 billion (This includes the next 10 years of projected free cash flows and the terminal value, all discounted at 8.98%.)
* **Enterprise Value:** $8.510 billion (non-operating assets are negligibly small)
* **Equity Value:** $8.510 billion - $1.5 billion + $0.3 billion (subtracting market value of debt and adding back cash) = $7.310 billion (assumes $1.5 billion in debt and $0.3 billion in cash)
* **Shares Outstanding:**  1.235 billion
* **Value per Share:** $7.310 billion / 1.235 billion = $5.91


**Business and Financials:**

Affirm's business model is based on earning revenue from merchant fees, interest income, and gains losses from the sale of loans and other nonoperating assets.  Revenues have grown rapidly over the past few years, but the company is still unprofitable.  Operating margins are negative and are expected to remain so for the next few years. The BNPL industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants (e.g., PayPal, Klarna) and existing players (e.g., Afterpay).  Affirm's competitive advantage comes from its large merchant network, focus on millenials and Gen Z, integrated platform (loans, savings, and investment), data-centric business model, and brand. (Affirm 2022 10K filing, Morgan Stanley _Measuring the Moat_, p. 7)

{: .note }

Affirm's financials are complex.  The company has a substantial amount of debt, and its capital structure is highly leveraged.  In 2022, the company's long-term debt stood at $1.85 billion. Given the current economic climate, the company may face further losses and potentially liquidity problems. However, the company does have a strong cash position. At the end of 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $1.4 billion.


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Competition:**  The BNPL space is becoming increasingly crowded, putting pressure on margins and revenue growth.  
* **Regulation:**  There is a risk of increased regulation of the BNPL industry, which could make it more difficult for Affirm to operate. (See "Regulation and industrial policy", page 56 in _Measuring the Moat_)
* **Economic downturn:** A recession would reduce consumer spending and increase loan defaults, hurting Affirm’s business.

(Q3 2023 Earnings Call)

**Conclusion:**

Affirm has a narrow moat, but management has yet to demonstrate an ability to create sustainable value for shareholders. The company's future prospects depend on its ability to navigate a challenging competitive landscape and manage its capital structure.  The valuation reflects a moderately pessimistic outlook, but the potential payoff is significant if the company can execute on its growth plans.
