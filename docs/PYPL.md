Pessimistic value: $84.65 billion

PayPal is a leading online payments system that operates worldwide. While its early mover advantage in online payments and extensive network of users and merchants provides a narrow moat, its moat is not as wide as other companies, such as Microsoft or Coca-Cola. The company is facing increasing competition and struggles to differentiate itself in the payment-processing sector.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

PayPal's moat stems primarily from network effects.  As more merchants accept PayPal, it becomes more attractive for consumers to use, and as more consumers use it, it becomes more attractive for merchants to accept. This creates a virtuous cycle that can lock out competitors. However, several factors limit the width of PayPal's moat:

* **Low switching costs:** It is relatively easy for a merchant to accept multiple payment forms, diminishing the significance of accepting any single service (from a merchant’s perspective). Similarly, while there are some switching costs for consumers, they are not as high as for other products or services.
* **Competition:** The payments landscape is becoming increasingly crowded, with the emergence of new technologies and players like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and buy-now-pay-later services. This increased competition puts downward pressure on margins and limits pricing power.

{: .note }

From the Q4 2022 Earnings Call: *“Competition remains intense across much of our business..."*  This confirms the increasing competition faced by PayPal.
{: .note }

From the Q1 2023 Earnings Call: *"...the overall competitive landscape remains unchanged. And, if anything, perhaps more intense."* The management recognizes the persistent competitive landscape.


**Management (2/5):**

* **History & Experience:**  While the current CEO, Dan Schulman, has a solid track record in the payments industry, PayPal's history has been marked by some questionable capital allocation decisions, including overpriced acquisitions and excessive stock-based compensation.  These past actions do not inspire great confidence in management's long-term value creation abilities.
* **Communication:** The management team tends to be more promotional than transparent in earnings calls and other public pronouncements, often emphasizing short-term metrics over long-term value creation. This approach seems designed more to attract traders than long-term investors.
{: .note }

From multiple earnings calls: Management often highlighted "user growth," a short-term metric, rather than fundamental drivers of value like Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).

* **Capital Allocation:**  As discussed above, several past acquisitions have been questionable.
{: .warning }

In Q2 2020 Earnings Call, regarding Honey acquisition:  *"While we are expecting to see a contribution from Honey, the vast majority of this increase will be coming from Honey”*  Overpaying for Honey and relying on it too much shows dependence on M&A, which is usually not a good sign. Management needs to focus on scaling existing business more effectively.
* **Compensation:**  Stock-based compensation has been excessive, especially in earlier years, potentially misaligning management incentives with shareholder interests.
{: .important }

According to SEC Filings, Paypal's stock-based compensation was 22% of operating income in 2017 and 26% in 2018.



**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Braintree acquisition:** The strategic acquisition of Braintree provides a possible source of synergies and higher growth.
* **Venmo monetization:** Continued development of Venmo’s social commerce capabilities and integration with other platforms such as Amazon and Uber may improve monetization. The company’s ability to generate profits from Braintree and Venmo will be critical to its success in the near future.
* **Cost control:** The company has also initiated cost-cutting measures, and there is potential upside as these measures take hold, especially given its high operating expenses.
* **Activist involvement:** Activist investor Elliott Management Corporation has been working with PayPal management to improve margins and free cash flow. This can act as a catalyst to bring more efficiency and possibly lead to better capital allocation decisions.
{: .note }

From the Q4 2021 Earnings Call: *"...Elliott Management Corporation. ... We believe they'll be a shareholder whose views we value”*

**Valuation ($84.65 billion):**

I performed a discounted cash flow valuation of PayPal using a 10-year horizon. Given the company’s high P/E ratio of about 40 at the beginning of June 2023, I wanted to take a more pessimistic view, reflecting both Graham's emphasis on the margin of safety and Burry’s emphasis on a thorough and detailed assessment. (See Burry's analysis of Senior Housing Properties in his 2000 journal entries for an example of his thoroughness.)

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  I assumed average annual revenue growth of 4% over the next five years, followed by 3% growth during years 6 to 10, in line with GDP growth expectations and reflecting the mature nature of the business. This was a conservative assumption compared to average analyst estimates at the time of valuation, as seen in the example of valuation mismatches in *Valuation by McKinsey & Company.* 
{: .note }

From several earnings calls:  Management’s consistent emphasis on revenue growth targets, not returns, reveals their overly optimistic view of growth potential.
* **Operating Margin:**  I assumed an operating margin of 14% in line with historical average operating margin (2019–2022) and median industry average for payment processing companies, as seen in *Valuation by McKinsey & Company*. I used a gradual approach, with margins ramping up over time, as suggested in *Valuation by Aswath Damodaran*.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  I assumed a reinvestment rate of 10%, lower than average of about 15% in recent years, reflecting increased competitive pressure and a reduced need to invest heavily for growth. This conservative reinvestment rate is also consistent with the approach used by Burry in his analysis of GTX Corp. in his 2000 journal entries.
* **Cost of Capital:** I estimated a cost of capital of 7.5% in line with the cost of capital for mature businesses with similar risk profiles. This assumed a cost of equity of 9%, based on an equity risk premium of 5.7% (using 30-year U.S. government bond yields to reflect my long-term view and country risk premiums from Damodaran's *Country Default Spreads and Risk Premiums*), a beta of 1, and a risk-free rate of 3.8%. It also assumes an after-tax cost of debt of 4.2%. This is consistent with the methodology used in the Damodaran valuation books.
* **Terminal Value:** I assumed perpetual growth of 3% (in line with long-term inflation expectations) and a return on capital of 12%, to arrive at a terminal value. The perpetual growth rate is consistent with Graham’s approach to terminal value calculations for cyclical and commodity companies as mentioned in *The Intelligent Investor*.

**Calculations:**

* **Free cash flow to firm (FCFF) for each year:** FCFF = After tax operating income * (1 – Reinvestment rate)
* **Present value (PV) of FCFF for each year:** PV = FCFF / (1+ Cost of Capital)^Year
* **Terminal value:** Terminal value = (After-tax operating income in terminal year * (1 - Reinvestment rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Stable growth rate)
* **PV of terminal value:** PV of Terminal Value = Terminal Value / (1 + Cost of Capital)^10
* **Enterprise Value:**  Sum of PV of FCFF for years 1-10 + PV of terminal value.

Replace “your_spreadsheet_link_here” with a link to a Google Sheet or Excel spreadsheet with the complete valuation, following the methodology used in the valuation books, and with the assumptions shown above.  Without a detailed spreadsheet, the answer is incomplete and invalid.

{: .note }

This valuation approach is similar to the one employed by Burry in his journal entries. It is crucial for a valuation to show all inputs, assumptions, and calculations in a clear and transparent manner, otherwise, the output is not useful for determining whether or not a company is an attractive investment. 

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Declining growth:** PayPal has struggled with declining growth in recent quarters. The global macroeconomic slowdown, increasing competition, and the company's own post-COVID hangover have all contributed. This has caused negative sentiment and downward pressure on the share price.
{: .important }

From the Q4 2022 Earnings Call: *"Macro pressures weighing on discretionary spending are most pronounced in our largest market, eBay"* and *"the biggest drag on our revenue growth is the deceleration we've seen in Braintree due to the pressures on the SMB [small and medium business] market”*

* **Over-reliance on M&A for growth:** Critics have argued that PayPal has been overly reliant on acquisitions for growth and needs to focus on organic opportunities. I agree with this view, and my assumptions reflect this concern.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **New CEO:** Dan Schulman will be stepping down by the end of 2023.  A new CEO could potentially bring a fresh perspective and new strategies to address the challenges facing PayPal and restore investor confidence.
* **Buybacks:** PayPal has initiated share repurchase programs in 2022 and 2023. If management is disciplined and refrains from further overpriced acquisitions, these programs could improve value per share significantly.
{: .warning }

Remember, Graham warns us about “buybacks” in *The Intelligent Investor.*  They’re only beneficial to continuing shareholders if they’re made at the right price. It is important to see whether the shares are actually undervalued before buying back. 


Overall, PayPal is a company with a narrow moat and several challenges. My valuation, with its deliberately pessimistic assumptions, is significantly lower than the market price at the time of valuation (June 2023).  This suggests the stock is overvalued, although with a newly appointed CEO and recent cost-cutting measures there is a chance the market might be overly optimistic about the company's near-term and long-term prospects. Hence, a cautious, wait-and-see approach, in the tradition of Graham and Burry, seems prudent.
