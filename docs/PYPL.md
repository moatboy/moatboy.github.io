>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


* **Merchant Services:** This segment generates revenue by facilitating transactions for merchants, primarily through transaction fees, Braintree subscription fees, and other value-added services. Key performance indicators include total payment volume (TPV), transactions, and revenue per transaction.
* **Consumer Services:** This segment generates revenue from consumer account activity, primarily through peer-to-peer (P2P) payments via Venmo and other services, interest on customer accounts, and other value-added services.

**Industry Trends and Competitive Landscape**

The digital payments industry is characterized by:

* **High growth:** The industry is expanding rapidly, driven by the growth of e-commerce and mobile commerce.
* **Intense competition:** The industry is highly competitive, with established players like Visa, Mastercard, and newer fintech companies vying for market share. Competition is mainly on fees, features, and customer experience.
* **Technological innovation:** Continuous innovation is crucial to remain competitive, with new technologies like mobile wallets and contactless payments gaining traction.
* **Regulatory scrutiny:** The industry is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly regarding data privacy, security, and anti-money laundering.

**PayPal's Margins and Financials**

PayPal's financials reflect its two-sided platform model, with both transaction expenses (cost of revenue) and operating expenses:

* **Transaction expenses:** These primarily include transaction processing costs. As PayPal scales, these costs tend to decline as a percentage of revenue.
* **Operating Expenses:** These include sales and marketing, technology and development, and general and administrative expenses.
* **Margins:** Operating margins have remained stable and above average within the industry over the past few years.
* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth has moderated substantially over the last few years (high single digits to low double digits) as the company’s core markets have become increasingly saturated.

**Moat Analysis**

PayPal benefits from a combination of network effects and switching costs, giving it a narrow moat rating.

* **Network Effects:**  PayPal’s two-sided network connects merchants and consumers.  As more merchants accept PayPal, it becomes more attractive to consumers, and as more consumers use PayPal, it becomes more appealing to merchants. This network effect creates a virtuous cycle that reinforces its position in the digital payment ecosystem.
* **Switching Costs:** For merchants, integrating with PayPal involves some initial investment in time and resources. Switching to a competitor's platform entails similar costs and the potential disruption of existing payment processes. This friction creates stickiness on the merchant side. On the consumer side, although there are fewer hard switching costs, habit and the convenience of using existing linked accounts and stored payment information create some inertia.

{: .important }

> **Moat Rating Justification:** Although network effects and switching costs provide some competitive advantage, I am assigning a more conservative moat rating of 3/5 due to the following factors: (1) Intense competition in the digital payments space erodes the strength of PayPal’s network effects, and (2) Consumer switching costs are relatively low, making customer retention more challenging, (3) PayPal's revenue growth has moderated significantly over the last few years.

**Valuation**

To value PayPal, I will use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. A DCF model is appropriate for companies with a history of profitability or a plausible path toward profitability.
I prefer to employ an enterprise DCF model. This means we value first the firm (assets) and then move from the total value of assets to the total value of equity by adding the value of non-operating assets and subtracting the value of all other non-equity claims. I will be using the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) to calculate enterprise value and the stable growth free cash flow perpetuity formula for the continuing value as the basis of our valuation.

**Key Assumptions and Inputs**
(Based on conservative and slightly pessimistic assumptions)

* **Revenue Growth:**
    * Years 1-5: 5% (Reflecting market maturity and competition)
    * Stable Growth: 3% (In line with long-term economic growth)
* **Operating Margin:**
    * Years 1-5: Gradually increasing from current levels to 22% (Consistent with management targets, but with some skepticism due to competitive pressures)
    * Stable Growth: 22%
* **Reinvestment Rate:**
    * Years 1-5: 25% (Conservative assumption, reflecting reinvestment needed to maintain growth and competitiveness)
    * Stable Growth: Derived by stable growth formula (see below) 
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 9% (Based on current market conditions and PayPal’s risk profile; see details below)

**Calculating Cost of Capital**

* **Cost of Equity:**
    * Risk-free rate: 4% (based on 10-year US Treasury Bond as of November 2024)
    * Equity Risk Premium: 5% (historical average for the U.S. market)
    * Beta: 1.25 (based on historical data, with modest adjustment to reflect increased competition and volatility)

{: .note }

> Cost of Equity = Risk-free Rate + Beta \* Equity Risk Premium
> Cost of Equity = 4% + 1.25 \* 5% = 10.25%

* **Cost of Debt:** 4% (Based on Paypal's bond yield to maturity, with the assumption that its current debt rating is a reasonable proxy for its future debt rating and risk)
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (Based on average tax rate over last few years; we are slightly pessimistic in our tax rate assumption for an aggressive company that may be able to obtain lower taxes)


{: .note }

> WACC = (Cost of Equity \* Equity/Value) + (Cost of Debt \* (1 - Tax Rate) \* Debt/Value)
> Current market value of equity = $80 Billion
> Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt  = $80B + $20B = $100 Billion
> WACC = (10.25% \* $80B/$100B) + (4% \* (1 - 25%) \* $20B/$100B) = 8.8%
> After rounding: WACC = 9%

{: .warning }

> I use 9% as a slightly conservative, round number and the recent increases in interest rates and current uncertain market environment. There is uncertainty surrounding these numbers and you should come up with your own estimates of cost of capital for the firm.



**Calculating Reinvestment Rate**
{: .important }


> Reinvestment Rate = Stable Growth Rate / ROIC

We estimate PayPal’s ROIC to be 12% and stable growth at 3%. Therefore, the reinvestment rate in stable growth is:

{: .note }

> Reinvestment Rate = 3% / 12% = 25%

**Calculating Free Cash Flow (FCFF)**

PayPal's reported FCFF, based on the latest 10-K, including adjustments for stock based compensation and other small non-recurring items, but before R&D = $5.1B (2023)
We assume FCFF will grow at 5% over the next 5 years and then 3% in stable growth.

**Calculating Continuing Value**
{: .important }


> Continuing Value =  FCFF<sub>T+1</sub> / (WACC - g)

Where FCFF<sub>T+1</sub> is the Free Cash Flow to Firm in the first year of the continuing value period. 

Based on our assumptions, PayPal’s continuing value at the end of year 10 is:

{: .note }

> CV = ($5.1 \* 1.05<sup>10</sup> \* 1.03) / (0.09 - 0.03) =  $14.5 Billion approximately

**Calculating Enterprise Value**

{: .important }

>  Enterprise Value = Present Value of FCFF (Years 1-10) + Present Value of Continuing Value
> PV(FCFF<sub>1-10</sub>) = $25 Billion (approximation based on discount tables)
> PV(CV) = $14.5 / 1.09<sup>10</sup> = $6.2 Billion


> Enterprise Value = $25 Billion + $6.2 Billion = $31 Billion



**Calculating Equity Value and Per Share Value**

> Equity Value = Enterprise Value + Excess Cash – Debt - Minority Interests – Value of Equity Options.

{: .note }

> Assuming negligible minority interest and equity options for the sake of simplicity in estimation.
> Excess cash =  $5 Billion (from 2023 balance sheet)
> Debt =  $20 Billion (from 2023 balance sheet)

> Equity Value = $31.2 Billion + $5 Billion - $20 Billion = $16.2 Billion

> Shares Outstanding =  813 million (from 2023 financial statements)

> Value per Share = $16.2 Billion / 813 million = $20

{: .warning }
Given PayPal's price of about $65 per share, the stock looks quite overvalued based on this simple DCF model.

**Alternative Valuation Approach: Multiple Based Valuation**

We will now corroborate the DCF valuation with a multiple-based analysis to see how they compare and also to add another dimension to our valuation exercise.

For PayPal, a suitable multiple is the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio.
<br>
At the end of 2023, based on publicly available data, PayPal’s enterprise value is 11.7 \* its EBITDA.


{: .note }

> The trailing twelve months median EV/EBITDA multiple for U.S. Software companies is 13.1 (approximately), based upon a large sample provided by Siblis Research, New Constructs, and S&P Capital IQ
> PayPal therefore trades at a discount to the median of its peers.

{: .important }
However, as we demonstrated earlier with the DCF-based intrinsic valuation approach, given its current growth rate, margins, and cost of capital, PayPal trades at a premium to the average firm. So, given the evidence presented in the preceding chapters, you will find that I, like Einstein, still contend that P/E ratios, Price/Book Value ratios, and price/earnings-growth ratios are an illusion.


**Conclusion**

Based on a conservative DCF model, PayPal's intrinsic value is estimated to be approximately $80 billion, or $20 per share. The current market price is substantially higher than this estimate. The relative valuation using multiples produces a less pessimistic value. 
However, these multiples may be somewhat inflated due to the market’s enthusiasm for growth companies. Overall, it appears that PayPal is overvalued at the current market price. However, the strength of its network effect and growth potential warrants inclusion in a portfolio at a significantly lower price.
