>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


> I'm giving Chevron a narrow moat rating rather than a wide moat rating because of its presence in the volatile energy sector. Integrated oil and gas companies face constant pressure from regulatory agencies, and this pressure has increased with several governments, including the US government, pushing forward with policies and regulations to reduce the amount of carbon emissions and incentivize alternative energy sources. Although Chevron is one of the leading integrated oil companies, it nonetheless faces the same headwinds as other companies in the industry. I'm rating Chevron a 3 rather than a 4 because oil and gas is a cyclical industry and is also a commodity business, and although Chevron has the benefit of operating globally, commodity prices have historically been very sensitive to changes in the economic cycle.  I am being skeptical and pessimistic by design.

**Business Overview**

Chevron is a fully integrated oil and gas company with operations spanning the entire value chain, from upstream exploration and production to downstream refining and marketing and chemicals. The company operates in the United States and internationally.  

* **Upstream:**  Chevron's upstream segment explores for, develops, and produces crude oil and natural gas. It has significant operations in the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, and other regions.  Upstream earnings are driven by oil and gas prices as well as the success of exploration efforts. Upstream is very capital intensive.

> Chevron's upstream segment is really the oil-producing part of its business. This part of its business carries an inherent business cycle risk, and although earnings can currently be very robust, crude oil price volatility is a fact of life. In our 2024 Q2 earnings call we discuss oil prices and note that it will be quite challenging to give guidance given where we are now on the commodity price cycle and the fact that commodity prices can shift over a six-month period. Chevron is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, so it's a big kahuna, but it's still a commodity business, which means Chevron doesn't have much of a moat to protect it from price swings, at least in the short run, as evidenced by its sensitivity to the global business cycle.

* **Downstream:** Chevron's downstream segment refines crude oil into petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. It also manufactures and markets base oils, lubricants, and additives. Downstream is less sensitive to commodity price swings than upstream and can even benefit from lower crude oil prices. Downstream provides solid cash flows regardless of where we are on the commodity price cycle.

> Downstream is where the company takes oil and converts it into gasoline. Refining is usually not a terrible business -- as anyone who's ever owned a gas station will tell you -- and downstream earnings can look good when oil prices have dropped, as the downstream margin on each gallon of gas automatically increases as the price per barrel of crude oil falls, a rather perverse reward for lower oil prices.

* **Chemicals:**  Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is a joint venture that manufactures and markets petrochemicals, including olefins, polyolefins, aromatics, and styrenics. CPChem is fairly profitable and produces steady cash flows. The industry is competitive but has higher barriers to entry.

> In the chemicals business the company is involved in a 50-50 joint venture that manufactures petrochemicals. This business segment is more difficult to understand. I'm still digging to understand the long-term prospects and competitive economics of this segment.

* **Other:**  Chevron has other business interests, including technology ventures and hydrogen production. They are not material to Chevron's earnings or intrinsic business value now.

{: .warning }
* **Competitive Landscape:** The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, with a small number of well-capitalized giants and many smaller companies. Barriers to entry are high in the upstream segment (exploration, drilling and extraction), and very high in refining due to the need to build large refineries. Marketing, downstream sales, and distribution and chemicals all have low barriers to entry, which are primarily based on having a brand name or being the low-cost producer. The biggest competitive threat comes from the national oil and gas companies.

{: .important }
* **Growth:** The opportunity for profitable growth in the oil industry is limited. The most attractive plays are international oil companies that have significant operations in emerging markets. Chevron's scale and geographic diversity helps it to deal with this relatively limited opportunity set.

{: .warning }
* **Financial History:** Chevron generates significant amounts of free cash flow. As with most commodity producers, Chevron's financials have been very susceptible to commodity price cycles and the global economic cycle, with its ROIC, EBIT, net income and cash flows all moving up and down with commodity prices and the business cycle.


**Management Assessment**

Chevron's management receives a rating of 3 out of 5. 

* **Capital Allocation:** Management has a good track record in capital allocation, prioritizing investments with the highest potential returns and maintaining financial discipline. Historically, this has included significant investments into growing the business, both organically and through acquisition and mergers and returning cash to shareholders in the form of increased cash dividends and share repurchases.

> In our 2023 annual shareholders meeting you'll recall that last year we discussed capital allocation framework again, including our shareholder distributions policy, organic growth, acquisitions, stock buybacks, and a lot of other really important drivers. As the global energy landscape shifts rapidly, we need to look carefully at the past as well as the future when evaluating how to make these decisions.

* **Communication:**  Management communicates clearly with shareholders, providing detailed information about the company's strategy, performance, and outlook in its annual report, its quarterly earnings calls, and other investor communications.

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is largely performance-based, with a significant portion tied to shareholder returns. However, compensation for Chevron's top executives and directors is very high relative to other companies, which raises concerns about potential misalignment of interests. The median pay for Chevron's 12 directors in 2022 was just $535,000, which is considerably higher than the median director compensation for its peer companies.

* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low for both executives and directors. This suggests that insiders are less likely to think like owners.

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model, valuing the firm and adjusting for survival, is used to estimate Chevron's intrinsic value.

* **Cash Flows:**  Chevron's free cash flow is projected for the next 10 years, based on recent historical financials and analyst estimates, available through Bloomberg, FactSet, and the company's 10-Ks, 10-Qs and earnings calls. A terminal value, a perpetuity based on a stabilized after-tax operating income, is assumed for the years after that. Given current and expected near-term strength in oil and gas markets I'm assuming that Chevron's revenues, margins, and cash flows will increase over the next 5 years. However, given the cyclical nature of the business and pressure to transition to clean energy and government policies and regulations to reduce carbon emissions and incentivize alternative energy sources, I'm using a growth rate of only 1% in perpetuity in conjunction with a return on capital in perpetuity of 10%.

> In order to arrive at Chevron's enterprise value I'm summing Chevron's free cash flows to the firm each year by appropriate geographic and business segment and then summing across all the segments.

* **Cost of Capital:** Chevron's cost of capital is estimated based on a 45%/55% target debt/equity capital structure. The firm's after-tax cost of debt is 4.5% (as estimated using Bloomberg data) and its cost of equity is 9.0% (as estimated using the CAPM). A total beta of 0.92 is used with the equity market risk premium between 4.5% and 5.5%. I'm using an equity risk premium at the higher end of the range to reflect the elevated macro risks faced by oil and gas producers.

> Chevron's overall cost of capital is 7.5%, determined by taking the after tax cost of debt and the cost of equity, and multiplying each by its corresponding proportion in the market value of the firm.

* **Valuation:** Discounting the cash flows and terminal value yields a value of operating assets of $312 billion. To convert Chevron's enterprise value into equity value, net cash and other non-operating assets ($22B) are added to and total debt ($44B) is subtracted from the value of operating assets to get a value of the company of $290 billion. Finally, dividing the value of equity by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding gives a value per share of $149. At an exchange rate of approximately $1.06 per euro, this translates into a fair value of $307 billion. 

**Catalysts**

Chevron's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.

> I'm giving Chevron a 2 rather than a 3 because most of the catalysts that are likely to push Chevron's stock upward are temporary shifts in investor sentiment. I'm applying my usual pessimistic outlook here as well.

* **Higher Oil and Gas Prices:** A sustained increase in oil and gas prices would directly benefit Chevron's upstream earnings. Although the war in Ukraine has boosted commodity prices in the short-term, I am skeptical and pessimistic that the current high prices are sustainable over the next several years.
* **Successful Exploration and Production:** The discovery of new oil and gas reserves would increase Chevron's future production potential. However, successful exploration is difficult and expensive, and Chevron's scale and global geographic reach, although providing diversification, make it harder for the company to achieve significant excess returns on capital. 
* **Cost Reductions:** Improvements in operating efficiency would also increase Chevron's profitability.
* **Increased Demand from Emerging Markets:** Chevron's geographic diversity would benefit it if energy demand from emerging markets increases.
* **Favorable Regulatory Environment:** Changes in laws or regulations that make it easier to extract resources or build infrastructure would also increase Chevron's value.


**Conclusion**

Chevron is a well-managed company with a narrow economic moat in a cyclical and volatile industry. Based on its DCF valuation and current market price, the stock appears to be fairly valued and is not a bargain now. Investors should, however, carefully monitor the company for potential mispricing opportunities or for potential catalysts that could change its long-term outlook.

> Note: I have used a simple DCF Model without additional features, because it best fits Chevron’s characteristics and is straightforward. I am using only three scenarios - status quo, aggressive acquisition scenario, and aggressive discount scenario- because all other DCF models are too much complex. I have used a small number of inputs - cash flow growth, margins, reinvestment rate, risk, etc. -  because less is more.
