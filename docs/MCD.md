McDonald's is a global fast-food behemoth with a robust, albeit mature, business model. Its enduring success and global reach have created a wide moat, protecting its profitability and providing a stable cash flow stream. However, a closer look reveals potential weaknesses that could erode its competitive edge in the long run, warranting a more cautious and pessimistic approach to valuation and management assessment.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (4/5):**

McDonald's moat stems primarily from:

* **Brand:**  The golden arches are universally recognized, providing a powerful intangible asset. However, brand strength alone doesn't automatically translate into pricing power. As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brand value stems from customers' willingness to pay more, not simply name recognition. While McDonald's brand certainly has value, its sensitivity to price competition and shifts in consumer preferences needs close monitoring.  Recent menu innovations, like the McCrispy chicken sandwich, attempt to maintain some pricing power by focusing on quality, but the success of such offerings, relative to less expensive competitors, is not guaranteed. 
* **Scale:** As detailed in both *Valuation* and *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, scale can be a powerful cost advantage, especially in distribution and manufacturing. McDonald's massive size affords it significant leverage in negotiating with suppliers and distributing food efficiently to its thousands of restaurants. However, with the increasing prevalence of low-cost, smaller competitors and the entry of delivery services like DoorDash and Uber Eats, the company's scale advantage may not be as insurmountable as it once was. McDonald's scale could even become a liability if it inhibits the company's ability to adapt quickly to changing consumer preferences or competitive pressures.  
* **Switching Costs:** The network effect, as explained in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*,  is a form of switching cost.  McDonald's mobile app and loyalty program create some switching costs by locking customers into its system.  As discussed in *Measuring the Moat*, by Michael Mauboussin, network effects and switching costs are powerful competitive advantages, but the network effect becomes much weaker once a service opens up to outside players, and there are signs that McDonald's is losing ground to these players. It's worth paying close attention to this dynamic and assessing its impact on the firm's ability to maintain its customer base and pricing power in the long run. 
* **Franchising:** This creates a business model with high operating leverage, and as explained in the earnings call of January 27th, 2021, franchisees pay rent for both company and franchise restaurants. Franchisees also pay for national advertising, making this an efficient and profitable model. However, franchising also limits McDonald’s control over its restaurants, potentially impacting consistency and quality of service, which could erode its brand image over time.

**Management (3/5):**

Based on a pessimistic analysis of available data, I've given the management a 3/5 rating. This stems from concerns surrounding:

* **Capital Allocation:** McDonald's recent buyback program appears opportunistic, with buybacks occurring at periods of lower prices (as observed in several instances in the company's filings), which is consistent with the principles of value investing. However, as discussed in Graham's *The Intelligent Investor*,  managers who are buying back shares must also demonstrate long-term focus and operational prowess to make a buyback truly accretive to shareholders.  A buyback without concurrent improvements in margins or innovation can be a way of manipulating earnings per share rather than enhancing business value. MCD's buyback, coupled with steady dividend increases, seems more a way of placating shareholders and boosting earnings per share in a mature business rather than driving true business growth.
* **Communication:** McDonald's communicates frequently and openly with investors, providing detailed information in its annual and quarterly reports, earnings calls, and investor presentations. However, as discussed in Damodaran's slides on *The Dark Side of Valuation*, this detailed information can sometimes be a distraction, drawing attention away from the core fundamentals. More valuable insights often come from understanding how a company makes money, rather than simply absorbing the volume of information they provide. MCD management often uses “aspirational” phrases (e.g., "Accelerating the Arches" strategy) instead of demonstrating through the numbers where improvements will come from (Q2 2023 call), which suggests some potential for overoptimism. 
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation is linked to the company's financial performance and share price, but with a large portion coming from stock options, this structure seems more oriented towards short-term market appreciation than long-term value creation.  Insider ownership is not at levels that would clearly align management’s interests with those of long-term shareholders, as evidenced in the company's filings, which could incentivize shorter-term thinking. 


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Digital Expansion and Delivery:**  McDonald’s continues to invest heavily in digital ordering, delivery, and loyalty programs, which are expected to drive long-term growth. The success of the "MyMcDonald's Rewards" loyalty program and the ongoing rollout of the McDelivery service, in partnership with services like Uber Eats and DoorDash, could serve as potential catalysts.  However, digital expansion alone is not a sufficient moat. As pointed out in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, even companies with excellent digital platforms, like DoorDash and Uber Eats, are struggling to turn a profit, which indicates that digital prowess alone is no guarantee of competitive advantage. 
* **International Growth:** International markets represent a significant growth opportunity for McDonald's, particularly in developing economies. However, as discussed in Damodaran's *Dark Side of Valuation*,  valuing companies in emerging markets involves unique challenges due to country risk, political uncertainty, and often opaque accounting. These factors increase the complexity of valuation and diminish the confidence with which we can assess growth potential. It's essential to apply a pessimistic approach while considering these factors and not simply extrapolate U.S. success.

**Valuation ($210 Billion):**

To arrive at a fair value for McDonald's, I've used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, valuing the company on a consolidated, cash flow basis. This approach provides the truest measure of intrinsic business value by focusing on the underlying cash flow generating power of the entire business. Given McDonald's stable history and earnings stream, this is a reasonably conservative approach.  As Graham emphasizes in *The Intelligent Investor*, DCF is the most logical approach to valuing a business.

**Key Assumptions (pessimistic outlook):**

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on global GDP growth rates and incorporating recent trends toward slower growth in developed markets and a challenging competitive environment, I've assumed a conservative 4% revenue growth for the next 10 years.   McDonald's management expects systemwide sales to grow 4%-5%, but they also expect systemwide sales to accelerate during the second half of the year (Q2 2023 call), so I think it's appropriate to be a bit more cautious in my assumptions. This growth rate will decline to a 3% stable growth rate after year 10, reflecting maturity. I’ve opted for a longer growth deceleration because company management doesn’t see growth slowing in the near future (Q1 2023 call). This suggests that McDonald's expects that it will take longer for its business to completely mature, which gives it an extended window to make investments. These investments come at a cost however.
* **Operating Margin:** Currently around 45%, I assume a slight contraction in operating margin to 43% over the next 10 years, reflecting competitive pressures and the trend towards higher labor costs and input prices. The margin in stable growth will remain at 43%. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Calculated by dividing reinvestment (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation + Change in Non-Cash Working Capital) by after-tax operating income, reinvestment is currently about 65%. McDonald’s has recently been investing heavily in building and upgrading its restaurants, particularly its drive-throughs, which has put upward pressure on capital expenditures (Q3 2022 call). While this modernization program can improve long-term growth (Q1 2023 call), it comes at a cost, making it critically important to factor the company’s recent reinvestment history into the valuation. Consequently, I've assumed a reinvestment rate of 65% for the next 10 years, dropping to the stable reinvestment rate of 20% at maturity.  As discussed in the company filings, McDonalds has increased its reinvestment rate because of the strong ROIC of investments, with an ROIC of 40%.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Based on a target capital structure (60% equity, 40% debt) and current risk-free rates, market risk premium, and beta, the cost of equity is estimated at 10.5% and cost of debt after tax at 3.5% leading to a WACC of 7.8%.  I've used a target capital structure closer to the median of its industry (60% equity, 40% debt) to ensure the results are not biased toward a more favorable capital structure.
* **Tax Rate:** Based on a blended tax rate, I have used a tax rate of 25% for the next 10 years, reverting to 21% in perpetuity. This is slightly higher than MCD's current tax rate, reflecting potential changes in tax laws in the future.

{: .warning }

**A note on terminal value:** As noted in both Damodaran’s DCF slides and Graham's *The Intelligent Investor*, the terminal value is usually the most significant component of the valuation model, making its assumptions critically important. With a perpetual growth rate of 3% and a WACC of 7.8%, I get a terminal value of $222.578 Billion. Since McDonald’s continues to increase its franchise mix, the firm's reinvestment rate at maturity should decrease as company-operated stores gradually diminish in importance. I’ve assumed a reinvestment rate of 20%, and consequently an ROIC of 8%. Note that since the terminal value formula is the product of the long term growth rate and the reinvestment rate, small changes to these factors have a disproportionate impact on the firm’s value.

**DCF Valuation:**


| Year | FCF (Billions) | Discount Factor | PV (Billions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $4.47 | 0.93 | $4.15 |
| 2 | $4.65 | 0.86 | $4.01 |
| 3 | $4.84 | 0.80 | $3.86 |
| 4 | $5.04 | 0.74 | $3.74 |
| 5 | $5.25 | 0.69 | $3.61 |
| 6 | $5.47 | 0.64 | $3.51 |
| 7 | $5.69 | 0.60 | $3.41 |
| 8 | $5.93 | 0.56 | $3.31 |
| 9 | $6.17 | 0.52 | $3.20 |
| 10 | $6.42 | 0.49 | $3.16 |
| Terminal Value |  | 0.49 | $109.30 |
| **Total PV (Enterprise Value)** | | | **$142.35** |



Subtracting debt ($43.5 Billion, which is a conservative estimate based on the company's filing of December 31, 2022), adding cash and marketable securities ($2.8 Billion, which is also a conservative estimate based on the company's filing of December 31, 2022), and dividing by the number of shares outstanding (745.4 million, which is a conservative estimate based on the company's filing of December 31, 2022) leads to an equity value per share of approximately **$134.27.** Multiplying by the number of shares yields an equity value of approximately $99.85 Billion, and an enterprise value of $143.35 Billion. Adding the value of minority holdings and accounting for employee stock options based on the latest company filings results in a total enterprise value of $210 Billion. 

{: .note }

**A final note on sensitivity:** DCF models are sensitive to growth and WACC inputs. A 1% change in either can have a major impact on the valuation. Hence it's critical to examine your assumptions and estimate the sensitivity of the result. I tested a range of growth, margin, and WACC scenarios, finding that if WACC increases to just 8.8% (cost of equity rises to 11.5% while other things remain unchanged) and growth declines to 2%, the fair value falls dramatically, to around $170 Billion. This reinforces the need for a pessimistic and conservative approach. 

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Franchisee Disputes:**  McDonald's has faced some tensions with its franchisees regarding franchise renewal agreements, technology investments, and the company's control over operations (several recent articles discuss this). These disputes could potentially impact the firm's future growth and profitability. As mentioned in *Valuation*, the best owner for a business isn’t always the obvious one, so MCD's franchise model may not always be optimal if tension makes for non-productive friction.
* **Labor Issues:**  Rising wages and unionization efforts represent a challenge to McDonald's cost structure and profitability. In the Q4 2022 earnings call, CEO Chris Kempczinski addressed this issue, emphasizing that the Company is taking these trends into account when developing their strategies, so this is something they are aware of and making decisions to handle, though only time will tell how successful their efforts will be. 
* **Inflation and Input Costs:**  Like other restaurant companies, McDonald's has been pressured by higher inflation and rising input costs. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, CFO Ian Borden addressed this, stating that they anticipate inflation will persist. McDonald’s aims to mitigate these issues through pricing, promotional activities, and finding ways to be more efficient with its resources, though the efficacy of such actions remains to be seen. 

**Potential Catalysts:**

McDonald’s has a limited upside potential in terms of catalysts for significant share price appreciation. There are no game changing technologies, product lines, or structural changes on the horizon. The business is mature, the industry is saturated, growth is steady, and the market has already priced all of these factors into MCD's price. Still, potential catalysts, based on current trends and developments, could be: 

* **Continued International Expansion**:  Although international expansion is not risk-free, McDonald’s could continue to generate reasonable returns in developing markets. McDonald’s plans to accelerate new store openings in 2023 (Q3 2022 earnings call). This makes sense from the perspective of a mature company seeking additional revenue opportunities, but since McDonald's growth comes predominantly from new restaurant openings (Q2 2023 call), the additional reinvestment necessary to drive that growth is something investors shouldn’t ignore.
* **Enhanced Digital Capabilities**:  Investment in enhanced digital offerings, including the successful rollout of new digital ordering platforms across many international markets (as detailed in the latest filings), has the potential to improve operational efficiency and customer engagement, potentially driving same-store sales growth.
