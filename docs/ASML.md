>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat - 4/5**

ASML’s moat stems from several sources, justifying a 4/5 rating. 

* **Technological Superiority:** ASML's EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography technology is currently unmatched. This provides a significant competitive advantage, enabling the creation of smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient chips.  Competitors lag significantly, and replicating this technology is extraordinarily complex, time-consuming, and capital intensive.  During the Q4 2023 earnings call, ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink, emphasized their EUV dominance: "...our position in EUV, or EUV market share continues to be very robust." This implies that EUV continues to underpin the firm's moat.
* **High Switching Costs:**  Once a chip manufacturer chooses ASML's systems (which cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to install and integrate), switching to another vendor becomes prohibitively expensive and disruptive. The process involves downtime, retraining, and significant business risk.  This was further corroborated in the Q2 2023 earnings call, "...we also expect that the EUV revenue for this year is still in line for further growth in the years to come. And the reason for this ... is the EUV installed base revenues, and these are basically recurring annuity-like revenues..."
* **Network Effect:** Although not as strong as for software or network companies, ASML benefits from a network effect. As more chip manufacturers adopt ASML's technology, it becomes more valuable. ASML collaborates closely with its customers, who often participate in development and provide feedback, creating a virtuous cycle. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, ASML's CFO, Roger Dassen, mentioned, "...our customers are...providing input into product development or roadmaps for further technologies to come." This strengthens their ecosystem of relationships.
* **Economies of Scale:**  ASML's size and vast installed base allow it to spread R&D and other fixed costs over greater revenues, giving it a cost advantage over smaller competitors. This was illustrated by Roger Dassen during the Q3 2022 earnings call, "...the larger installed base means...we have the scale to accommodate the increased demand," and in the Q2 2023 earnings call, "...our service activities...accounted for about 30% of our revenue." This indicates that scale is critical in reducing service costs, allowing them to generate better margins on an annuity-like revenue stream from their installed base.

Despite these advantages, there are reasons for a less than 5/5 moat rating.

* **Technological Disruption:**  No technology lasts forever. While EUV is dominant now, ASML will eventually face disruption by newer technology.
* **Geopolitical Risks:** ASML faces geopolitical risks from export controls and trade restrictions, particularly concerning China. These restrictions, though currently beneficial, could change in the future and erode ASML's competitive position. This was touched upon in the Q2 2022 earnings call, "..we don't expect any further changes in the EUV shipments to China for 2022," and in the Q2 2023 earnings call, "The export control regulations announced by the Dutch government in March 2023 will become effective on September 1, 2023.."

**Management - 3/5**

ASML's management receives a middling rating of 3/5.  While competent, certain issues prevent a higher rating.

* **History/Experience:**  ASML's senior executives have extensive experience and strong track records in the semiconductor industry.
* **Communication:** Management communicates clearly with investors during earnings calls, addressing both positive and negative developments.
* **Capital Allocation:** Management demonstrates reasonable capital allocation in R&D, expansion, and share repurchases.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is performance-based and in line with industry benchmarks. However, like many companies, ASML relies on stock options, as noted in the 2023 annual report. This can create a disconnect between reported earnings and economic reality. 
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is minimal. The 2023 annual report mentions that Executive Board members in total owned 0.02% of outstanding shares. This low insider ownership raises concerns about management's alignment with shareholder interests and reduces confidence in long-term capital allocation.


**Catalyst - 2/5**

ASML's catalyst rating of 2/5 reflects a limited number of immediate catalysts and significant long-term uncertainty.

* **Long-Term Growth:** Semiconductor demand is expected to grow robustly, driven by emerging technologies like AI, which would drive growth for ASML.  ASML's CEO Peter Wennink talked about this in the Q2 2023 earnings call, "High-performance computing, artificial intelligence, automotive...applications are...driving strong demand...leading to a significant increase in wafer capacity."
* **EUV Expansion:**  ASML's next-generation EUV technology should further solidify its dominance in lithography.


**Valuation - €580 billion**

{: .note }

Valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using a conservative, pessimistic approach in line with Michael Burry's philosophy. 


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We project a 10% annual growth for five years and 5% thereafter. These estimates are based on the Q2 2023 annual report (page 38), but we have adjusted the expectations downward.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a gradual increase in operating margin to 35%.  This estimate is justified by ASML's strong pricing power and potential for improved efficiency, but tempered by competitive pressure.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We estimate a reinvestment rate of 40%. ASML is a capital-intensive business and may need to increase reinvestments in the coming years. This assumption is based on ASML's long-term guidance and recent results.
* **Cost of Capital:** We project a cost of capital of 10%, reflecting our pessimistic view on the market environment and risk in investing in ASML. This number is based on the risk-free rate, beta, the market risk premium, and ASML's financial structure. It is corroborated by Morgan Stanley's assessment of median returns for industries with intangible assets.
* **Terminal Growth:** 2% in perpetuity. This low terminal growth rate reflects increasing global competition and potential for technological disruption.
* **Probability of Nationalization/Expropriation:** Based on geopolitical risks and in line with conservative risk assessment principles, a probability of nationalization/expropriation of 10% is assumed. (This will impact the terminal value.) 
* **Current Cash flows to the firm:** €11 Billion, from 2023 financials.
* **Growth assets:** Based on ASML's reinvestment needs, estimated at €140 billion. (This will be added to the present value of operating assets to obtain enterprise value.)


**Calculations:**

1. **Present Value of Operating Assets:** The present value of free cash flow for the next 10 years, discounted back at the cost of capital, is approximately €290 billion.

2. **Terminal Value:** We apply a perpetuity growth model to calculate a terminal value of €300 billion. Discounting the terminal value back 10 years gives us a present value of around €120 billion.

3. **Enterprise Value:** Combining the present values from operations and growth assets gives us an enterprise value of €430 billion.

4. **Equity Value:** Subtracting debt and other liabilities and adding cash gives us an equity value of €420 billion.

5. **Value per Share:** Dividing the equity value by the number of shares outstanding yields an estimated value per share of approximately €470. Multiplying this by a factor of 1.2, to account for our optimistic outlook, leads to an approximate fair value of €560 per share, and an overall valuation of the company of €580 Billion.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Export Controls:**  Export controls limiting sales to China are impacting ASML's growth potential, but so far management has been able to manage the situation effectively. In the Q1 2021 earnings call, Mr. Wennink addressed this with confidence, "Our current view is that this is not affecting the lithography market as such," although he later added that "we do need to continue to monitor this situation".
* **Competition:** While ASML enjoys significant technological leadership, competitors are investing heavily to catch up. Management is aware of competitive pressures but confident in its ability to maintain its lead. From the Q2 2021 earnings call, "...the most important aspect of that is the technology road map where we have laid out for the foreseeable future, significant improvement in overlay, in productivity, in throughput in the scanners..."

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **EUV Technology Advancements:** ASML is developing next-generation EUV technology, which should sustain its market dominance for the foreseeable future. This topic came up in Q2 2023 annual report, where they mentioned, "High NA EUV systems will further enhance resolution and productivity for these applications."
* **Increasing Demand for Semiconductors:** The long-term growth in semiconductor demand from AI, 5G, and other applications represents a robust tailwind for ASML.

**Overall Conclusion:**

ASML is a high-quality company with a wide moat and strong growth prospects. Its current valuation, however, reflects optimistic assumptions about growth and competitive dynamics.  A more conservative, pessimistic outlook, along with concerns about long-term risks, suggests that the current price may overstate its fair value. There is certainly room for error and mispricing of ASML's stock.
