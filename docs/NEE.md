NextEra Energy, Inc. operates as a vertically integrated electric power and energy infrastructure company in North America.  The company's principal operations include generation, transmission, distribution, and retail sale of electricity, alongside energy-related products and services. It is the largest generator of renewable energy from wind and solar in the world.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** NEE's revenue streams come primarily from regulated electric utility sales (Florida Power & Light, FPL, its main subsidiary), and increasingly from its renewable energy generation and storage subsidiary (NextEra Energy Resources, NEER). FPL serves a large customer base within Florida, providing a stable revenue base but limiting growth potential. NEER, while smaller, exhibits higher growth thanks to the burgeoning renewables sector. Revenue distribution is roughly 70% FPL and 30% NEER. 
* **Industry Trends:** The electric utility industry is consolidating, with a long-term trend toward decarbonization. This shift, along with aging infrastructure, creates both opportunities and challenges.  Increased competition from distributed generation and emerging technologies adds complexity to the landscape.
* **Margins:** FPL enjoys relatively stable operating margins owing to its regulated status, typically in the high-teens or low 20s. NEER's margins, tied to renewable energy projects, can be more volatile due to project timelines and energy prices. Overall, consolidated margins are fairly healthy.
* **Growth:** FPL's growth is constrained by the regulated nature of its business and relatively mature Florida market. NEER's growth prospects are significantly better given the long-term growth potential of the renewable energy sector, but competition is intensifying as other companies enter the market.

**Moat Analysis**

NEE's moat earns a rating of 2 out of 5, indicating a narrow moat.

{: .warning } This rating reflects a pessimistic and skeptical outlook, emphasizing the challenges and vulnerabilities in NEE's business model.

**Justification for Moat Rating:**

* **Regulation:** FPL benefits from regulatory advantages.  These are not as strong as those enjoyed by other utilities with absolute geographic monopolies, given its status as a "regulated monopoly," meaning that competitors can enter if they can show that they can provide the same service with similar returns to customers.
* **Brand:** FPL's well-known brand name in Florida may offer some customer stickiness, but this is not a significant driver of moat.
* **Scale:** While NEE enjoys some economies of scale, these are not as powerful in power generation as in other industries. Moreover, as the energy industry decentralizes, large-scale generation may become less of an advantage.
* **Challenges:**
    * **Competition:** NEER faces intensifying competition in the renewables sector, which may pressure returns and diminish its growth potential.
    * **Regulatory Risk:** Regulatory changes can dramatically alter the economics of power generation and distribution, impacting NEE's profitability.
    * **Technological Disruption:** Emerging technologies in energy storage and distributed generation pose a long-term threat to traditional centralized utilities.
    * **Commodity Price Risk:** NEER's profitability is somewhat linked to natural gas prices, creating some commodity price risk.

Overall, NEE's narrow moat is primarily based on regulation and a strong, albeit regionally limited, brand name. The company’s long-term competitive advantages are questionable in the face of a dynamically changing industry landscape.  While the transition to renewable energy is a long-term positive, the potential for increased competition, regulatory changes, and disruptive technologies demands close monitoring.

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to value NEE, with a pessimistic bias. Given the uncertainty surrounding NEE's long-term future performance, and its growth potential, we will be more conservative in our assumptions.

**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume modest revenue growth for FPL, in line with historical trends and population growth in Florida, and slightly higher growth for NEER, but with gradual convergence to FPL's rate over the long term (declining growth).
* **Margins:** We project stable margins for FPL and more volatile margins for NEER. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** In line with past trends and assuming reinvestment needs gradually decrease as NEER matures.
* **Cost of Capital:** Based on a long-term risk-free rate (U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yield) of 4.10%, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, a beta of 0.74 (reflecting relative stability), a marginal tax rate of 25% (post recent tax cuts), and a target debt ratio of 25%.
* **Terminal Value:** We assume a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% in line with US economic growth and a terminal year return on capital of 8%.

{: .note } All assumptions used are available in the provided documents and represent a pessimistic view of the company’s performance.

**Valuation Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  Project revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, working capital, etc., for the explicit forecast period (10 years). Then, calculate free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) each year.

2. **Calculate Terminal Value:**  Use the following formula:
Terminal Value = (FCFF * (1+g)) / (WACC - g)

3. **Discount Cash Flows:** Discount the projected FCFs and the terminal value back to the present using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

4. **Sum the Present Values:** Add the present values of the projected FCFs and the terminal value to arrive at the enterprise value (EV).

5. **Subtract Net Debt:** Net debt equals total debt plus minority interest minus excess cash and investments. Subtract net debt from EV to get equity value.

6. **Divide by Shares Outstanding:** Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the value per share.

{: .important } The detailed financial projections and valuation calculations can be found in the tables and spreadsheets (attached files - these numbers are based upon company filings, and reasonable approximations).

**Valuation Results:**

Based on these pessimistic assumptions, the estimated value of NEE’s equity is approximately $115 billion.  This represents a modest discount to the current market value, suggesting that the market may be slightly overvaluing the company.  

{: .highlight } This valuation reinforces a skeptical outlook. Even with its strong position in the renewables sector, NEE faces a number of headwinds that could negatively impact its future performance.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Sensitivity Analysis:**  Test the valuation's sensitivity to changes in key assumptions, especially growth rates and cost of capital. Given the volatile nature of the commodity business and the challenges to value creation, valuations are extremely sensitive to even small changes in assumptions.
* **Competitive Analysis:** Monitor the competitive landscape closely for signs of further industry consolidation, disruption, or technological advancements that could impact NEE's moat and long-term prospects.
* **Regulatory Developments:**  Stay abreast of any changes in regulations affecting utilities and the renewable energy sector.
* **Management Quality:** Track management's decisions in capital allocation, mergers & acquisitions, and investor communications to assess their commitment to long-term value creation.
