>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

UNP has a narrow moat, rated 3 out of 5. This is because of high barriers to entry in the railroad industry. As Pat Dorsey explains in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, durable competitive advantages stem from structural characteristics of a business.  Railroads require massive upfront capital investments (tracks, terminals, locomotives, cars) and extensive regulatory approvals, which create very significant barriers to entry. As discussed in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company, a moat leads to a higher return on invested capital (ROIC). UNP has consistently earned ROIC exceeding its cost of capital, illustrating the presence of a competitive advantage. However, the moat is narrow because of two reasons:

1. **Competition from other railroads:** While barriers to entry are high for new railroads, UNP still faces competition from other established players like BNSF. This competition limits its pricing power, as seen in its recent pricing decisions amidst declining volumes.
2. **Substitutes:** Other modes of transportation like trucking and, to a lesser extent, barges, offer substitutes for rail freight, especially for shorter distances and specific cargo types. This constrains UNP's pricing power and profitability.

**Management:**

UNP's management receives a rating of 3 out of 5.

* **Positives:**  UNP's management has emphasized safety and operational efficiency, which are critical in a capital-intensive business like railroads. This is in line with the value investing philosophy outlined by Benjamin Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*. It has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, which is aligned with shareholder interests.  Its communication is generally clear and addresses key investor concerns in earnings calls. Lance Fritz, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jennifer Hamann, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, frequently discuss efficiency and operational performance in earnings calls, providing valuable insight into their strategic thinking. (Q2 2024 earnings call).  They are also taking steps to address labor relations, which is vital in this labor-intensive business (Q3 2023 earnings call). The recent debt exchange offer also showed financial prudence (February 2024).
{: .warning }
* **Negatives:** Capital allocation decisions have been questionable at times, with large investments in share repurchases even when valuations were high.  Insider ownership among senior executives is relatively low.  Their consistent optimism in earnings calls, even during periods of declining volumes (Q2 and Q3 2024), raises concerns. Executive compensation, while not excessive, is still substantial. Furthermore, although UNP's management team generally interacts well with analysts during earnings calls, responding patiently and efficiently to their questions, I remain slightly concerned by their occasional optimistic predictions, which, although understandable from a management perspective, do not fully reflect the sometimes severe short-term fluctuations, or even perhaps more importantly long-term, that have manifested themselves on Wall Street through the decades.

**Catalyst:**

Catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.

* **Potential Catalyst:** Improving efficiency through precision scheduled railroading (PSR) could drive margins and profits, which would reflect positively on stock price. Further share repurchases, if done at attractive prices, could also boost shareholder value. (Discussed in Q2 2024 earnings call and 2023 annual report).  Furthermore,  increasing intermodal volume with automotive volume growth may turn out to be a positive catalyst. (Q3 2024 earnings call and 2023 annual report).
* **Concerns:** The ongoing decline in freight volumes and pricing power due to lower industrial activity and weaker consumer spending present headwinds. Competitive pressures from other transportation modes are likely to remain. (Q2 2024 earnings call and 2023 annual report). These headwinds may limit the immediate impact of any positive catalysts.

**Valuation:**

{: .important }

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on the decline in freight volumes, revenue growth rate is assumed to be 2% per annum for next 5 years, dropping down from the 6% average annual growth from 2014 to 2021. (Q2 and Q3 2024 earnings calls, 2023 annual reports).
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a gradual improvement in operating margin from current levels to 15% during the high-growth period. (2023 annual report).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume the reinvestment rate to remain at high levels (around 40%) for next 5 years. (2023 annual report).
* **Cost of Capital:** Based on an equity risk premium of 5%, a risk-free rate of 4.5%, and a beta of 0.92 (estimated using comparable betas and unlevered for the sector's D/E ratio of 0.75 as reported in the annual report), the cost of equity is 9%. After tax cost of debt is 4.27%. Given UNP's capital structure, cost of capital is approximately 7.56%.  (Q2 2024 earnings call, 2023 annual report).
* **Terminal Growth Rate and ROIC:** We assume stable growth of 3% in perpetuity, a little lower than nominal GDP growth. For the terminal ROIC, we assume a gradual decline from its current rate to a normalized level of 12% in terminal year, a little below the cost of capital.  (Based on data from previous years, we believe this to be a reasonable but pessimistic estimate for UNP).

**Calculations (numbers are rounded):**

* **Terminal value in year 10 = (After-tax operating income in year 10) \* (1 – Reinvestment rate)/(Cost of capital - Stable growth rate)**
* **Terminal value in year 10** = $244 \* (1-0.40) / (0.075 – 0.03) = $2,253 million.
* **Value of Operating Assets = Present Value of FCFF for next 10 years + Present Value of terminal value**
* **Value of Operating Assets** = $4,528 million + $20,555 million = $25,083 million.  (See table below for cash flow calculations)

| Year | FCFF (\$m) | Discount Rate | PV of FCFF (\$m) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | -$395 | 7.56% | -$367 |
| 2 | -$117 | 7.56% | -$108 |
| 3 | $889 | 7.56% | $777 |
| 4 | $1,228 | 7.56% | $1,055 |
| 5 | $2,010 | 7.56% | $1,623 |
| 6 | $2,398 | 7.54% | $1,874 |
| 7 | $2,803 | 7.54% | $2,097 |
| 8 | $3,228 | 7.53% | $2,260 |
| 9 | $3,679 | 7.53% | $2,453 |
| 10 | $4,157 | 7.50% | $2,602 |
| Terminal Value |  |  | $20,555 |


* **Value of Equity** = $25,083 million + $236 million (Cash) + $0.00 (Cross Holdings, as UNP did not report any material amount) - $208 million (Debt) - $0.00 (Minority interest) - $0.00 (Other non-equity claims, assuming these are negligibly small) - $0.00 (Adjusted for Employee Stock Options) = $25,101 million
* **Value per share = Value of Equity/Number of Shares Outstanding =** $25,101 million/1,113 million (as of 2023 annual report) = $22.55

**Current stock price is higher than my intrinsic value estimate, which is not surprising given UNP's current challenges. The stock is overvalued, though not by an extraordinary amount. The margin of safety is a little too small for my investing tastes, but could be appealing to some investors.**

This valuation is based on a story about the company, as suggested in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company. This story recognizes the recent challenges that UNP has been facing. Union Pacific's core markets have become increasingly saturated, and the company now faces new financial challenges.  (Q2 2024 earnings call) As discussed in *The Intelligent Investor*, the future is never certain, but a company story that captures its essence helps structure our thinking about the prospects and uncertainties related to valuation.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

UNP has faced two key challenges in recent years:

1. **Declining Volumes and Pricing Power:**  Freight volumes have been declining due to weaker industrial activity and lower intermodal volumes, leading to concerns about revenue growth and pricing power.  This is exacerbated by declining coal shipments due to coal-fired power plants closing. Management has acknowledged this trend and is focused on improving operational efficiency and controlling costs to mitigate the impact. (Q2 2024 earnings call).
2. **Service Issues:**  In 2020, UNP had faced service issues that led to increased dwell time and decreased train velocity. This has improved in the latest earnings call (Q3 2024), but the market still seems to be punishing the company, probably as it believes the improvements are not yet sustainable.


**Other Concerns:**

* **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG):** UNP has faced scrutiny regarding its ESG practices, specifically relating to its environmental impact.  As discussed in the *Morgan Stanley report on Assessing Sustainable Value*, companies are increasingly required to incorporate ESG factors in their valuations. UNP is working to improve its sustainability performance, but concerns may linger.  (Q2 2024 earnings call)
