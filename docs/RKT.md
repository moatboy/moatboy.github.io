Rocket Companies operates in a fiercely competitive mortgage industry, offering home loans and related services. While the company has achieved significant scale and brand recognition, its business model is easily replicable, earning it a **narrow moat rating of 1/5**. This low rating reflects the lack of sustainable competitive advantages that can protect its profits from competition in the long run. The mortgage industry's profitability is heavily influenced by interest rates and macroeconomic factors, not company-specific advantages.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Management receives a 2/5 rating**, primarily due to concerns about capital allocation and strategic direction. While the executive team possesses significant industry experience, their aggressive growth strategy, fueled by debt and acquisitions during times of low interest rates, raises questions about long-term value creation for shareholders.  Furthermore, their emphasis on marketing spend and expansion into adjacent businesses like personal finance raises questions about their ability to translate these investments into sustainable profits.

> Rocket’s heavy reliance on debt during a period of historically low interest rates has created a substantial risk for shareholders. As interest rates rose, the company's profitability declined sharply, and its aggressive acquisition strategy has not yet yielded significant returns.  Furthermore, the shift in consumer preference towards purchasing mortgages online presents a real threat to Rocket's predominantly broker-based business model. 

**Catalyst rating is 2/5**.  The mortgage industry's cyclical nature creates the potential for substantial upside if interest rates fall and refinance activity picks up. However, the shift towards online mortgage origination poses a significant threat and diminishes the likelihood of a quick recovery for Rocket.  A successful integration of its recent acquisitions and a shift towards more sustainable, less debt-fueled growth could be catalysts, but their impact remains uncertain.

**Valuation Methodology and Assumptions:**

A three-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used to value Rocket Companies. A three-stage DCF is appropriate for cyclical companies like Rocket, allowing for different growth rates across different time periods in the future. 

* **Stage 1 (2024–2028):** This stage models a turnaround in the business. Revenue growth and operating margins are projected to increase to 5 percent and 14 percent, respectively, with revenue growth being based on GDP plus inflation. 
* **Stage 2 (2029–2033):** This stage captures the transition from current performance to long-term performance. Revenue growth and operating margins are projected to decline to 4 percent and 12 percent, respectively. 
* **Stage 3 (2034–Forever):** This is the terminal period. Revenue growth is assumed to be 3 percent, equal to the inflation rate in perpetuity. The operating margin is assumed to be 10 percent, at the lower end of historical levels.
* **Cost of Capital:** Rocket’s WACC is estimated at 12 percent, higher than its historical average, given the increased risk profile of its business in 2024 as compared to previous years.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** The reinvestment rate is tied to the return on new invested capital (RONIC). This is a better measure than return on equity or return on capital.
* **Terminal Value:** The company's terminal value is $6 billion. The perpetuity growth method is used to calculate the terminal value, using cash flows, growth rate and ROIC from 2033. This is the most appropriate method.


**Valuation Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue Growth | Margin | EBITDA | Reinvestment Rate | FCF | Discount Rate | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2024 | 5% | 14% | \$310 | 50% | \$155 | 12% | \$138 |
| 2025 | 5% | 14% | \$326 | 50% | \$163 | 12% | \$130 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 2033 | 4% | 12% | \$460 | 40% | \$276 | 12% | \$150 |
| Terminal Year | 3% | 10% | \$474 | 33% | \$317 | 12% | \$6,000 |


Discounting the free cash flows and the terminal value at the cost of capital leads to an enterprise value of $7 billion. Deducting debt and adding cash from Rocket’s latest balance sheet, and dividing by the diluted number of shares outstanding, yields a per-share value of $8.12.

> These calculations are presented only to illustrate the valuation model, using a five-year explicit forecast period. Actual numbers may vary due to additional complexity in a real-world situation (such as additional non-operating assets, cross holdings, etc.).

**Business Overview:**

Rocket operates primarily in the United States, providing mortgage origination, title, appraisal, settlement services, real estate agent referrals and home search tools under their Rocket Homes business. The industry is highly fragmented, and the shift to online mortgage origination has intensified competition. Rocket differentiates itself through its technology platform, aiming for a seamless customer experience. However, this advantage is eroding as competitors invest in similar technologies.

**Financial Analysis:**

Rocket's financials reflect the highly cyclical nature of the mortgage industry. The company's revenues and profitability have been highly volatile in recent years, driven by fluctuations in interest rates. Rocket's recent acquisitions have not yet translated into substantial profit growth, and its high debt levels make it vulnerable to rising interest rates.

> From the Q3 2022 Earnings Call: "Our closed loan origination volume, our gain on sale margin, and our rate lock volume, all declined quarter over quarter. While industry originations also declined quarter over quarter, Rocket’s gain on sale margin pressure outpaced those trends. As of today, Rocket Money has 17 million verified users on its platform... We are well on our way towards our goal of having 20 million verified users on the Rocket Money platform by the end of 2023...The combination of a significant industry wide spread, plus Rocket’s ability to gain share, plus Rocket’s cost structure will prove to be an extremely powerful driver of earnings in quarters to come"

**Recent Developments & Concerns:**

Rocket has been navigating a challenging environment due to rising interest rates, declining mortgage originations, and increasing competition from online lenders. The company has undertaken cost-cutting measures and is focusing on expanding into adjacent businesses. However, these efforts have yet to yield significant results.

> From the Q4 2023 Earnings Call: "... in 2024, we expect a larger portion of our total revenue (excluding interest on Ginnie Mae and government loans) to come from our gain on sale of mortgage loans sold into the secondary market and our gain on sale of other loans and from related servicing income, with an estimated range of 80% to 83% in 2024."


**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Decline in Interest Rates:** A significant decline in interest rates could stimulate refinancing activity and boost Rocket’s mortgage origination business.
* **Successful Integration of Acquisitions:** If Rocket can successfully integrate its recent acquisitions and achieve cost and revenue synergies, it could improve profitability.
* **Shift to a More Sustainable Growth Model:** A move away from debt-fueled growth and towards a more sustainable model could improve investor confidence.
* **Innovative New Products/Services:** The development and successful launch of innovative products and services could differentiate Rocket from its competitors.

However, the presence of these catalysts does not guarantee success, and their impact is difficult to predict with certainty. A value investor should thoroughly analyze the company's financial, strategic, and competitive position before deciding if a purchase at the current share price represents a satisfactory margin of safety.  Given the numerous risks and challenges, a cautious approach is recommended.
