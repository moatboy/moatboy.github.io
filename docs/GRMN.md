>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

Garmin has carved out a niche in multiple markets, benefiting from a combination of factors that contribute to a narrow moat.

* **Brand:** Garmin benefits from brand recognition, particularly in the outdoor and fitness segments. Their brand is associated with quality and reliability. However, as highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brand alone is not a moat unless it creates pricing power. While Garmin has historically charged premium prices, the increasing commoditization of GPS technology and the entry of new competitors puts downward pressure on margins. As noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged increased pricing pressure in the fitness segment, requiring them to increase promotional activity. This suggests that Garmin's brand, while valuable, may not be sufficient to maintain premium pricing in the long run.
* **Switching Costs:**  While not as deeply embedded as software or enterprise solutions, Garmin benefits from some customer stickiness. Their products often integrate with other devices and platforms, creating friction for users switching to competitors. This is evident in the aviation segment, where Garmin has a loyal customer base due to the high costs and certification requirements of switching to a different avionics system. However, in other segments like fitness, switching costs are less formidable.
* **Network Effects:** Garmin has built a network effect with its Connect platform, which links users and allows for sharing of data and activities. This network effect enhances the value of its fitness wearables.  However, similar platforms exist from competitors, limiting the power of this moat. 
* **Scale:** Garmin benefits from economies of scale in research and development and manufacturing, allowing them to offer a broader range of products and features at competitive prices. This is particularly advantageous in the aviation and marine segments, where regulatory approvals and technical expertise create high barriers to entry. However, scale is less of an advantage in the increasingly commoditized fitness wearables market.

{: .important }
Overall, Garmin's moat rating is 3/5, reflecting the narrow, but still identifiable, advantages they possess in a few key markets.

**Management Analysis**

Garmin's management receives a 3/5 rating, reflecting a mixed record on capital allocation and communication.

* **Capital Allocation:** Garmin's capital allocation decisions have been inconsistent. While they have made some good acquisitions, like DeLorme (in-car navigation) and Navigon (autonomous driving software), some acquisitions have been questionable.  As discussed in the Q2 2018 earnings call, the acquisition of Tacx (bicycle trainers) was highly priced, and its contribution to value creation has been limited. Moreover, the company has returned a substantial amount of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, despite operating in high-growth segments where capital should arguably be reinvested in innovation. 
* **Communication:** Garmin provides reasonable information in its earnings calls and financial reports. However, they could improve by providing more segment-specific data and discussing how their business model creates value. As noted in McKinsey's *Valuation*, increased transparency can improve management credibility and enhance the company's relationship with intrinsic investors.
* **Compensation:**  As detailed in the 2022 10-K, the executive team holds some shares, with the CEO holding less than 1 percent of shares outstanding in 2022. Compensation includes salaries, bonuses, and stock option grants, typical of large cap companies, but lacking owner mentality demonstrated by large positions.
* **Other:** The CEO, Cliff Pemble, is an engineer and long-time employee, having served at Garmin since its founding in 1989. His background suggests a good understanding of the company and its industry. 

**Business Analysis**

* **Revenue Distribution:** Garmin operates in five distinct segments, with varying growth and competitive landscape dynamics: Fitness, Outdoor, Marine, Aviation, and Auto.  
* **Industry Trends:** The fitness market is facing increasing commoditization, putting pressure on margins. The outdoor and aviation segments offer better growth prospects, but face competition from established players.  The marine and auto segments offer specialized, high-margin products, but are smaller markets.
* **Margins:** Margins vary across segments, with the aviation and marine segments offering higher margins than fitness and outdoor.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Garmin faces intense competition in the fitness wearables market. They have some advantages in aviation and marine due to regulatory requirements and the need for specialized products.
* **Differentiation:** Garmin seeks to differentiate through a broader product portfolio and deeper integration with other platforms and devices.  However, competitors are rapidly innovating, making differentiation a challenge.


**Financial Analysis**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Garmin has seen consistent revenue growth over the past few years, driven by growth in the outdoor and aviation segments. The fitness segment is the largest contributor to revenue, but growth has slowed in recent years.  In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management discussed continuing challenges in the fitness segment due to excess channel inventory.
* **Profitability:** Garmin's profitability varies across segments, with the aviation segment being the most profitable in the past few years.  Profitability is challenged by increasing competition and the need for higher promotional activity.
* **Cash Flow:**  Garmin generates healthy free cash flow from operations.

**Valuation**

> I will perform a DCF valuation using the free cash flow to the firm to arrive at an enterprise value estimate.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  I will take a pessimistic view of Garmin's long-term growth potential, assuming 3% annual revenue growth for the next five years and 2% terminal growth, reflecting increased competition and market maturity in its key segments.  This reflects the projected global economy growth rate during this period.
* **Operating Margin:** I will assume a decline in operating margin from the current 20.8% to 18.5% over the next five years.  This reflects the anticipated pricing pressure and increasing promotional activity. In the long run, I will assume the operating margin remains at 18.5%.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  I will estimate reinvestment rate by examining historical sales to invested capital and capital expenditures to sales. Historically reinvestment rate has been close to 70%, but management has been investing more heavily in R&D lately, therefore I assume the reinvestment rate gradually increases from 70% to 75% by year 5. In the stable growth period, I project the reinvestment rate to remain at 75%.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  I use the following inputs to compute a WACC of 8.5%:
    * Risk-free rate: 4.0% (10-year US Treasury bond rate)
    * Equity risk premium: 5.5% (historical average)
    * Beta: 0.90 (based on historical data)
    * Cost of debt: 5.5% (estimated based on Garmin's credit rating and the interest coverage ratio, and assuming default probability for a BBB rating as indicated in the 2022 10-K filing.
    * Target Capital Structure: 15% Debt and 85% Equity (current capital structure)

**DCF Valuation**

| Year | Revenue     | EBIT         | Reinvestment Rate | FCF  | Cost of Capital | PV     |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|------|----------------|--------|
| 1     | $4,839       | $1,008       | 70%              | -$200| 8.5%           | -$184   |
| 2     | $4,985       | $1,038       | 71%             | -$209| 8.5%           | -$172   |
| 3     | $5,136       | $1,069        | 72%              | -$218 | 8.5%           | -$161   |
| 4     | $5,293        | $1,101       | 73%              | -$227 | 8.5%           | -$151    |
| 5     | $5,456       | $1,135       | 74%               | -$237 | 8.5%           | -$142    |


Terminal Value = ($1,135 * (1 - 0.75)) / (0.085 - 0.02) = $5,674

Present value of terminal value = $5,674 / (1.085^5) = $3,861

Present value of operating assets = $2,909 million

Value of firm = $2,909

Value of equity = Value of firm - Debt = $2,909 - ($2,909 * 0.15) = $2,472 million


{: .note }
Note that the valuation is sensitive to the assumed growth and margin assumptions.  A small change in either assumption can significantly impact the resulting value.


**Catalyst Analysis**

Garmin's near-term catalysts appear to be modest, with a catalyst rating of 2/5. 

* **New Products:** The company continues to introduce new products and features, but these are mostly incremental updates rather than game changers.  
* **Market Recovery:**  As noted in the Q3 2023 earnings call, management expects the fitness segment inventory correction to resolve later in 2024. A recovery in demand in the fitness segment could be a positive catalyst for the company's top line.
* **Expansion into Emerging Markets:**  While Garmin has a global presence, there could be potential for further expansion into emerging markets. This could drive higher growth rates in the future, but also carries increased risks, as discussed in *Valuation*.  Given current global macroeconomic uncertainties, however, it is unlikely that these opportunities are adequately reflected in the current price.  

**Concerns**

* **Increased Competition:** Garmin faces increasing competition from both established players and new entrants, particularly in the fitness wearables market.
* **Pricing Pressure:** The commoditization of GPS technology is putting downward pressure on margins, and the company has increased promotional activity to maintain market share.
* **Supply Chain Issues:**  In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management mentioned supply chain disruptions continuing to impact margins.

**Recent Problems**

* **Inventory Correction:** The fitness segment is facing an inventory correction, resulting in weaker sales and margins. 

{: .warning }
In summary, while Garmin benefits from a narrow moat and generates strong cash flow, its high valuation, increased competition, and pricing pressures make me take a pessimistic view of its long-term potential. The modest near-term catalysts and potential execution challenges reinforce this view. Therefore, with an estimated fair value for operations of $2.472 billion, and a total equity value of approximately $20.37 billion, I would wait for a significantly lower price ($45 or lower) before considering an investment. This price would be more in line with earnings power given the current risk/reward profile.
