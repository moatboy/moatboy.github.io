{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

JCI's moat is narrow and based primarily on **switching costs** and the **intangible asset** of its brand. The company benefits from long-standing customer relationships, particularly in building management systems, where the complexity and cost of switching to a competitor’s system can be prohibitive. As mentioned in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_, these switching costs are a form of mini-monopoly, allowing JCI to extract more money from its customers.  This is evident in JCI’s consistent record of profitability and market share, as outlined in multiple company investor presentations. However, JCI's moat is weakening. The industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with technological advances and new entrants eroding some of JCI's traditional advantages.  This competitive pressure, as detailed in _Competitive Advantage_, can be seen in the declining profitability of building automation, as discussed in the Q1 2023 earnings call. Furthermore, JCI's business model has a higher proportion of undifferentiated commercial offerings (HVAC), compared to more differentiated industrial offerings (refrigeration, fire & safety).

>“Now we are moving into a world where customers are in charge. I would say the HVAC industry was traditionally underserved by brands. Everybody felt it was just a commoditized product, and therefore why would you pay a premium?” -- Chairman and CEO George Oliver in the Q4 2022 earnings call.

**Management (3/5):**

{: .warning }

Management's compensation structure, including stock options and performance-based awards, could potentially incentivize short-term decision-making, as outlined in _The Essays of Warren Buffett_. While JCI states that long-term shareholder value creation is a primary goal, there's always a risk of misalignment.

{: .note }

Furthermore, while there is insider ownership, with senior managers and directors owning portions of the company, as shown in every 10-K, the amount of ownership of outside investors is significantly higher. 

JCI’s management has a mixed track record. On the positive side, Oliver has overseen some cost-cutting initiatives and portfolio adjustments that improved margins and returns on capital, as detailed in the company’s 2021 investor relations presentation. Oliver also clearly explains complex concepts such as EBITDA margins to shareholders, as seen in the Q3 2022 earnings call. However, there are also potential issues, which is consistent with a company in the maturity phase of its company life cycle, as explained in _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies_. While the company claims it did not participate in cyclical excesses, as seen in their annual and quarterly reports, it has faced several significant write-downs, including goodwill impairments, primarily due to overpaying for acquisitions, as seen in the company’s financials. JCI also has faced legal challenges, as outlined in JCI's quarterly and annual reports, including Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, including allegations of alleged financial misrepresentations and cybersecurity issues, as mentioned in their 10-K filing.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

JCI’s most significant potential catalyst is the **ongoing industry consolidation**, as discussed in the 2021 10-K, which could lead to further acquisitions or a takeover of JCI itself. Given the fragmented nature of the industry, as pointed out in _Competitive Advantage_, a strategic acquisition by a larger player, with JCI itself as a target, could unlock substantial shareholder value, especially if executed at an opportune price.  

>“I am an eager reader of whatever Phil has to say, and I recommend him to you.”
>--Warren Buffett, about Philip Fisher, from Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings.


Additional potential upside catalysts include successfully integrating recent acquisitions, further margin expansion through cost-cutting measures, and leveraging its global presence to capitalize on new market opportunities, especially in the Asia-Pacific Region, where the company generated 27 percent of its revenue in fiscal year 2022.

**Valuation ($44.5 Billion):**

The valuation is based on a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, employing an enterprise DCF approach, which is more difficult but provides a more robust valuation, as described in _Valuation_.


**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  The company had annualized revenue growth of 11.3 percent in the last year and 12.3 percent in the last three years. We will assume a more modest 3 percent revenue growth over the next five years for all of JCI's business segments (products, solutions, and global products), with a return to a more sustainable growth trajectory thereafter.
* **Margins:** JCI's operating margin (EBIT/Sales) has averaged around 10 percent annually over the last three years and recently rose from 8.8 percent in 2020 to 12.1 percent in 2022.  We assume operating margins gradually revert to about 11 percent (11 percent EBIT margin) for all segments of the business in the terminal period.
* **Reinvestment:** JCI has been reinvesting around 40 percent of its after-tax operating income in recent years. We will assume reinvestment declines over time to a terminal rate of 26.7 percent.
* **Discount Rate (WACC):** I estimate JCI’s WACC to be about 7.6 percent. This is based on a risk-free rate (10-year US Treasury bond) of 3.39 percent, a market risk premium of around 4.5 percent, and a beta of 0.92. I obtained these numbers from the resources provided. JCI also generates the majority of its income from North America (54%), and the majority of its global profits (89%) from North America, according to their 2022 10-K, with a small proportion of its business coming from Europe and Latin America.

{: .note }

**Caveat:**  For a cyclical company like Johnson Controls, the results of any DCF analysis are highly dependent on the analyst’s assumptions about growth, margins, and reinvestment. The most difficult task is forecasting how much JCI will invest into its business and how much cash the company will eventually generate on those investments.


**Calculations:**


1. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value after 10 years, as explained in _Valuation_, can be derived from a perpetual growth model.
Terminal Value = (EBIT in year 11 * (1 - reinvestment rate)) / (WACC - g)
   = ($5,412 * (1-.267) / (.075 - .03) = $87,704 million

2. **Present Value of Cash Flows:**  The present value of cash flows from the first 10 years is approximately $16,832 million.

3. **Enterprise Value:** The sum of the present value of cash flows and terminal value.
Enterprise Value = $16,832 + $87,704 = $104,536 million


4. **Equity Value:** Enterprise value minus debt plus cash. JCI's debt-to-capital ratio was 14.3% in 2022. The value of cash, as reported in their 2022 10-K, was $860 million.  Debt was $4,356 million. We obtain these figures directly from the provided financials.
Equity Value = $104,536 - $4,356 + $860 = $101,040 million

5. **Per Share Value:** Divide equity value by the number of shares outstanding. As shown in their 2022 10-K, there are 2,235 million shares outstanding.
Value per share = $101,040 / 2,235 = $45.2 per share. 
Based on JCI's share price of $58 (as of 8/1/2024), the current value of the firm can be estimated as being around $44.5B

 **Concerns and Controversies:**

{: .important }

One significant concern for JCI revolves around margin compression. Increasing competition and supply chain disruptions during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed in Q2 2022, Q3 2022, and Q4 2022 earnings calls, have hampered growth and reduced margins in certain segments.  Also, as noted in the Q2 2023 and Q3 2023 earnings calls, there is continued concern about the macroeconomic outlook and commercial HVAC demand.

{: .note }

A second recent concern raised by analysts in recent earnings calls is its exposure to high-growth markets. While such expansion could be good for growth and profitability, as pointed out in _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies_, it also introduces political, regulatory, and macroeconomic risks, as noted in _The Little Book of Emerging Markets_, that could potentially hinder the company's performance. JCI increased its exposure to these markets through its 2022 acquisition of Fire & Security Products (FSP) from Hitachi. However, the company assures, it expects to earn adequate returns in the long run.



JCI’s exposure to Europe has also been mentioned as a concern by some analysts in recent earnings calls, given the potential for economic slowdown in the region. Management, however, sees Europe as a long-term play, as mentioned in the Q2 2023 and Q3 2023 earnings calls. These concerns are factors in adopting a slightly pessimistic outlook for its valuation.


**Potential Catalysts and Rating:**
JCI does not have any upcoming significant catalysts.

Some potential future catalysts include increased government spending on infrastructure projects, and the company could also increase its exposure to high growth markets.
