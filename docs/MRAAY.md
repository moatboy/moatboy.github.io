>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


### Moat

MRAAY's moat is narrow, earning a rating of 2 out of 5.  This is because while the company benefits from some scale advantages and brand recognition, the downstream energy industry is inherently competitive. There are low barriers to entry in many segments, particularly in retail gasoline sales. Differentiation is primarily based on price and convenience, which can be easily replicated by competitors.  Furthermore, MRAAY faces regulatory risks, especially concerning environmental regulations, which could negatively affect profitability.

>
> As Aswath Damodaran discusses in *The Little Book of Valuation*, competitive advantages matter most in industries where price isn't a large part of the customer's purchase decision. In the downstream energy sector, price is often the primary driver for consumers, which limits MRAAY's pricing power and therefore its moat.

### Management 

MRAAY's management earns a rating of 3 out of 5. This rating reflects a mixed assessment.

* **Positives:**  Management has a record of delivering shareholder returns and has been active in share repurchases.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management highlighted their commitment to returning 50% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, which indicates a shareholder-friendly approach. They also have made some successful acquisitions, including Andeavor in 2018, which expanded their geographic reach and increased refining capacity.
* **Negatives:** Management's capital allocation decisions have not always been consistent. For instance, MRAAY's expansion into retail via the Speedway acquisition has not generated the returns initially expected, as acknowledged by management in the Q2 2023 earnings call. The company's profitability has also been impacted by rising costs and regulatory pressure, which raises questions about management's ability to adapt to a changing environment. Additionally, executive compensation has been a source of some controversy, potentially creating a misalignment of incentives.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged the challenges posed by rising costs and regulatory pressure, but offered limited detail on how they would adapt to these challenges.

> As Pat Dorsey emphasizes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, great management isn't enough for long-term competitive advantage.  MRAAY's management seems capable, but their track record is not consistently exceptional enough to warrant a higher rating.  Furthermore, like the Janus example cited in the book, even well-managed companies can struggle in the face of unfavorable industry economics.

### Business

MRAAY operates in a cyclical and competitive industry.  Its businesses can be broken down as follows:

* **Refining:**  MRAAY is one of the largest independent refiners in the US.  The profitability of refining is driven by crack spreads (the difference between crude oil prices and refined product prices).  These spreads are volatile and subject to macroeconomic factors.
* **Retail:** MRAAY operates a large network of retail gas stations under the Speedway, Marathon, and ARCO brands.  As noted earlier, competition in retail gasoline is intense, and margins are thin.  
* **Midstream:** MRAAY owns and operates pipelines and other midstream assets. This segment offers more stable cash flows than refining or retail.

Key trends impacting the industry include:

* **Environmental regulations:** These are increasingly stringent, adding costs and complexity.
* **Electric vehicles:** The increasing adoption of EVs presents a long-term threat to gasoline demand.
* **Global economic growth:**  This drives demand for refined products.

### Financials

MRAAY's financials reflect the cyclical nature of the downstream energy industry.

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue and profitability have fluctuated significantly in recent years, driven by oil price volatility.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management reported a sharp decrease in earnings compared to the previous year, driven primarily by lower crack spreads.
* **Capital Structure:** MRAAY has a moderate amount of debt.  Management has been actively repurchasing shares, reflecting their belief that the stock is undervalued.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**  MRAAY's historical ROIC has been cyclical, exceeding its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in some years and falling below it in others.  

### Valuation

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, I arrive at an estimated fair value of approximately $45 billion for MRAAY.

{: .note }
>
> I am using the Enterprise DCF Model described in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% annually for the next 5 years, declining to 2% in perpetuity (pessimistic assumption given EV threat).
* **Operating Margin:**  5% (slightly below the historical average).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40% (consistent with a mature company).
* **WACC:** 8% (reflecting moderate risk).


**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) for the next 5 years using the above assumptions.**
2. **Estimate a terminal value using a perpetuity growth model.** Terminal Value = FCFF<sub>5</sub> * (1+g) / (WACC - g)
3. **Discount the projected FCFF and terminal value back to the present value at the WACC.**
4. **Add back the value of any nonoperating assets (e.g., excess cash, marketable securities).**  MRAAY had approximately $2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of Q2 2023.
5. **Subtract the market value of debt and other non-equity claims.** MRAAY had approximately $16 billion in debt at the end of Q2 2023. 
6. **Divide the resulting value of equity by the number of shares outstanding.** MRAAY had approximately 1.1 billion shares outstanding at the end of Q2 2023.

> As demonstrated in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, the DCF model is sensitive to assumptions about future growth and profitability.  Given the competitive challenges facing the downstream energy industry, I have used relatively conservative assumptions, leading to a lower valuation.

### Catalyst

MRAAY's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.

Potential catalysts for share price appreciation include:

* **Higher crack spreads:**  A rebound in refining margins could drive profitability.
* **Successful cost-cutting:** Management's efforts to reduce costs could improve margins.
* **Increased shareholder returns:** Higher dividends or share repurchases could enhance shareholder value.

However, these catalysts are uncertain, and the competitive and cyclical nature of MRAAY's business makes sustained outperformance difficult.

>
> As Michael Burry's analysis in the attached articles demonstrates, short-term catalysts can be fleeting.  A durable competitive advantage and undervaluation are essential for long-term investment success.  In MRAAY's case, the absence of a wide moat and the uncertainty of its future in the face of industry changes limit my catalyst rating.

### Concerns and Controversies

A key concern for MRAAY is the long-term threat posed by electric vehicles. While gasoline demand is likely to remain robust for the next several years, the long-term trajectory is downward, impacting the company's long-term growth potential. As mentioned earlier, management acknowledged the EV threat in the Q2 2023 earnings call, but their response was rather generic and lacked detail.  Another concern is the company's exposure to environmental regulations, which could add costs and pressure margins.  Additionally, the company's expansion into retail through the Speedway acquisition has not lived up to expectations.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management attributed this to a competitive market and lower than expected fuel margins, but a more thorough analysis is required to assess the long-term outlook for this business segment.  

### Conclusion

MRAAY is a solid but not exceptional company operating in a competitive and cyclical industry. While management has a record of shareholder returns, their capital allocation decisions have not always been consistent, and the company's future in the face of industry changes is uncertain. The current stock price appears to be reasonably close to fair value, but the absence of a wide moat and the uncertainty of future catalysts limit my enthusiasm for this stock.  A more detailed analysis of management's long-term strategy for navigating the EV transition and refining their retail strategy is needed before assigning a higher rating or valuation.
