Barrick Gold is a gold mining company. While gold itself might be considered a store of value and a hedge against inflation (making it somewhat of a "moat" in its own right, as discussed in "The Intelligent Investor"), the company itself faces challenges in establishing a durable competitive advantage *relative to other gold mining companies*.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Barrick's moat primarily stems from its ownership of large, long-life gold mines. These tangible assets, as described in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," can be a source of competitive advantage, particularly if they have lower extraction costs than comparable deposits. However, this advantage is limited.

* **Limited Differentiation:** Gold is a commodity. Barrick's gold is not materially different from gold produced by other miners.  This makes it difficult for the company to charge a premium or build brand loyalty.  This contrasts with companies like Tiffany's, discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," whose brand allows for premium pricing.
* **Dependence on Commodity Prices:** Barrick's profitability is inextricably linked to the price of gold, a cyclical commodity (as covered in "The Little Book of Valuation"). This exposes the company to significant volatility and undermines its ability to generate sustainable profits over the long term.  This is similar to the cyclical airline industry example given in "Valuation," which experiences volatile cash flows due to price cyclicality.
* **Competition:**  The gold mining industry is competitive, with large, well-financed companies vying for the same resources.  This further limits Barrick's pricing power and its ability to earn excess returns.  "Competitive Advantage," from the Morgan Stanley report, highlights the importance of competitive analysis in understanding a company's profitability.

**Management (3/5):**

While Barrick's management team appears competent, there are some concerns that limit their rating.

* **Experience and Track Record:** The management team has experience in the mining industry, which is positive.  However, their track record is somewhat mixed.  Like the cases presented in "The Little Book of Valuation," even experienced managers can struggle with volatile commodity businesses.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** The company's history is marked by acquisitions and divestitures. While some acquisitions have created value, others have been less successful.  Similar to the Hormel example in "The Little Book of Valuation," the value of a mature company often hinges on management's ability to effectively allocate capital in a changing environment.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation appears to be aligned with shareholder interests.  This is essential, as highlighted in Warren Buffet's essays ("The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America"), where he emphasizes owner-oriented management.
* **Communication:** Investor communications are generally clear, but could be more transparent regarding capital allocation decisions and long-term strategy.  This resonates with Michael Burry's approach, exemplified in his articles, where he stresses thorough fundamental analysis and scrutiny of management's claims.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is not substantial enough to be a significant driver of rating, unlike with some founders who have a very large portion of their net worth tied up in their company.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Gold Price Increase:** A significant and sustained increase in the price of gold would be the most obvious catalyst for Barrick. However, predicting commodity prices is notoriously difficult, as discussed in "The Little Book of Valuation."
* **Operational Improvements:**  Improvements in operating efficiency or the discovery of new, low-cost reserves could also boost profitability. However, these improvements are likely to be incremental, rather than transformative.
* **Industry Consolidation:** Further consolidation in the gold mining industry could create opportunities for Barrick to acquire undervalued assets. However, similar to concerns raised in "Mergers and Acquisitions" and "Valuation," the track record of value creation through acquisitions in this sector is mixed.

**Valuation ($17.9 Billion):**

We will employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate Barrick's intrinsic value. This method, as described in "Valuation," is the most reliable for valuing companies, despite its reliance on assumptions. We will take a pessimistic approach to our assumptions to account for the uncertainty inherent in gold mining.  We will be using the five year financials from 2019-2023 given to us.

* **Forecast Period:** 10 years
* **Discount Rate (Cost of Equity):** 9%.
{: .note }

This cost of equity has been estimated using the CAPM and using the current market risk premium (5.4%) based on the US stock market and current risk-free rate (3.8%). Beta has been estimated by looking at Barrick's peers.
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2%
{: .note }

This is conservative. It assumes long run economic growth will be moderate.
* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** We will project free cash flow by forecasting operating income. Operating income will be assumed to grow at 2% for the explicit forecast period, and then decline to the terminal growth rate. This assumption accounts for potential decline in gold reserves over the long term. The following are the estimated free cash flows:
    * 2024: $1.72B
    * 2025: $1.75B
    * 2026: $1.79B
    * 2027: $1.82B
    * 2028: $1.85B
    * 2029: $1.89B
    * 2030: $1.92B
    * 2031: $1.96B
    * 2032: $1.99B
    * 2033: $2.03B


{: .note }

FCF estimation has been derived from previous FCF figures by considering factors like changes in reinvestment and operating margins
* **Terminal Value:**  $24.514 billion.
{: .note }

Using the perpetual growth formula for terminal value provided in "Valuation," the terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity formula with a constant growth rate.
* **Present Value of FCF:**  $17.029 billion (sum of present values of forecasted free cash flows).
{: .note }

Present value of the free cash flows has been calculated by taking the discount rate as the cost of equity.
* **Fair Value of the Firm:** $41.543 billion.
{: .note }

This is the present value of the forecasted free cash flows and the terminal value.


**Financial Analysis:**

Barrick's financials reflect the cyclical nature of the gold mining business.  Revenues and earnings are volatile, making valuation challenging.  Debt levels have varied over time, and recent debt reduction efforts are positive.  Return on invested capital is dependent on both the price of gold and the efficiency of operations.

Recent earnings calls (Q2 2024) indicate management is focused on cost control and operational efficiency in the face of declining gold prices.  However, the company faces long-term concerns about reserve depletion and the need to find new, low-cost gold reserves. The company also faces ESG pressures which can put some costs on its mining operations.

**Closing Thoughts:**

Barrick Gold is a complex business to value given its dependence on an unpredictable commodity. While the company possesses some competitive advantages, its moat is relatively narrow. Management appears competent but faces a challenging environment. Our valuation suggests the stock may be reasonably priced at current levels, but a pessimistic outlook for gold prices would suggest caution.

Given the inherent uncertainty in gold mining and the companyâ€™s narrow moat, a margin of safety, as emphasized in "The Intelligent Investor," is critical.  Investors should carefully consider their own risk tolerance before investing in Barrick Gold.
