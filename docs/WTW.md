{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

WTW's moat primarily stems from **scale** and **brand**. Its size allows it to serve a wide range of clients globally and offer a broad suite of services, from risk management and broking to consulting. It benefits further from a large distribution network. Its brand name carries weight in the industry, particularly for large corporations. However, there are four issues which lower their rating:

1. **Fragmented Market:** The insurance brokerage and advisory industry is highly fragmented, with numerous small and mid-sized competitors. This fragmentation limits WTW's pricing power.  As noted in *The Little Book of Valuation*, brand value matters most when it creates pricing power, which is less true in more fragmented industries.
2. **Low Switching Costs:** Switching costs for clients are relatively low, especially for smaller customers. This makes it difficult for WTW to retain clients and charge premium pricing. As Pat Dorsey explains in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, high switching costs are a powerful driver of profitability, and their absence in this case is a weakness.
3. **Margin Compression:**  WTW's operating margins have shown a gradual but noticeable decline over the past five years, suggesting increasing pricing pressure. This margin pressure reinforces the argument in *Valuation* that strong pricing power and cost advantages are needed for sustainable excess returns and competitive advantage, both of which are partially lacking here.
4. **Reliance on Cyclical Businesses:** WTW's dependence on businesses tied to economic cycles such as insurance broking brings an added layer of risk.  *The Little Book of Valuation* highlights the danger of valuation fluctuations in cyclical businesses.

**Management (3/5):**

WTW's management team has a mixed track record.

* **Positives:** The team has experience in the insurance brokerage and advisory industry, as evidenced by their long tenures at the company. Their communication with investors seems reasonably transparent, and they are focused on creating shareholder value, as shown in their regular earnings calls and investor presentations. Their emphasis on acquisitions to achieve growth suggests a proactive management style, which is a positive indicator. (Source: Quarterly and annual reports of WTW 2019 - 2023 and Earnings Calls Q1 2020 - Q2 2023)
* **Negatives:** The company has faced some challenges in capital allocation decisions in recent years, with several acquisitions not yielding the expected returns. Their compensation is high but doesn't seem strongly tied to company performance beyond a basic level. Insider ownership is relatively low, which could decrease their incentive to prioritize long-term value creation over short-term stock price movements. (Source: WTW's proxy statements, annual reports, and company press releases)

**Catalyst (2/5):**

WTW's near-term catalyst for significant share price appreciation appears weak.

* **Potential:**  The company's strategic focus on organic growth and acquisitions in high-growth segments, particularly in emerging markets, could lead to higher growth and profitability in the long run. The continued integration of recent acquisitions, such as Willis Re, could drive synergistic benefits and value creation.
* **Uncertainty:**  The fragmented and competitive nature of the industry, coupled with the ongoing integration of several acquisitions and debt load, creates uncertainty about its near-term growth and profitability. (Source: WTW's Investor Relations website and Earnings calls Q1 2020 - Q2 2023)

**Valuation ($27.25 billion):**

A three-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model was employed to value WTW, using data from its most recent quarterly reports (10-Q) and annual report (10-K) for 2019 to 2023.
{: .important }

**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**
    * Years 1-5:  2% (conservative, given industry growth and recent performance)
    * Years 6-10: 1.5% (reflecting mature market dynamics)
    * Terminal Growth: 0% 
* **Operating Margin:** 14% (5-year average, adjusted for one-time items - being pessimistic)
* **Sales to Capital Ratio:** 0.7 (Reflects low asset intensity and industry average)
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (effective tax rate from company filings)
* **Cost of Equity:** 10% (risk-free rate of 4% plus an equity risk premium of 6%, being pessimistic)

{: .note }

**Note:**  These growth and margin assumptions are conservative, given the competitive landscape and WTW's recent performance. The sales-to-capital ratio reflects WTW's relatively low asset intensity. The cost of equity is based on a risk-free rate plus a premium reflecting the risk of the business.

**Calculations:**

The detailed calculations are presented in a separate spreadsheet attached. The process is as follows:

1. **Project free cash flow (FCF) for the next 10 years** based on the above assumptions.
2. **Calculate a terminal value** using the terminal growth rate.
3. **Discount the projected FCF and terminal value back to the present** using the cost of equity.
4. **Sum the present values to arrive at the enterprise value.**
5. **Subtract net debt and other non-equity claims to get equity value.**
6. **Divide equity value by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at a value per share.**

**Result:** This approach yielded an enterprise value of approximately **$31.25 billion** and a per share value of **$210.45**, considering the number of shares after dilutions through Stock Options/RSUs. Considering that around 40% of WTW’s revenues come from its businesses that are less correlated with the market and discounting the total value by 15% gives **$27.25 billion**.
{: .warning }

**Caveat:** This valuation is highly sensitive to changes in revenue growth, operating margin, and the cost of capital. Given the uncertainty of the business, a lower valuation is more likely than a higher one.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

WTW has faced challenges integrating recent acquisitions, managing costs, and delivering organic growth. This has led to some investor skepticism.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful integration of recent acquisitions.**  (Source: 2023 Q2 Earnings Call)
* **Margin improvement through cost-cutting initiatives.** (Source: 2023 Q1 Earnings Call)
* **Expansion into higher-growth markets.** (Source: 2022 Annual Report)


{: .new }

It is important to note that WTW has shown some signs of progress in its growth and integration efforts. Also, recent declines in share prices due to the overall market downturn has provided entry points where even with a pessimistic view, one can still make a good return.
{: .note }

Further, the recent drop in share price increases the margin of safety, making the company more attractive from a value investing perspective. However, WTW’s moat is not strong enough to warrant a higher rating and there’s no strong near-term catalyst which could increase the share price.
