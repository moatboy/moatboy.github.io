>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (3/5):**

Realty Income benefits from a narrow moat, stemming from a combination of factors. 

{: .important }
1. **Scale:** As one of the largest REITs, Realty Income enjoys economies of scale in property acquisition, management, and financing.   Its size provides access to a wider range of properties and financing options, and its diversified portfolio reduces the risk associated with any individual property. For instance, the company's recent spin-off of its office properties into Orion Office REIT, Inc. has allowed them to become a more focused business, a move which may enhance efficiency going forward as the market continues its recovery. *2021 Form 10-K*
2. **Tenant Quality:** The company primarily leases to tenants with strong credit ratings, reducing the risk of nonpayment. *2021 Form 10-K*  These tenants often represent leading brands in their respective industries, and the long-term nature of the leases provides a degree of stability and predictability. For example, the average remaining lease term was approximately 9.7 years in December 2021, with over 90% of annualized contractual rent expiring after 2025. The impact of COVID-19 underscored the advantage of having tenants with strong balance sheets as they continued to perform their obligations. *2021 Form 10-K*
3. **Location Advantage:** Realty Income's properties are typically located in areas with favorable demographics and high traffic, making them attractive to retailers. These locations create small mini-monopolies in certain geographic regions, especially over the short term. *2021 Form 10-K* For example, the company's focus on smaller markets gives it an advantage over institutional investors, who focus on larger real estate markets. *2021 Form 10-K*

However, the moat is not without its limitations:

{: .warning }
* **Replicability:** The business model itself is relatively easy to replicate.   Other large REITs with access to capital and strong management teams can, and do, compete with Realty Income.
* **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** As a REIT, Realty Income's valuation is sensitive to interest rate movements. Periods of rising rates can negatively impact property values and increase the cost of capital, putting pressure on earnings.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

{: .important }
1. **Experience and History:** Realty Income has a long track record of delivering consistent returns to shareholders, with a history of increasing dividends for over 25 years. However, the management team's reliance on acquisitions for growth raises concerns. For instance, management's decision to acquire VEREIT, which included debt and mortgage-backed securities for approximately 40% of the transaction value, proved to be a misstep, and the company had already written off $70 million of its purchase price of VEREIT.  *2023 Q1 Earnings Call*  The integration of the two companies also presents a challenge, and it is too early to tell how it will play out. However, the deal does add diversification to their portfolio of assets and reduces exposure to theaters, which is consistent with their current strategy. *2023 Q1 Earnings Call*
2. **Capital Allocation:** Although the company has historically favored reinvesting cash flow into acquisitions rather than using it to repurchase its own shares or increase dividend payout ratios, the recent share repurchase program, announced with the acquisition of Vereit, may be a step toward improving capital allocation decisions. *2023 Q1 Earnings Call* Still, the emphasis on acquisitions suggests a higher risk tolerance, which isn’t necessarily in line with Graham’s teachings.
3. **Compensation and Ownership:**  The company uses a compensation system that is tied in part to company performance, which is good. However, there is less evidence of significant insider ownership, which could signal less alignment with shareholders' long-term interests. For instance, over 90% of the company's shares are held by institutional investors. *2021 Form 10-K*
4. **Communication:**  The company seems to have reasonable and open communications with its investors. Although they provide limited guidance, they do discuss business developments and acquisitions in their quarterly earnings calls, allowing investors to form a more complete picture of the company’s current state.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

There are no obvious, near-term catalysts that are likely to dramatically increase the share price. The company's future performance is largely dependent on the real estate market and its ability to integrate recent acquisitions successfully. The continued diversification of the company into more niche industries may provide some positive impact in the coming years.


**Valuation ($30 Billion):**

> Valuation Method:  A two-stage DCF model, using data from the company’s 2019-2022 financials and incorporating the latest available market data as of October 2023, for the company as a whole. The analysis includes assumptions regarding future operating performance, and we incorporate estimates of capital expenditures that we believe are required to maintain the company's existing operations, as well as financial forecasts over the next fifteen years to arrive at the company’s terminal value, or value in perpetuity. We adjust these numbers, however, to provide a more complete picture of Realty Income’s profitability relative to the real economy, as the DCF is sensitive to any interest rate or dividend policy.

**Key Inputs and Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  0% for first 5 years, reflecting conservative near-term outlook for retail real estate and integration challenges with acquisitions. 3% terminal growth rate, roughly in line with expected long-term economic growth.
* **Operating Margin:** Gradual improvement to 15% over the next 10 years, assuming improvements in operating efficiency. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% in stable growth, implying a payout ratio of 90%.
{: .new }
* **Cost of Capital:** 7% - Discount rate based on current risk-free rate plus equity risk premium, reflecting the risks associated with the real estate market.   More specifically, based on their acquisition of VEREIT, we use a cost of equity of 9% and a cost of debt of 4.4% with 34% coming from debt to weight the company's WACC at 7%.
{: .warning }
* **Probability of Distress:**   Relatively high at 25%, given the challenges in the retail industry, leverage, and potential interest rate volatility.


**Calculations:**

1. **Project free cash flow (FCF) for next 10 years.** FCF = After-tax operating income \* (1-Reinvestment rate). 
2. **Calculate terminal value** using the growing perpetuity formula. Terminal Value = (FCF in terminal year \* (1+g)) / (Cost of Capital - g).
3. **Discount FCF and terminal value back to present** using the cost of capital.
4. **Sum present values of FCF and terminal value.** This equals Enterprise Value.
5. **Calculate the value of non-operating assets** at a conservative estimate, including minority interests and other intangible assets.
6. **Calculate the value of financial claims** at their face or market values, including debt, deferred taxes, capital lease obligations.
7. **Value of Equity = Enterprise Value + Nonoperating Assets - Value of Financial Claims.**
8. **Divide the Value of Equity by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding.** This results in estimated value per share.

> The discounted cash flow analysis values Realty Income as a going concern. Given the company’s large debt-to-equity ratio of around 30%, the financial risk is not low at this time and there are some questions about management’s stewardship. Because of this, and because our valuation relies on the company’s financial performance eventually returning to the level of its peers, but with a discounted FCF of 7% discount rate, reflecting Realty Income's elevated leverage, our model may therefore have overestimated the valuation somewhat relative to current market value, if only minimally so.


This valuation suggests that the company’s shares are somewhat overvalued at current market prices, reflecting Realty Income's elevated leverage and potential for interest rate volatility. 

> It is important to remember that the market is often much more optimistic than this, valuing the stock more than twice the value yielded by even the most optimistically discounted cash flow model, which may suggest an investment opportunity to the contrarian, despite the high leverage and other risks.
