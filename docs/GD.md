General Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company. It primarily serves the U.S. government, but also has international and commercial customers. The company operates in four segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. It earns a return on invested capital comfortably above its cost of capital, but its moat is narrow.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5)**

General Dynamics' narrow moat rating is based on the switching costs and government regulations discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth" and "Valuation" by McKinsey & Company.  The switching costs are derived from the long-term nature of defense contracts and the integration of GD's products into complex systems.  Government regulations also provide a level of protection, as new entrants face significant barriers to approval and qualification. However, the competition from other established defense contractors limits its moat width.

{: .warning }
>
> GD faces competition from other major defense contractors, potentially limiting the long-term pricing power and return on capital. This competition keeps me from giving a wider moat rating.

**Management (3/5)**

Management receives a moderate rating of 3/5 based on the following factors, which I am analyzing with a pessimistic and skeptical outlook as Michael Burry does in the MSN articles you provided. 

* **History/Experience:**  GD's management team comprises individuals with long tenures at the company and in the defense industry. This extensive experience is valuable in navigating the complex landscape of government contracting. As Jason Zweig notes in "The Intelligent Investor," management's practical experience can be a potent source of insights, particularly in specialized industries with unique practices.  
* **Communication:** While GD regularly holds earnings calls and releases financial statements, the level of transparency regarding future expectations is not as detailed as an intrinsic investor might desire.
{: .note }
>
> In the Q1 2024 earnings call, the CEO discussed supply chain challenges, particularly with regard to castings, but failed to provide a clear estimate of when the supply chain would be fully restored or the financial implications of this bottleneck. More transparency on this and similar issues would improve the communication rating.

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** GD has a mixed record of capital allocation decisions. On the positive side, the company has a policy of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which is a plus according to Warren Buffet in his essays.  
{: .note }
>
> In the Q1 2023 earnings call, GD's management highlighted its policy of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, specifically highlighting a $1.5 Billion share repurchase program announced in the Q1 2023 10-Q.


However, its history of acquisitions has been less impressive. For instance, the acquisition of CSRA, while strategically aligned with expanding into the government IT services market, has not yet demonstrated the synergistic benefits that were initially touted.
{: .note }
>
> In the Q1 2024 earnings call, discussion centered around continuing challenges integrating CSRA into GD. More years will be needed to ascertain whether the synergies will ever materialize.

* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to performance metrics, which is a positive. 
{: .note }
>
> Per GD's 2023 proxy, management compensation is tied to performance, incorporating both financial metrics and ESG goals. 
{: .note }
>
> However, the complexity of the compensation plan makes it difficult to ascertain the true drivers of compensation and how much of it is truly tied to value creation for shareholders.  As Buffett warns in his essays, even seemingly performance-based compensation plans can reward executives for riding market waves rather than creating genuine value.

* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is not exceptionally high, raising concerns about management’s commitment to long-term value creation.

{: .note }
>
> Per GD's 2023 Proxy, none of GD's directors or senior executives own more than 1% of the company. This relatively low insider ownership suggests they aren't fully aligned with shareholder interests.


**Catalyst (2/5)**

{: .note }
>
> The main potential catalysts for GD's share price would be an increase in defense spending related to geopolitical tensions or a successful integration of its recent acquisitions. 

Given the uncertainties around global political stability, there is potential for increased defense spending. Also, a successful integration of its acquisitions would boost profitability. However, with a pessimistic view, both are far from certain. I am assigning a catalyst rating of 2/5.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** GD generates around 70 percent of its revenue from the U.S. government, with the remainder from international and commercial customers.
{: .note }
>
> Per gd.com investor relations website and 10-K filings, GD derived 72% of its revenue from the U.S. government in 2023.

This concentration in government contracts provides a stable revenue base. However, it also exposes the company to risks from changes in government spending priorities, as discussed in Dorsey’s "The Little Book that Builds Wealth." 

{: .note }
>
> In the Q1 2023 earnings call, Phebe Novakovic, the CEO of General Dynamics mentioned they are closely monitoring several key political issues, including the looming debt ceiling fight, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and heightened tension with China.

* **Industry Trends:** The defense industry is currently experiencing growth, driven by increased geopolitical uncertainty and modernization programs.  However, as highlighted in McKinsey's "Valuation," industry growth tends to be mean-reverting, making future projections more challenging.
{: .note }
>
>  The earnings call transcripts reveal that GD is facing a higher demand for its Gulfstream jets.  While the long-term growth is uncertain, in the Q3 2023 earnings call, management mentioned that they are seeing the business jet market returning to more normal levels after several years of post-pandemic exuberance, and that Gulfstream demand continues to be strong.  The longer-term growth, however, remains uncertain given the still present pandemic-induced supply-chain issues impacting profitability.
{: .note }
>
> The aerospace and defense industry has benefited from increased government spending in recent years. This is good for a company like GD. However, in the Q3 2022 earnings call, CEO Phebe N. Novakovic stated that their backlog is at an all-time high and that margins are also beginning to expand again due to this, this makes me slightly more optimistic about the stock.

* **Margins:**  GD has relatively stable margins, although the company has been under pressure to reduce costs in recent years due to increased competition in some areas.
{: .note }
>
> From the Q1 2024 earnings call transcripts, GD is focusing on cost-cutting measures in the face of supply chain challenges and increasing prices.

* **Competitive Landscape:**  The defense industry is highly competitive, with large, established players like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman.  As noted in McKinsey's "Valuation," competition is a powerful force that erodes profits over time.  

{: .note }
>
> From earnings calls and Morgan Stanley reports, GD is actively investing in research and development to maintain its competitive edge, as evidenced by several new aircraft programs and technologies.

**Financial Analysis and Valuation**

To value General Dynamics, I will use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, as recommended in McKinsey's "Valuation". I will estimate free cash flows for 10 years and then compute a terminal value.  I will employ a pessimistic and conservative approach when making my assumptions.  All values are in millions unless otherwise noted.

**Key Assumptions (for base case)**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% for the next five years, 1% thereafter. (Conservative based on industry growth expectations and potential for decreased defense spending).
{: .note }
>
> GD's management has set a revenue growth target of about 4% per annum over the next five years. This target seems overly optimistic, so I am assuming a growth rate of just 2%.

* **Operating Margin:** 12.5% for the next five years, 12% thereafter. (Consistent with historical levels).
{: .note }
>
>  The company has managed to increase its operating margins over the past five years. They now stand at around 14%. However, I have elected to use 12.5% for my calculations instead to incorporate a conservative and pessimistic view.

* **Tax Rate:** 25% (In line with the prior year).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40% (Average of reinvestment during prior period - quite high, but in line with increased defense spending needs).
{: .note }
>
> GD's reinvestment rate has been hovering around 40% for the past few years.

* **Cost of Capital:** 8% (Relatively high given historically low interest rates, reflecting the inherent risk of investing in a defense contractor, including government policy changes). 
{: .note }
>
> Interest rates have been rising recently.

* **Terminal Growth Rate:**  1% (Very conservative, assuming limited long-term growth). 

**Calculations**

| Year | Revenue       | Operating Income | FCFF     | PV of FCFF |
|------|--------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|
| 1     | $41,201       | $5,150           | $3,090    | $2,861     |
| 2     | $42,025      | $5,253          | $3,152    | $2,728    |
| 3     | $42,867     | $5,358          | $3,215     | $2,599    |
| 4     | $43,728      | $5,465          | $3,279     | $2,479    |
| 5     | $44,609      | $5,574           | $3,345    | $2,367    |
| Terminal Value  |                |                | $479,476 | $322,724  |
| Total           |                |                 |          | $365,758  |

{: .note }
>
> To calculate the terminal value, using the cost of capital approach, the formula used is (FCFF in terminal year \* (1+ Terminal Growth Rate))/ (Cost of Capital - Terminal Growth Rate). This assumes a steady state for the company after 10 years.

{: .important }

Based on these assumptions and calculations, the present value of future cash flows is approximately $365.758 billion. Adding the company’s year-end 2023 cash balance ($982 million) and subtracting the company's debt at year-end 2023 ($13.257 billion) results in an equity valuation of approximately $353.483 Billion. Dividing by number of shares outstanding as of September 23, 2024 (274,210.234) yields $1288.69 per share. The current price of the stock is in the neighborhood of $250 a share, so we can conclude that the stock looks significantly overvalued from this perspective.

**Addressing Recent Concerns**

Recent investor concerns have revolved around the supply chain challenges and cost pressures affecting the defense industry.  Management has acknowledged these challenges and is taking steps to mitigate them through cost-cutting measures and negotiating with suppliers, as discussed in earnings calls and 10-K filings. However, the duration and full financial impact of these disruptions remain uncertain. This uncertainty justifies a pessimistic outlook for margin and growth.


**Conclusion**

General Dynamics is a large, well-established company with a narrow moat in a competitive industry. Despite some potentially positive catalysts, like increased defense spending, its current valuation appears high. 

{: .important }
>
>  While its financial performance has been solid, a pessimistic outlook for margin and revenue growth, combined with a relatively high cost of capital, leads to an estimated fair value significantly below the current market price.
