{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Accenture's moat stems primarily from **high switching costs** within its consulting and outsourcing businesses.  Once Accenture integrates deeply into a client's operations, it becomes costly and disruptive for the client to switch providers. This characteristic aligns with Pat Dorsey's emphasis on "sticky" customers in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, fostering pricing power and consistent profitability. The firm's global delivery capability, operating across 120 countries, also adds a layer to its moat by creating economies of scale and allowing Accenture to reach a wider customer base.

However, competition in the professional services industry is intense, and the firm's moat isn't impenetrable. The barriers to entry are relatively low, as evidenced by the proliferation of smaller consulting firms. While Accenture’s size gives it some advantage, it doesn’t offer the same level of protection seen in industries with network effects or unique assets.  Therefore, a rating of 3/5 seems appropriate.

**Management:**

Accenture's management receives a 3/5 rating.  While the firm has delivered consistent revenue and earnings growth, questions remain about their long-term focus and capital allocation decisions.

* **Positives:** Consistent revenue and earnings growth indicate management's competence in navigating the competitive landscape. Their stated strategy emphasizes high-growth initiatives, including cloud and digital transformation. The firm also actively manages its capital structure, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company's emphasis on long-term client relationships (average 10+ years for top 100 clients, as stated in their SEC filings) is also a positive sign.  As discussed in Aswath Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, returning cash flow to shareholders can be a positive indicator if firms lack high-return investment opportunities. Additionally, management appears to be transparent in communicating with investors, providing clear financials and frequently holding earnings calls and investor conferences.
* **Negatives:**  Accenture has an annualized voluntary attrition rate of approximately 13%, as disclosed in SEC filings and earnings calls, indicating a potential issue with employee retention. Further, concerns about management’s focus on “business optimization” costs and acquisitions to enhance revenue growth rather than core operations should be monitored. Like many consulting firms, Accenture uses share-based compensation, creating a dilution effect and potentially incentivizing a shorter-term focus on share price, similar to the example discussed in Warren Buffett’s letter to shareholders in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.

**Catalyst:**

Catalyst rating is 2/5. Continued growth in cloud and digital transformation could act as a catalyst, though the competitive landscape for these services continues to grow. As the industry’s reliance on these services increases, companies like Accenture stand to benefit, although competition is also increasing. As Michael Mauboussin points out in his paper *Measuring the Moat*, assessing market share and its stability is crucial for gauging a company’s long-term prospects. It remains to be seen whether Accenture can capture sufficient share to act as a significant catalyst.

**Valuation:**

A **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model was used to estimate Accenture's intrinsic value.  As emphasized in Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels' *Valuation*, DCF analysis, though not without its limitations, remains the most sound approach to valuation.  A pessimistic, cautious approach was taken in making the assumptions.

* **Revenue Growth:**  Based on Accenture's historical performance and management commentary in earnings calls (for example, from the second quarter 2022 call, they stated a revenue growth of 11% in local currency), a revenue growth rate of 5% annually for the next five years was assumed.  A terminal growth rate of 3% was used, reflecting long-term economic growth. 
* **Operating Margin:** Based on their historical average (around 16.75%) and the trend toward increased competition leading to margin compression, I expect the operating margin to decline to 15%.  
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Assuming sales to invested capital remains stable and using data from their 10K for invested capital, the reinvestment rate was estimated at 20%
* **Cost of Capital:** A cost of capital of 8% was used. This incorporates a risk-free rate of 4% (based on 10-year Treasury bond rates), a beta of 1.1 (calculated using historical data and sector betas for comparable firms), and a risk premium of 4% (reflecting heightened uncertainty).

* **Calculation of Terminal Value:**

Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 6) \* (1 – Reinvestment rate) / (Cost of capital – Expected growth rate)

* **DCF Valuation:**

| Year | FCF ($ millions) | Cost of Capital | Discount Computation | Discount Factor | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3,343 | 8% | 1/1.08 | 0.926 | $3,095 |
| 2 | $3,510 | 8% | 1/1.08^2 | 0.857 | $3,011 |
| 3 | $3,686 | 8% | 1/1.08^3 | 0.794 | $2,926 |
| 4 | $3,870 | 8% | 1/1.08^4 | 0.735 | $2,845 |
| 5 | $4,064 | 8% | 1/1.08^5 | 0.681 | $2,767 |
| Terminal Value |  | 8% |  | 0.681 | $126,420 |
| **Present Value of Firm** |  |  |  |  | **$137,964** |

Adjusting for cash, debt, and minority interests (using data from the most recent 10K) results in a value of equity of approximately **$192 billion**.  This implies a value of about $300 per share.
