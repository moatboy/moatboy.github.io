>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Mondelez benefits from several sources of competitive advantage, although the strength of its moat is moderate.

* **Intangible Assets (Brands):** Mondelez’s primary moat stems from its brand portfolio.  These brands enjoy high consumer awareness and loyalty, leading to pricing power in certain niches (e.g., Oreo in the packaged cookie market).  However, this advantage is not absolute.  Private-label competition and evolving consumer preferences constantly pressure margins, as noted in the company's Q3 2023 earnings call where Dirk Van de Put, Chairman and CEO, discussed price elasticity challenges.  Additionally, brand loyalty can be fickle, especially in price-sensitive segments.  While brands contribute to value, the snack food market, and many packaged goods categories, have low switching costs for consumers, limiting pricing power as highlighted in Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.  This means that while brands are valuable, they do not constitute a wide moat, as a well-funded competitor can build a brand over time through sufficient marketing.  The threat of new entrants and competition is discussed in Porter's *Competitive Advantage*.
* **Economies of Scale:**  As a massive global distributor, Mondelez benefits from economies of scale, particularly in distribution and procurement.  This advantage is significant, making it difficult for smaller firms to compete on cost, as mentioned in *Valuation* by McKinsey. However, as globalization increases, with cheaper production options readily available in developing markets, this cost advantage is not as pronounced as it used to be.  This has been addressed by management in various calls, where they acknowledged margin pressure from increased commodity costs and have mentioned efforts to manage costs and improve operating leverage across operating segments, including AMEA (Asia, Middle East, and Africa), Europe, Latin America, and North America.  Also as we saw in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, size itself is not a source of an economic moat.  Size is not relative, it is absolute.
* **Switching Costs (Limited):** Switching costs for consumers are low as it is easy for consumers to change brands from one month to the next, but as discussed in Dorsey's book, there are switching costs for retailers in the form of shelf space.  This gives Mondelez some pricing power, but this is not insurmountable.

**Management (3/5):**

While Mondelez’s management team appears capable, concerns about capital allocation and long-term focus temper the rating.

* **Capital Allocation:** The company's continued reliance on acquisitions for growth, despite mixed results, warrants some skepticism as Graham emphasizes in *The Intelligent Investor*, Acquisitions, although they give senior managers something to do, do not always create value.  The substantial premium paid for Cadbury in 2010 and the subsequent restructuring highlight this risk.  It was mentioned in the annual reports that Cadbury's acquisition contributed to increased debt and required asset write-offs, which negatively affected profitability in the short term. However, it increased Mondelez's exposure to high-growth emerging markets, as Luca Zaramella, CFO, mentioned in the Q3 2022 earnings call.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation, though not excessively out of line with industry peers, remains a key area to monitor, and this is mentioned in Buffet's essays on shareholder letters, where he emphasizes that compensation should be designed so that shareholders retain, and do not give away, most of the earning power of the business as it expands
* **Communication:**  The management team's communication about long-term strategy and competitive dynamics appears relatively clear.  They have explicitly addressed the challenge of fluctuating commodity prices and currency effects on performance. These were mentioned in the MD&A sections of the annual reports, especially in 2021 and 2022 where MDLZ discussed the commodity price inflation caused by COVID-19 pandemic.  However, their financial reporting seems overly focused on short-term earnings, potentially obscuring deeper structural challenges, as explained in Graham's *The Intelligent Investor* where he notes that Earnings Per Share is not a clear metric due to the various factors affecting it such as, growth, profit margin, leverage, share issuance, etc.  They could improve investor transparency by providing more segment and divisional performance data.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Moderate insider ownership provides some alignment with shareholder interests, but not to the degree observed in owner-operated businesses where managers have substantial portions of their net worth at stake as Buffet mentions in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.


**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Mondelez generates its revenues from four geographic segments: North America, Europe, Latin America, and AMEA.  Emerging markets, particularly in AMEA and Latin America, have been a key driver of growth, though growth rates have slowed recently.  They aim to further enhance their global leadership position by developing new chocolate and biscuit products as well as enhancing their existing products as discussed in the Q1 2023 earnings call.
* **Industry Trends:** The global snack food industry is large, growing, and fragmented.  Mondelez operates in a competitive environment, which pressures margins.  The industry is undergoing a period of consolidation, with larger players acquiring smaller brands.  Consolidation is further fueled by the changing buying habits of consumers as they buy snacks online through E-commerce platforms.  Healthier snacks are becoming increasingly popular, posing a challenge for Mondelez to innovate and adapt.
* **Margins:**  Mondelez operates in competitive markets and the prevalence of private-label snacks are gradually driving down price.  Operating margins are under pressure, although the company has implemented cost-cutting measures.  Pricing strategy and cost control will be critical for future profitability.  Profitability and margin management are discussed in-depth in the McKinsey piece on Moats (2024)
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The company faces competition from both smaller, local players and larger, multinational peers.  Key competitors include PepsiCo, Nestle, Unilever, and Hershey.  Differentiation through innovation and brand building is critical in this market.
* **What Makes Mondelez Different:**  Mondelez's global presence and established brand portfolio differentiate it from many competitors. The company is also investing in innovation and E-commerce to adapt to evolving consumer behavior. As mentioned in the Q3 2023 earnings call, they have new distribution channel initiatives in the E-commerce market.

**Financials:**

Mondelez’s financial statements reveal a large company with a history of stable operating profits and decent returns on invested capital.  However, a closer examination reveals some concerning trends and a few key areas to scrutinize:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Growth has been driven by both organic growth and acquisitions, with emerging markets a key contributor.  However, organic revenue growth has slowed recently as the company faces a drop in revenue growth rate.  Continued investment in its current distribution channels and efforts to enter new markets may be important to address challenges as discussed by the management in the Q4 2021 earnings call.  Further growth drivers for the company will be increasing consumer consumption of its snack products as they plan on increasing their marketing and promoting their snacks through advertisements and endorsements of its products.
* **Margins:**  As mentioned before, Operating profit margins are under pressure, primarily due to competition and commodity price fluctuations.  MDLZ mentioned in the Q1 2023 earnings call, that higher volumes in established markets and emerging markets had been offset by lower net pricing in both established markets and emerging markets due to the increase in investment in volume growth. The trend is slightly alarming, given that rising commodity costs are not easily controlled by management.
* **Returns on Capital:**  Returns on invested capital have historically been consistently between 15 percent and 20 percent.  This is a healthy rate of return, exceeding the cost of capital.  However, in the most recent year, returns have dipped below 20 percent, and this is largely driven by acquisitions that had not yet generated their full return potential.  As mentioned before, this is a concern about capital allocation and potentially unsustainable reliance on deals.
* **Cash Flow:**  Free cash flow has been healthy and rising.  However, the company's continued focus on acquisitions requires constant capital and as a result, free cash flow had been consistently negative for several years running. The company's capital needs will likely shift toward maintenance or repaying debt once the core business begins generating significant profits and growth begins slowing.  Share repurchases total approximately $2.9 billion in 2022 according to the annual report - a use of cash that should be examined closely by investors.
* **Debt:**  Debt levels are substantial, though manageable. The company used significantly higher leverage in recent years.  The company's leverage will likely drop back to its long-term historical average, and this trend is expected to persist.


**Valuation ($87.1 billion):**

Given the concerns about Mondelez’s moat, management quality, and recent financial performance, we arrive at a fair value estimate using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with moderately pessimistic assumptions.

* **Explicit Forecast Period (10 Years):** We assume revenue growth continues for five years, with revenue growth averaging about 2 percent annually. This should bring the company back to a modest 5 percent return on capital as earnings and cost pressures stabilize. We also assume 8.5 percent WACC and a terminal growth rate of 3 percent annually.
* **Terminal Value:** We will then value the firm at year 10 and assume that the risk free rate of return for a large company will equal the growth rate of the economy, which we conservatively estimate to be 3 percent and the return on capital of 20 percent.


**Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue | Margin | EBIT | Reinvestment | FCF  | Cost of Capital | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|$79,549|3.7%|$2,943|$736|$2,207|8.5%|$2,035|
|2|$81,142|5.5%|$4,463|$993|$3,470|8.5%|$2,922|
|3|$82,761|5.5%|$4,552|$1,118|$3,434|8.5%|$2,587|
|4|$84,408|5.5%|$4,642|$1,252|$3,390|8.5%|$2,307|
|5|$86,083|5.5%|$4,735|$1,396|$3,339|8.5%|$2,071|
|Terminal|$49,316| | | | |7.5%|$44,538|
|**Sum of PVs**|$56,459|


Then we assume current capital of $23,719 million, cash and marketable securities of $1,415 million, minority interests of $2,256 million, and equity options of $812 million, and total debt of $19,512. The resulting enterprise value is $81,245 million, and dividing the equity value ($61,733) by the number of shares outstanding, we get a value per share of $45.42. The actual market price per share was $57.42 in July 2023. Thus, the company is modestly overvalued.

**Catalysts (2/5):**

* **Improved Cost Control:**  If management executes successfully on its cost-cutting initiatives, margins could improve.  This would likely be viewed positively by the market.
* **Emerging Markets Growth:**  While growth has slowed recently, emerging markets still offer significant long-term potential.  If Mondelez can reignite growth in these markets, it would boost revenue and earnings.
* **Successful Innovation:**  The snack food industry is constantly evolving.  If Mondelez can develop innovative, "on-trend" products that resonate with consumers, it could drive revenue growth. For example, MDLZ has added several new biscuit products to appeal to the biscuit consumers as noted by the management in the Q2 2023 earnings call.

**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Activist Investor Involvement:** Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management has acquired a sizeable stake and pushed for changes including increased cost cuts and share repurchases. This brings both opportunity and risk. While Peltz's involvement could lead to improved shareholder returns in the short term, it could also pressure the company to prioritize short-term gains over long-term value creation. As of now, Peltz is on the board of the company. 
* **Commodity Price Volatility:**  Fluctuating commodity prices are an ongoing risk for Mondelez.  Management has spoken extensively about hedging strategies, but the effectiveness of these hedges in mitigating earnings volatility remains to be seen.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  The war in Ukraine and overall global political instability could further disrupt Mondelez’s supply chain.

**Conclusion:**

Mondelez is a well-established company with a recognizable brand portfolio and a global distribution network. Its moat is narrow. However, questions about management's focus on acquisitive growth and the challenges posed by commodity price volatility temper the overall investment thesis.  Based on a pessimistic DCF model, the shares appear to be overvalued at current levels. The margin of safety is small, and consequently, it is a hold rather than a buy.
