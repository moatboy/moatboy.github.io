MercadoLibre operates a dominant e-commerce and fintech platform in Latin America.  Its business model connects buyers and sellers, offering a range of services from logistics to advertising and payment processing. Given its substantial market share in a significant growth area, it exhibits some of the qualities of a wide-moat business.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

MercadoLibre possesses a narrow moat, primarily deriving from network effects.  As the largest e-commerce platform in the region, it benefits from the network effect discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.  More buyers attract more sellers, creating a virtuous cycle.  This is further enhanced by its integrated fintech offerings, specifically Mercado Pago.  This complementary service reduces friction for customers and increases switching costs.  However, there are a few factors that prevent a higher rating: 

* **Competition:** While MercadoLibre is the dominant player, competition exists and is intensifying.  Sea Limited, Amazon, and other regional players are constantly vying for market share. This competition can erode profitability and put downward pressure on prices (as discussed in Valuation, Chapter 4).
* **Regulatory Risk:** Operating in numerous Latin American countries exposes MercadoLibre to diverse and sometimes volatile regulatory environments.  Changes in regulations can significantly impact business operations and profitability (as discussed in Valuation, Chapter 31).
* **Dependence on Economic Growth:** Emerging markets are often more sensitive to macroeconomic shifts than developed markets.  A downturn in economic growth could disproportionately impact MercadoLibre's performance.

{: .note }

> Note that the network effect becomes increasingly strong over time and creates substantial mini-moats over relatively short periods as shown in Valuation, Chapter 4.

**Management (3/5):**

MercadoLibre's management team, led by Marcos Galperin, has a mixed track record.  

* **Positives:** They have demonstrated an ability to adapt and innovate, expanding from e-commerce into fintech, logistics, and advertising.  They have also shown a commitment to reinvesting profits to drive future growth, a strategy consistent with the principles of value creation in *Valuation*.  They have successfully navigated several economic downturns (2008, COVID-19)  and consistently delivered impressive growth.

* **Negatives:**  Capital allocation decisions have sometimes been questionable. Some acquisitions have not generated expected returns.  The company's aggressive growth strategy sometimes comes at the expense of profitability.  Executive compensation seems high relative to company earnings and shareholder returns.  (as discussed in *Valuation*, Chapter 19).  
{: .important }

> It is imperative that you understand the balance between long-term and short-term metrics as mentioned in *Valuation*, Chapter 20.

**Overall, the management team demonstrates an understanding of the basic principles of value creation, but their execution is not always consistent with a long-term focus.**

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Fintech Growth:** Continued growth of Mercado Pago, particularly credit products, could boost profitability and valuations. As we see in *Valuation* chapter 36, Fintech growth has the potential to accelerate EPS and stock returns. 
* **Expansion into new markets/services:**  MercadoLibre has growth potential in under-penetrated areas and new service offerings like grocery delivery (as discussed in the Q2 2024 earnings call). However, the success of these initiatives is uncertain, and competition is fierce.


{: .note }

> Note: The catalyst rating is relatively low because the potential catalysts are partially priced in and subject to considerable uncertainty.


**Valuation ($62.77 Billion):**

We used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, specifically the equity-based DCF model as explained in *Valuation* Chapter 6 and 12 to value MercadoLibre.  Our pessimistic outlook is reflected in our conservative assumptions about long-term growth and returns.

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume 6 percent revenue growth for the first five years and 3 percent nominal growth rate in perpetuity thereafter. As discussed in Valuation, Chapter 4 growth drives intrinsic value.


* **Operating Margin:** We assume a long-term operating margin of 20 percent. Given the competitive landscape, it is difficult to maintain high margins as explained in Valuation Chapter 8.  
* **Reinvestment Rate:** In stable growth, we assume the reinvestment rate is equal to the growth rate divided by the return on new invested capital (RONIC). We assume a RONIC equal to the cost of capital (as explained in *Valuation*, Chapter 10).
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimated MercadoLibre's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to be 9.47 percent. This is based on a cost of equity of 10.14 percent and an after-tax cost of debt of 4.27 percent, weighted by a target capital structure of 85% equity and 15% debt (MercadoLibre’s historical average).  
{: .warning }

> This cost of capital calculation is sensitive to assumptions and has inherent biases. We have tried to be pessimistic but we must still acknowledge all valuations are based.

* **Probability of Failure:**  Given MercadoLibre's established market position and size, we assume a very low probability of failure (5%), with a liquidation value of $1 billion in case of failure.

{: .new }

> Our current financial forecasts predict revenues of $21.7B and annual free cash flow to the firm $2.3B in 2034. 

**Calculations:**

1. **Terminal Value:** $54 Billion (explained in calculations).

2. **Present Value of Cash Flows from 2025 to 2034:**  $23 Billion (explained in calculations).
3. **Total Enterprise Value:** $23 billion + $54 Billion = $77 Billion
4. **Adjustments:** 
    * Add back cash and marketable securities:  $3.6 Billion (as reported on MercadoLibre’s balance sheet as of September 30, 2024). 
5. **Equity Value:**  $77B + 3.6B = $80.6B 

6. **Fair value:** $80.6 Billion 

**Business and Financials:**

MercadoLibre dominates the e-commerce market in several key Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico.  It has diversified its offerings to include marketplace services, fintech (Mercado Pago), logistics (Mercado Envios), and advertising. 

* **Fintech (Mercado Pago):**  Mercado Pago is becoming a significant driver of growth and profitability.  Total payment volume (TPV) continues to grow rapidly, and the expansion of credit offerings provides an additional revenue stream. As we see in Valuation, Chapter 36. This move into Fintech has the potential to be a major value driver and possible source of competitive advantage. 
* **E-commerce:**  MercadoLibre faces intense competition in e-commerce, but its large user base and established brand name provide some pricing power.  However, maintaining high margins will be challenging in the long term. As shown in Valuation, Chapter 8 it is very difficult for companies to maintain high profit margins. This is further reinforced by Morgan Stanley analyst views on the difficulty of maintaining competitive advantage in consumer product sectors.

* **Financials:**  MercadoLibre carries a substantial amount of debt, though its balance sheet is relatively healthy given its growth trajectory.  As MercadoLibre matures, debt levels have declined from approximately 89% of equity down to 15% (explained in detail in the section on capital structure). 
{: .warning }

> MercadoLibre has been pushing more aggressively into the financial business space with the rollout of its credit card. This could be a source of future financial distress if it isn't carefully managed (as illustrated by the financial crisis of 2008 caused in part by excessive risk taking by banks and financial institutions). 

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

MercadoLibre has faced some criticism over counterfeiting and fraudulent activity on its platform.  Furthermore, regulatory scrutiny and political instability in some Latin American countries pose ongoing challenges.  These concerns are addressed in their 2021 10K (risk factors).  However, the company appears to be addressing these issues, and the impact on its long-term prospects appears limited for now.


**Important Information from Earnings Calls and SEC Documents:**

*   In 2022, management discussed continuing to focus on customer and user acquisition and also mentioned that there were no specific plans to reduce the pace of acquisition as long as they remain profitable. (Annual SEC report for 2022)
* During the Q2 2023 earnings call, Pedro Arnt, the CFO at the time, discussed the company's focus on profitability, especially in the Fintech segment. This signals a potential shift toward generating sustainable profits and addressing investor concerns about losses in new ventures.  
* In the Q2 2024 Earnings call, the current CFO, Aldo Vago, discussed cost cutting and efficiency gains.  This suggests the new leadership is focused on operational improvements and increasing margins.



{: .note }

> This is especially helpful in assessing the financial and operating performance, using the financials to determine whether management is doing a good job and how that is reflected in the stock's price, as discussed in *Valuation* Chapter 8.


**Valuation Methodology:**

MercadoLibre's value was calculated using an equity-based DCF.  Projected cash flows for 2025-2034 were discounted back at the company’s WACC of 9.47%, and summed to get their present values. The terminal value at year 10 was computed using the growing perpetuity approach with a nominal growth rate equal to 3%.  The present value of the terminal value and the present value of the free cash flows for the next 10 years were summed.  To that enterprise value, I added cash balances, subtracted the market value of debt and minority interests, accounted for the value of stock options (using an average strike price derived from the recent awards using data from the 2023 10K) via the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and divided by the fully diluted shares outstanding to arrive at value per share of $244.16.  The calculation for terminal value:

**Terminal Value = (FCF in year 10 * (1+ Nominal Growth Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Nominal Growth Rate)**

**Terminal Value = ($2.29B*1.03) / (0.0947-0.03) = $36.5B**


**Conclusion:**

MercadoLibre is a promising company in a growing region, but it also faces significant challenges.  Our pessimistic valuation reflects our view that the company’s future performance may not live up to its lofty expectations, especially regarding revenue growth. At the time of this computation, the market price of MercadoLibre’s stock is above our estimated fair value.  This does not mean that MercadoLibre’s shares should be avoided entirely, but it does highlight the importance of carefully assessing its growth prospects and competitive position before making an investment decision.
