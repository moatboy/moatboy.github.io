Pessimistic value: $1.4 B

Trust Financial Corporation operates primarily as a bank holding company. Their business activities, though diverse within the financial sector, are not sufficiently differentiated to constitute a wide moat. The company primarily generates net interest income from loans and investments, but also earns fee income from wealth management.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

TFC operates in a highly competitive industry with low switching costs for most customers. While the bank has a regional presence, it doesn't possess a meaningful competitive advantage such as intangible assets (strong brands), switching costs, network effects, or cost advantages that would prevent competitors from taking market share.  

> I am giving a rating of 2 because the banking sector, by its nature, has commoditized products and services with low customer switching costs. There are no structural cost advantages or any other moats listed in Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* that would give this company a strong, durable competitive advantage.  

**Management (3/5):**

TFC's management has a mixed track record. While they have made efforts to diversify revenue streams, organic growth has been lackluster, and returns on equity have not consistently exceeded the cost of capital.  Capital allocation decisions, including acquisitions and share repurchases, seem reasonable, but have not yet translated into substantial value creation. Compensation levels for top management seem generally aligned with bank holding company peers, but there is no evidence of exceptional shareholder returns to justify higher ratings. Insider ownership is relatively low, suggesting less skin in the game than desired, which according to Graham in *The Intelligent Investor* is critically important to making successful investment decisions.  Communication with investors could be more transparent, with limited detail provided on business unit performance and drivers of growth in the earnings releases and conference calls.

> The rating of 3 is based on a balanced assessment. There's no evidence of egregious mismanagement, but also no clear indication of exceptional capital allocation skill or shareholder value creation.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

While TFC has made efforts to expand its geographic presence and product offerings, there is no clear catalyst to drive a significant increase in profits and share price. The industry remains very competitive, and TFC does not seem better positioned to navigate industry trends and competitive threats than its peers.

> The catalyst rating of 2 reflects the absence of a clear and imminent catalyst on the horizon.

**Valuation ($1.4 Billion):**

TFC's valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which according to Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels in *Valuation*, is the most reliable valuation method, and incorporates pessimistic assumptions about future financial performance.

* **Base Case:** TFC is a mature company with limited growth potential. We project organic revenue growth of 2 percent and an operating margin of 14 percent over the next five years. The reinvestment rate is estimated at 30 percent. The terminal value assumes a perpetual growth rate of 1 percent in conjunction with a return on equity of 5 percent. The cost of equity is 8 percent, based on an unlevered beta of 0.7 and a market risk premium of 4.5 percent. The effective tax rate is 25 percent.  The probability of distress is estimated at 10%. 

* **Downside Case:** A more pessimistic scenario assumes a prolonged economic recession, leading to a 1 percent decline in revenue over the next 5 years. Margins are assumed to decrease to 12 percent due to pricing pressures and declining asset quality. We decrease the perpetual growth rate to 0%.

>**Calculations:** 
>1. **Project free cash flow to equity (FCFE) for each of the next five years and the terminal year** (See tables from Valuation Little Book below). Negative free cash flows indicate that the company needs to invest money in its operations or raise additional capital.
>2. **Discount the projected FCFE** at the cost of equity of 8% to estimate equity value for a going concern and at 2% (risk free rate) to estimate equity value at distress. 
>3. **Calculate the probability weighted equity value** by multiplying the equity valuation under each scenario by the likelihood of that scenario occurring. Base case is assigned 70% probability and Downside Case 30%.
>4. **Add excess cash** on the balance sheet. TFC has very limited excess cash.


>**Assumptions Justification:** The estimated future revenues, margins, reinvestments, and cost of capital are based on historical data, industry trends, and peer company data. The perpetual growth rate is set at a conservative level.  The catalyst rating is based on a pessimistic outlook for near-term upside potential.
>**Result:** The probability-weighted present value of FCFE yields a value of **$1.4 billion**.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

The 2020-2023 years were troubled for TFC and its financials. The major concern during that time was the extremely challenging macro and market climate in financial services industry and rising competition, which affected both asset quality and deposit levels and thus led to losses. The management made efforts to support the impacted business lines through various initiatives including deferrals and loan modifications. The management thinks that these adjustments will provide a pathway to eventual value creation for shareholders. Management has been focused on cutting back on R&D and advertising, improving operational efficiency, strengthening client relationships, and developing business lines. They expect these actions to eventually improve the company's competitive position.

**Financial Highlights:**

Trust Financial made the acquisition of Heritage FSB (Heritage Savings Bank) in September 2019.  The transaction valued the bank at a price-to-tangible book value of 2.06, a very rich multiple of around 175% of the underlying business. Heritage was a small bank with some troubles.  According to Trust’s December 31, 2019, 10-K,  for the nine-months leading up to the merger, the bank had $31.8 million in revenues, $17.1 million in operating income before provisions for loan losses, and a book value of $50.1 million.  In addition, the bank had $231.9 million in loans and another $103.8 million in liquid assets, primarily held in the form of securities that are marked-to-market. However, the price implied by the bank’s financials, were less than what the management thought about it.

* **Revenues:**  In recent years, Trust has successfully expanded its retail bank segment. For Q3 2024, retail banking provided 44% of net interest income, compared with only 31% coming from corporate and industrial loans. Their reliance on lower-returning securities has shrunk considerably as well.
* **Profitability:** Trust Financial has a loan heavy portfolio (63% of total assets). Because the majority of Trust’s loans are long-term in nature, Trust is subject to more volatility in income as long-term rates and short-term rates fluctuate and converge, decreasing profitability.
* **Capital Allocation:** Trust Financial seems to have successfully navigated the financial turmoil of recent years.  The company sold non-core assets to plug the hole on its balance sheet and shore up its regulatory capital position.  They also initiated a stock buyback program and suspended the dividend, preserving cash for a rainy day. The balance sheet is now at a healthy Tier 1 Capital Ratio.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Recovery of interest margins:**  As interest rates stabilize, Trust could see a substantial improvement in its net interest income. (2025 Onward).
* **Successful integration of acquisitions:** The successful integration of Heritage Savings Bank could lead to cost savings and revenue synergies.
* **Expansion into new markets:** The expansion of the company into other markets would open up the market for its products and could generate future business.

**Valuation methodology**

The valuation approach for TFC is similar to the one employed by Michael Burry for Amazon in 2000 and is based on an enterprise DCF. The free cash flow framework for TFC is outlined below. The key elements include Free Cash Flow to Firm, Reinvestment, Growth, Return on Equity (ROE), and Cost of Capital.

**Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** is the after-tax cash flow available to equity holders, debt holders and any other investors in the company.
**Reinvestment** is any portion of earnings not paid out as dividends but retained by the company for investment purposes. Reinvestment rate equals reinvestment/earnings.
**Growth** is simply a business world application of Newton’s first Law of Mechanics: If a body is at rest or moving at a uniform speed in a straight line, it will remain at rest or keep moving in a straight line at that speed unless it is acted upon by a force. This means that the revenues of a growing company will continue to grow.
{: .warning }
**Return on Equity (ROE)** is the return that shareholders see on their equity in the business. The ROE is not something that is set in the marketplace. It is determined within the company itself. A company can easily increase shareholder value by simply increasing the ROE.

**Cost of Capital** includes cost of equity, cost of debt, tax benefits and debt-to-equity ratio.

**Key assumptions for 2025-2029 and perpetuity:**

* Revenue growth: 2% (decreases gradually over the years)
* Target operating margin: 14%
* Reinvestment rate: 30%
* Cost of equity: 8%
* Cost of debt: 5%
* Tax rate: 25%
* Perpetual growth rate: 1%
* Return on equity in perpetuity: 5%


These assumptions are based on several factors, including historical performance, industry benchmarks, management's comments from prior years' earnings calls, and a slightly pessimistic outlook for the future.  

> Management plans to return TFC to a business as usual trajectory for profitability (Q3 2024 Earnings Call). TFC expects a return to more normalized interest rates which would imply a return to increased profitability. TFC expects this to allow more opportunities for diversification, both in revenue and also in geography (Q3 2024 Earnings Call). The recent financial performance across several years have not been strong, and while management expects to improve company profitability in future, my assumptions are slightly pessimistic.

**Valuation Steps:**

1. **Estimate Cash Flows:** Based on the assumptions above, the following Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) projections (in millions) and Present Value (PV) estimates were derived for the years 2025-2029 and beyond. Please note that these are all estimates, and any financial metric estimates may be very very off from the true estimate of the firm's actual financial performance. As Damodaran points out in the preface to *The Little Book of Valuation*, all valuations are biased.

    | Year | FCFF  | PV   |
    |------|-------|------|
    | 2025 | $707  | $571  |
    | 2026 | $756  | $594 |
    | 2027 | $778  | $602 |
    | 2028 | $872 | $651 |
    | 2029 | $988  | $708  |
    | Terminal Value | $44,538 | $25,330 |


2. **Calculate Present Value of Operating Assets:** The sum of the present values of FCFF for 2025-2029 and beyond, discounted at 8% cost of capital, is $33,456 million.

3. **Calculate Enterprise Value:** Add to the present value of operating assets the value of nonoperating assets. Assume the value of TFC's nonoperating assets is $500 million. The sum of operating assets and nonoperating assets gives an enterprise value of $33,956 million.

4. **Calculate Value of Equity:** Subtract from enterprise value the market value of financial obligations/claims other than equity.  Assume TFC's liabilities are $22,074 million. Subtracting this amount from enterprise value gives the equity value of $11,882 million.

5. **Adjust for Distress:** Multiply the equity value by one minus probability of distress of 10%. The distress adjusted equity value is $10,693 million.

6. **Calculate Per Share Value:** Divide equity value by the number of shares outstanding. TFC has approximately 500 million shares outstanding. Dividing $10,693 million by 500 million shares gives a per share value of approximately $21.4.


>**Note:** Given the uncertainties inherent in valuation, it's important to view this estimate as a range rather than a precise number.  Also,
