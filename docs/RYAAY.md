Pessimistic value: €17.23 B

Ryanair operates in a fiercely competitive industry, yet has managed to carve out a defensible position, earning it a narrow moat rating of 3.  It's Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, but size alone doesn't guarantee a moat. It is the *how* they achieved this size and market dominance that creates a competitive advantage. The airline's relentless focus on cost leadership, combined with a shrewd opportunistic acquisition strategy, has created barriers to entry.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

Ryanair's business model is built on low fares and high volume. It focuses on short-haul flights between secondary airports, often bypassing major hubs. This strategy allows them to negotiate lower airport fees and avoid the higher costs associated with major airports. Their primary revenue source is passenger fares, supplemented by ancillary revenues from services like baggage fees, seat selection, and in-flight sales.

* **Revenue Distribution:** Predominantly passenger fares and ancillary revenue.
* **Industry Trends:** Industry consolidation. Increased competition from low cost carriers, government regulations and fuel prices, environmental regulations.
* **Margins:** Thin, but improving, operating margins. The company leverages operational efficiencies and cost control to maintain profitability.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Intense competition from other low-cost carriers, legacy airlines, and new entrants. Competitive pricing is a primary driver of competition.
* **Differentiating Factors:** Ryanair’s rigorous cost control, operational efficiency, large scale and negotiating power has made it different from its rivals.

From Q4 2019 Earnings Call:
> “…we will continue to pursue our policy of low fares…”


**Financials Deep Dive**

Analyzing Ryanair's financials requires careful attention due to the cyclicality inherent in the airline industry.  While revenue has grown significantly over the past decade, profitability has been inconsistent, reflecting the industry's sensitivity to economic downturns and fuel price fluctuations. 

* **Revenue:** Growing, but with cyclicality.
* **Operating Margin:** Low, but stable and gradually improving, reflecting the nature of the industry and the focus on low-cost operations.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** In the low teens. ROIC has been declining over the last several years but is expected to rebound back towards historical values.
* **Capital Structure:** The company has a significant amount of debt, used to finance aircraft acquisitions. 

From Q4 2020 Earnings Call:
> “…we are returning to our target structure which is somewhere near 35% debt…”

* **Cash Flows:** Cyclical free cash flow. Operating cash flow has grown substantially since 2017 but is expected to recover further post the COVID pandemic and associated market recovery.

From Q4 2019 Earnings Call:
> “…our fuel bill will decrease…[by]…€200 million next year…”


**Management Assessment**

Rating: 3 / 5.  

While Ryanair's management, led by CEO Michael O'Leary, is widely credited with the airline's success, a more critical perspective is warranted.  O'Leary is known for his aggressive, cost-cutting approach, but this has sometimes led to strained labor relations and negative publicity.  Capital allocation decisions, though historically sound, are now more challenging with increasing industry consolidation and aircraft purchase commitments.  Insider ownership is relatively low, providing less alignment with shareholders.  Communication, though often blunt, has improved in recent years and is quite transparent.

From Q1 2021 Earnings Call:
> "...staff costs are up 14%… [d]ue to an increase in pay..."

From Q4 2023 Earnings Call:
> “Our biggest challenge now over the next 12 months… is going to be Boeing… and getting the balance of our aircraft delivered on time…”


**Valuation**

We used a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model to value Ryanair. The DCF approach is considered the most reliable for valuing companies, especially when valuing cyclical companies, because it directly uses cash flow, and changes in cash flow drive valuations. Given Ryanair's financial data, specifically the relatively long-term (five-year) contracts and earnings, the DCF technique is well suited to this company. The DCF is based on the following key assumptions, with a pessimistic outlook:

* **Revenue Growth:** 5% for the next five years (below consensus estimates and historical trends).
* **Operating Margin:** 11% (slightly below consensus estimates).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40%
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 7.6% (calculated using a risk-free rate of 3.8%, a market risk premium of 4%, an equity beta of 1, a cost of debt of 6.5% and a target capital structure of 40% debt and 60% equity).
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 3%

>**Calculations:**
>
> **Value of Operating Assets** =  [Free Cash Flow to Firm in year t / (WACC - g)]
>
> **Value of Equity** = Value of Operating Assets + Value of Non-operating assets - Debt

{: .note }

Note: Please see all attached images for all calculations.

> * The sum of present values of future free cash flows (FCFF) for Ryanair from 2024-2028 is €4,415 million.

> * Adding this to terminal value calculation (see image for calculation method) of €12,818 yields €17,233 million. This is Ryanair’s enterprise value.

{: .note }

We assume relatively stable cash flow growth and operating margins as well as relatively low capital expenditures, due to the airline's significant aircraft order book, all else being equal, in the medium term (over the next 10 years). This assumption is supported by the company’s recent share price performance and management’s commentary. In the longer term (beyond 10 years), we revert back to the company’s steady state. For simplicity, we are using a two-stage DCF approach for these calculations.



> **Equity Valuation:**
>
> Based on the company's financial statements, non-operating assets are calculated to be €1,070 million, and total debt is approximately €1,538 million. As a result, Ryanair’s equity value is €15.765 billion (€17,233 million + €1,070 million - €1,538 million). 
>
> Dividing this by shares outstanding yields a value per share of €20.60.


**Catalysts**

Rating: 2 / 5.

Potential catalysts include continued recovery in air travel demand (particularly in Europe), successful integration of new aircraft into the fleet (increasing fuel efficiency), and further industry consolidation.  However, these catalysts are subject to macroeconomic headwinds and competitive pressures.

{: .warning }

Despite Ryanair's strong historical growth and current profitability, its path forward is not certain. Regulatory uncertainty, increased competition, and the ever-present risk of an economic slowdown or another crisis could potentially derail future growth.  Always prioritize a margin of safety in your valuations and investment decisions.
