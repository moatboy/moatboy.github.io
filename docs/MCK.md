{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

McKesson’s moat primarily stems from scale advantages in pharmaceutical distribution. As one of the largest distributors, it benefits from:

* **Large distribution network:**  This creates a cost advantage, as the fixed costs of running trucks, warehouses, and so on are spread over a large volume of products. It also allows for faster and potentially more efficient distribution to their massive number of clients (pharmacies, hospitals, etc.) making them “sticky”.  
* **Customer switching costs:** As detailed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, switching costs exist. Existing customers are reluctant to switch distributors due to the integrated software, logistical complexity, and potential disruptions to their operations. This was further confirmed by the company's statement in their Q3 2023 earnings call about McKesson's rollout of a new enterprise resource planning system,  which they noted will create tighter integration and increase customer stickiness.

However, these advantages are not insurmountable:

* **Competition:** Other large players like Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen exist, lessening McKesson's pricing power.
* **Technological disruption:** Though unlikely in the near term, the possibility of a more streamlined, technologically-driven distribution system entering the market, bypassing traditional distributors, cannot be entirely dismissed, as noted in *The Little Book of Valuation* which discusses disruptive innovation. 

> Although there are no such competitors at present, new, smaller players may enter the market, potentially with a disruptive business model based on new technology, which could threaten McKesson's position.


**Management (3/5):**

A mixed picture emerges when evaluating management:

* **Capital Allocation:**  Large acquisitions (e.g., of Celesio in 2013 and Rexall Health in 2016) have driven revenue growth, but their success in creating shareholder value has been mixed, mirroring the difficulties with acquisitions discussed in *Valuation*.  As noted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, a key consideration when assessing acquisitions is profitability improvement, and organic growth is preferable to acquisition-driven growth. McKesson's growth has largely been acquisition-driven, which is riskier for investors.  This further strengthens the pessimistic view.

> Acquisitions and divestitures have become increasingly significant to our business over the last few years.

{: .note }

As noted in the Q3 2023 call, McKesson completed a divestiture of its Austrian business in July and is expecting to close the sale of its French retail business by the end of FY24.

* **Communication:** McKesson regularly provides detailed segment information, and management's commentary during earnings calls is fairly transparent. However, they haven't always been adept at forecasting long-term revenue growth. As Michael Mauboussin discusses in *Expectations Investing*, the more uncertain the future, the wider the gap between projected and actual numbers. 
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation is largely tied to company performance, and there is reasonable insider ownership, aligning their interests with shareholders. However, as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*,  incentive plans sometimes prioritize short-term goals over long-term value creation. Moreover, executive compensation is high, potentially creating a substantial moat on the company's overall profits. 


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Generic drug pricing pressure:** This remains an ongoing concern, potentially impacting margins.  As noted in the Q1 2024 earnings call,  McKesson expects pricing trends to remain challenging, but the recent slowdown in the pace of price decreases is encouraging. 
* **Specialty drug growth:** This could be a growth driver, but the specialty market is becoming more competitive. In the Q1 2024 earnings call, Brian Tyler, CEO, noted that the company saw significant growth in specialty pharmaceuticals in recent years, particularly in oncology and biosimilars.
* **Cost-cutting initiatives:** The company has implemented several cost-cutting measures, which could improve margins. These initiatives should improve profitability and ROIC if management's execution turns out to be as good as they claim. The Q1 2024 call mentioned realizing operating expense savings from cost optimization programs.

> We expect to improve operating profit through the introduction of additional high-margin products and through cost reductions.


**Valuation ($41.2 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model, following the principles described in *Valuation*, was used to estimate McKesson's intrinsic value.  A pessimistic outlook was adopted, given the industry challenges and competitive landscape. This resulted in a lower fair value than the current price. 


**DCF Model (with probability-weighted scenarios):**

1. **Forecast Period (10 years):** Forecasted revenue growth rate at 3% annually for first five years (reflecting the current economic growth climate and pricing pressure for generic drugs), declining to 2% in stable growth period.  Operating margin assumed stable at 1.5% (low relative to historical averages but reflecting current pressure).  Tax rate assumed to remain at 25%.  Reinvestment rate derived using revenue growth, operating margin, and return on capital (ROIC). ROIC was forecasted at 7% (in line with peers and historical averages, but lower than recent years).
{: .important }
2. **Terminal Value:** Used the key value driver formula using stable growth period ROIC. Inferred long-term nominal growth at 2%, return on new invested capital (RONIC) at 7%, and a cost of capital of 9%.

     > **Terminal Value = NOPLAT<sub>t</sub>(1-g/RONIC) / (Cost of Capital-g)**

3. **Cost of Capital:** Estimated using weighted average cost of capital (WACC).   Cost of equity derived using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) with a risk-free rate of 4% (10-year US treasury bond rate), a beta of 0.9 (in line with peers), and a market risk premium of 5%. A pretax cost of debt of 5% assumed (in line with current market yields on investment-grade corporate bonds) with a 25% tax rate.  Target capital structure of 30% debt and 70% equity.
4. **Probability-weighted scenarios:**  Created a base case (described above), an upside case (higher revenue growth and margin), and a downside case (lower revenue growth and margin).  Assigned probabilities of 40%, 30%, and 30%, respectively.  The probabilities reflect potential tailwinds and headwinds for the business and the industry and were selected based on McKesson's performance, its industry dynamics and its ability to adapt to upcoming industry challenges and changes.

> We're very early in the rollout [of our new ERP]. The strategic reason for this rollout is enormous, and we will see the very big financial and practical impacts of this rollout over time.


The resulting valuation, using a DCF approach with probability-weighted scenarios, after combining our various growth, margin, and probability assumptions, was $41.2 billion.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

McKesson has faced scrutiny for its role in the opioid crisis, and continues to be involved in related litigation. The company has settled several lawsuits, and  is accruing funds to cover future settlements.  These potential payouts are factored into the valuation model by increasing litigation expense and adding a discount rate premium. As the case is based on several years of opioid crisis cases from all across the country, it has a serious impact and must be modeled.

> We are adding to our reserves as the trials are going on, as you would expect, and as they come to a close, our reserves will reflect that.

{: .note }

The Q1 2024 call discussed $1.3 Billion of opioid-related settlement expenses already recorded in the quarter. 


**Additional Notes:**

* This valuation is based on currently available information and could change substantially as future performance unfolds.  As both *The Intelligent Investor* and *Valuation* emphasize, the value of a company is always changing.
* The company’s extensive distribution network and complex operations make a detailed segment-by-segment valuation impractical for this assessment.  As suggested in *Valuation*, a simplified approach is often sufficient for larger companies with a long history. 

> It is impossible to provide a complete and correct answer unless one has unlimited access to data.

This would make a comprehensive valuation difficult even if one had access.

* There is considerable uncertainty about the long-term impact of generic drug pricing pressure and biosimilar competition on McKesson's margins. This is reflected in the assumed future growth rates and operating margin.
