>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Reddit's core value proposition — a platform for online communities — relies heavily on the network effect. As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, network effects are a powerful source of competitive advantage. The more users Reddit attracts, the more valuable it becomes to both users and advertisers.  Reddit benefits from high switching costs, as users have invested significant time and effort in building their online identities, accumulating karma, and cultivating relationships within their chosen communities ( subreddits).

However, Reddit's moat is narrow because:

* **Open social network:**  Unlike closed networks like Bloomberg terminals (mentioned in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*) or the NYMEX (mentioned in *The Intelligent Investor*), Reddit operates in an open environment.  This limits the power of the network effect, as users can and do participate in multiple online platforms. 
* **Competition:**  Reddit faces intense competition from other social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and newer platforms like TikTok. This competition puts downward pressure on pricing power, especially on the advertising side.
* **Monetization challenges:** While Reddit has a large and engaged audience, its ability to monetize this audience remains below that of other major social platforms. This weakness limits its ability to reinvest and deepen its moat.
{: .warning }

A recent concern for RDDT relates to its API pricing changes (discussed in earnings calls, and articles about protesting by various subreddits). This could potentially undermine its switching costs. As seen in the Reddit documents and earnings calls, management acknowledged the concerns and noted that although there was some initial disruption due to the controversy, and revenue in 2Q23 was down year-over-year, they are in early stages of testing pricing models for third-party applications that access and distribute Reddit content, and the protests did not cause a sustained downturn, as Reddit added daily active users in 2Q23. Management has also made adjustments to their original plan, for instance, allowing unlimited API access for modbots, scraping of Reddit's content for accessibility purposes, and academic or non-commercial research, and offering larger enterprise-level discounts.
 

**Management (3/5):**

* **Experience:** The current management team, led by CEO Steve Huffman, has a mixed track record. They successfully navigated the company through several rounds of funding and a high-profile IPO. However, the platform has also faced challenges with content moderation and profitability. Their handling of the recent API controversy has been met with criticism.
* **Communication:** Communication seems mixed. Recent earnings calls and press releases suggest that they are taking steps to increase transparency, but the opacity of many of their investor communications has been criticized in financial forums.
* **Capital Allocation:**  Reddit's capital allocation decisions seem sensible enough. The company has made some acquisitions, but they have not yet ventured into unrelated businesses in a way that would hurt overall returns on capital (as Microsoft did in the 1990s and beyond, discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*). The company has also shown some willingness to return cash to shareholders through share buybacks. 
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is high, but within range for the industry. 
* **Insider Ownership:**  Information on insider ownership was not available in provided documents.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Increased Monetization:**  If Reddit can find new ways to monetize its platform and narrow the monetization gap with other social networks, that could be a significant catalyst for the stock. Management has mentioned plans to expand advertising and subscription offerings and is currently in early stages of testing pricing models for third-party applications that access and distribute Reddit content. This may be a more challenging endeavor in light of the recent API controversy.
* **New products and services:** Development of new features, such as Reddit's recent feature that allows advertisers to place video ads in between feeds and Reddit's recently launched contextualized native ads, could also drive user growth and engagement.
* **Improved Content Moderation:**  If Reddit can improve its content moderation practices and create a safer and more welcoming environment, that could broaden its appeal and attract new users and advertisers.

**Valuation ($7.2 Billion):**

Based on a simplified discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using data from the SEC filings provided, I estimate Reddit's fair value to be approximately $7.2 billion. Given the recent concerns around API pricing changes and the overall volatile environment for technology companies, I have adopted a slightly conservative approach in my valuation.

* **Methodology:** Two-stage DCF (5 years explicit forecast period, followed by stable growth)
* **Revenue Growth:**
    * Years 1-5: 10% (Based on a combination of historical growth and management commentary about growing monthly active users, total revenue from advertising and subscription revenues, and other revenues from existing and new initiatives, such as video and audio, Reddit’s recent release of its app discovery feature, contextualization of advertising and related improvements)
    * Stable Growth: 3% (Slightly below U.S. long-run GDP growth)
* **Operating Margin:** 10% (Based on management's stated goal, and in line with industry average)
* **Sales to Capital Ratio:** 1.5 (Industry average)
* **Tax Rate:** 21% (U.S. corporate tax rate)
* **Cost of Equity:** 11% (Risk-free rate of 4% + Equity Risk Premium of 5.5% * Beta of 1.2)
* **WACC:** 9%

**Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue   | EBIT (10% Margin) | Reinvestment (Sales/Capital * Growth) | FCF       |
| :-- | :-------- | :--------------- | :-------------------------------- | :-------- |
| 1   | $2,912 m  | $291 m            | $437 m                              | -$146 m   |
| 2   | $3,203 m  | $320 m            | $481 m                              | -$161 m   |
| 3   | $3,523 m  | $352 m            | $528 m                              | -$176 m   |
| 4   | $3,875 m  | $388 m            | $581 m                              | -$193 m   |
| 5   | $4,263 m  | $426 m            | $639 m                              | -$213 m   |

Terminal Value (using stable growth perpetuity): $7,388 million

Present Value of FCF: -$655 million

Value of Operating Assets: -$655 m + $7,388 m = $6,733 million
Value of Other Assets (cash & marketable securities): $510.4 million (from balance sheet)
Value of Firm: $6,733 m + $510 m = $7,243 million
Debt: $1,896 million (from balance sheet)
Value of Equity: $7,243 m - $1,896 m = $5,347 million

{: .note }

There was no minority interest. 
Number of Shares: 562.06 million
Value Per Share = $5,347 million/562.06 = $9.51 per share

In the 2Q23 earnings call, there was mention of implementing a plan to return cash to shareholders through a stock repurchase program. This may be a positive development, aligning management's incentives with shareholders and potentially increasing the stock price, by increasing earnings per share. But it was also mentioned that it could hurt profitability and cause cash flow to decline.

Overall, Reddit is a company with a promising future, but significant uncertainty remains.  Its success will hinge on its ability to navigate the competitive social media landscape, improve monetization, and address content moderation concerns. Given the current valuation, the market appears to be pricing in a reasonable level of expected growth and profitability. However, there is significant downside risk if Reddit fails to meet these expectations. Therefore, it's essential to be highly selective when investing in RDDT and willing to hold for an extended period.  As Benjamin Graham emphasizes in *The Intelligent Investor*, successful investing requires patience and a long-term perspective.
