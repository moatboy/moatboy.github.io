{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

NWG possesses a *narrow moat*, stemming primarily from the high switching costs faced by retail banking customers.  As discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, customers are often reluctant to switch banks due to the hassle involved in transferring accounts, setting up new direct deposits, and the potential for disruptions. This stickiness creates a mild barrier to entry for new competitors.  

However, NWG's moat is weakened by several factors:

1. **Competition:** The banking industry is highly competitive, with many large players offering similar products and services.  This limits pricing power and makes it difficult for any single bank to maintain high returns on capital for extended periods, as noted in *Valuation*.
2. **Regulation:**  The banking sector is heavily regulated, limiting the potential for outsized returns, a point made in *The Intelligent Investor*. While regulation can create a stable environment, it also caps the upside potential.
3. **Shifting Landscape:** The rise of fintech companies and digital banking platforms is challenging traditional banking business models and eroding customer switching costs, as discussed in the Morgan Stanley report on moats.


**Management Assessment (3/5):**

NWG's management receives a *moderate* rating.  While the bank has demonstrated some improved financial performance in recent years, there are concerns that warrant a cautious outlook:

* **History/Experience:** The bank's near collapse during the 2008 financial crisis raises serious questions about the long-term judgment of management, a point mirrored in *The Intelligent Investor*. While current management is different, the legacy of that experience warrants a degree of skepticism.
* **Capital Allocation:**  While NWG has recently been returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, its history of acquisitions has been mixed, mirroring the findings in *Valuation* about the difficulty of creating value through acquisitions. The bank’s disastrous acquisition of ABN Amro in 2007 is a case in point.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to earnings per share, potentially encouraging short-term decision-making at the expense of long-term value creation, as discussed in *Valuation*.  Greater emphasis on return on invested capital and growth could improve the incentives.
* **Communication:** Management’s communication during earnings calls is generally adequate but could be more transparent about its long-term strategy and how it plans to navigate the changing competitive landscape. Michael Burry’s investment journal highlights the importance of candid and detailed communication. 
* **Insider Ownership:** While some level of insider ownership exists, it is not high enough to fully align management’s interests with those of outside shareholders, a concern echoed in *The Intelligent Investor*.


**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

NWG has a *moderate* catalyst rating. Potential catalysts include:

1. **Further Cost Cutting:**  As mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call, NWG continues to pursue cost efficiencies. Successful implementation could improve margins and potentially boost the share price. However, as noted in *Valuation*, cost cutting often fails to deliver its promised benefits.
2. **Improving UK Economy:** As noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call, macroeconomic headwinds are impacting the UK economy and, consequently, NWG's performance. An improvement in the UK economy could increase loan demand and profitability. However, there is significant uncertainty about the economic outlook, as highlighted in Michael Burry’s journal.

**Valuation (£27.2 billion):**

We employed a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value NWG, using the equity cash flow method. The model uses a 10-year forecast horizon followed by a terminal value:

1. **Revenue Growth:** We forecast revenue growth of 2% annually, in line with expected long-term growth in the UK economy, as mentioned in NatWest's Q2 2023 earnings call.  
2. **Margins:** We assume a net income margin of 10% gradually decreasing to 8%, reflecting increased competition.
3. **Cost of Equity:**  We used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with a risk-free rate of 3.5%, a market risk premium of 5.5%, and a beta of 1.2, derived from NatWest's price volatility relative to the FTSE 100, as shown in their annual report. This leads to a cost of equity of 10%.
4. **Cost of Debt:** We used the yield to maturity on NWG's 10-year corporate bond at 4.5%.
5. **Capital Structure:** We used a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity, in line with similar firms, as mentioned in NatWest’s annual filings. This leads to a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 9.25%.
6. **Terminal Value:** We used the key value driver formula (Valuation, page 216) with a terminal growth rate of 1% and a return on new invested capital (RONIC) of 6%, leading to a terminal value of £22.8B.

**Calculations:**

| Year | Net Income (£ millions) | Reinvestment (£ millions) | Free Cash Flow to Equity (£ millions) | PV Factor | Present Value (£ millions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2,338 | 337 | 1,901 | 0.91 | 1,729 |
| 2 | 2,392 | 346 | 2,046 | 0.83 | 1,698 |
| 3 | 2,447 | 355 | 2,092 | 0.76 | 1,588 |
| 4 | 2,503 | 365 | 2,138 | 0.69 | 1,475 |
| 5 | 2,560 | 375 | 2,185 | 0.63 | 1,375 |
| Terminal |  |  |  | 0.63 | 14,365 |
| Total |  |  |  |  | 22,230 |


Adding net debt of £3.8 billion to the present value of equity cash flows results in a total enterprise value of £26B.  Adjusting for other assets and nonoperating cash of £1.2 billion results in a total fair value of £27.2 billion or approximately £3.0 per share (based on 9,074 million shares outstanding). Given market volatility, this estimate represents only a midpoint and does not entirely reflect current conditions.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

NWG has faced several challenges in recent years, including conduct-related issues, increased regulatory scrutiny, and macroeconomic headwinds. As discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call, the de-banking of Nigel Farage has created controversy and negative publicity for NWG.  Management acknowledged the reputational damage but maintained that the bank acted appropriately. This issue highlights the potential for reputational risk to impact the company's share price.



{: .note }

**Additional Considerations:**

The fair value estimate could change significantly if the UK economy weakens further or if regulatory scrutiny intensifies. Investors should remain vigilant about the potential for further disruptions in the banking sector, particularly concerning conduct risk.  A buyback was mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call, but it was not detailed enough to be incorporated into the valuation at this time.
