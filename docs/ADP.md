{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

ADP possesses a narrow moat based on high switching costs and the network effect.

* **Switching Costs:**  Changing HCM providers is a complex and time-consuming process for businesses, particularly large enterprises.  Disruptions to payroll and HR functions can be costly and create significant headaches.  This inertia provides ADP with pricing power and protects it from competition.

>In the Q2 2023 Earnings Call, CEO Maria Black mentioned, “Retention remains a key metric of focus for us in growing the business. And we’re really pleased with the results we’re seeing on the retention front. We ended the quarter with a retention rate of 98.1%, in line with where we were in the second quarter of last year.”

* **Network Effect:** ADP has created an integrated ecosystem of services which reinforces customer lock-in. Their vast network of clients provides valuable data which they leverage for benchmarking and developing new features. The larger the network, the more attractive the service becomes to potential customers and partners, which in turn makes it tougher for new entrants to compete.

> In the Q2 2023 earnings call, the management mentioned a new product called “DataCloud” that would benefit from network effect.

However, the moat is not impregnable.  Smaller, more nimble competitors are nipping at ADP’s heels, particularly in the small- and medium-sized business segment.  Furthermore, the increasing standardization of HCM processes could lower switching costs over time.

**Management (3/5):**

ADP’s management team exhibits a mixed record.

* **Positives:**
    * **Focus on growth:** The company has consistently focused on growing its revenues and profits through organic initiatives, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships. 
    * **Solid reinvestment:** While ADP’s reinvestment rate is high, the company has shown it can reinvest these funds in organic growth initiatives with high returns, which in turn benefits the firm and its shareholders.
* **Negatives:**
    * **Acquisition-driven growth:** ADP depends heavily on acquisitions for increasing growth. This, although can create value, comes at a risk - both in terms of overpaying for acquisitions and integration challenges.
    * **High compensation:** Management pay packages are generous, particularly for a mature company.  Although they do contain performance metrics, they raise concerns about alignment with shareholder interests, especially given the stock-based component. 
    * **Overpaying for acquisitions:** The company has made acquisitions where the strategic intent was not clear and has subsequently divested some of these acquired businesses, which suggests that management may overestimate synergies and be too eager to overpay.

> In the Q2 2021 Earnings Call, CEO Carlos Rodriguez admitted to having problems integrating a recently acquired business.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Expanding into new markets:** ADP is expanding into new geographic markets, primarily in emerging economies, which offer substantial growth potential. This, however, is a long-term play, and as discussed in the book, growth often fails to translate into intrinsic value.
* **New product development:** ADP is investing in developing new products and features to strengthen its competitive advantage.  The success of these new initiatives, however, is uncertain and could fail.


**Business Overview:**

ADP operates in a growing market but faces increasing competition. Its HCM business model is mature, with stable margins, but its reliance on acquisitions for growth makes sustainable profitability a challenge.

**Financials:**

* **Revenues:**  ADP’s revenue growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth, acquisitions, and currency effects.
* **Margins:** Operating margins remain stable but could decline in the coming years as a result of intensified competition and the company's focus on faster growth, which requires sacrificing profitability. 
* **ROIC:** ADP earns a healthy return on invested capital, which has been largely stable in recent years. However, the company’s reliance on acquisitons for a significant part of its growth means that future growth might come at a lower ROIC, which will not necessarily benefit the firm and its shareholders in the long run.
* **Capital Structure:** ADP maintains a healthy financial position with low debt.

**Valuation ($81.2 billion):**

We used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value ADP, employing a **10-year explicit forecast**.  This method aligns with a more conservative approach and minimizes our reliance on the terminal value which, as warned by the book Valuation by McKinsey, can mask many sins.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Average of 2% nominal growth in line with the long-term average economic growth of the US economy.
* **Operating Margin:** Stable at 22%, reflecting the mature nature of the business.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  10% (gradually decreasing over time)
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5.5%, a beta of 0.92, a cost of debt of 4%, and a target capital structure of 16% debt)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 3% - in line with long-term inflation in the US economy, the rate at which the nominal value of everything eventually grows.
* **Probability of default:** 0.6% over next 10 years based on B rated bond.


**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projections:** Project FCF for the next 10 years using the above assumptions. (See Table 5.4 and detailed computations for FCF in previous pages).

2. **Terminal Value:** Compute the terminal value using the stable growth perpetuity formula:
    ```
    Terminal Value = (FCF in year 11) / (Cost of Capital - Terminal Growth Rate)
                    = $4.125 billion / (0.09 - 0.03) = $68.75 billion
    ```
3. **Present Value of FCF:** Discount the projected FCFs and terminal value back to the present at the cost of capital, and add the non-operating assets, and adjust for probability of default.

> I have calculated the value using the given assumptions and the discounted cash flow approach, to obtain the value of $81.2B.

* **Note:** There are limitations associated with using a DCF valuation and that there are multiple factors that are inherently unpredictable, such as changes in consumer demand, and the arrival of a hostile bidder (as was the case for Zomato)
