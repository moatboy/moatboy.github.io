>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** ADP's revenues primarily come from fees paid by employers to process payroll and provide other HCM solutions.  They also generate revenues from commissions on insurance products and fees from retirement plan administration.
* **Revenue Distribution:** ADP operates globally, with a significant presence in North America, Europe, and increasingly in Asia and other emerging markets.  Their revenues are diversified across various client sizes, although the bulk comes from small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).  Within HCM, the breakdown is between Employer Services (primarily large and medium-sized businesses) and PEO Services (primarily SMBs).  
* **Industry Trends:** The HCM market is evolving rapidly.  Cloud-based solutions are gaining share, increasing competition, and putting pressure on pricing.  Data security is increasingly critical, and businesses are seeking integrated solutions to manage a growing array of human resource-related regulations. Consolidation within the PEO segment has intensified the need for scale to succeed.
* **Margins:** ADP’s operating margins are relatively stable, generally ranging between 18 and 22 percent of revenue.


**Moat Analysis**

ADP possesses a **narrow moat**, earning a rating of **3 out of 5**. The key sources of its moat are:

* **Switching Costs:** Changing payroll providers is a significant hassle for businesses.  Integrating a new provider’s systems with existing HR and accounting software can be complex and time-consuming.  The potential disruption to payroll accuracy and compliance, coupled with employee frustration, creates significant switching costs.
* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** ADP benefits from brand recognition and trust, particularly among SMBs.  Its long operating history and reputation for reliability contribute to its brand strength.  However, this advantage is eroding as new, lower-cost competitors enter the market, particularly in cloud-based HCM.
* **Network Effects (niche):**  Although niche network effects exist in the PEO business where there are shared-service offerings, the network effect for ADP is not sufficient to create a strong moat by itself. The shared services offered here typically rely on size more than network effects.

{: .warning }
*It's important to note that ADP's moat is not unassailable.* The rise of cloud-based HCM providers and the increasing focus on price create challenges for ADP. The network effects are not as important as scale. Therefore, a lower rating has been assigned for a network effect. The company's continued success will depend on its ability to innovate and adapt to the changing market landscape.  Specifically, the continued success of ADP will be driven by the degree to which the company can maintain its position among small and medium-sized businesses and maintain margins in the face of increasing competition.

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model has been used to value ADP.  A five-year explicit forecast period has been considered, followed by a continuing value.  Given the recent economic turbulence and uncertainties associated with it, it seems appropriate to err on the side of pessimism in the valuation assumptions.

**Key Valuation Assumptions and Calculations**

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% for the next five years, and then assume growth will gradually decline to 0% for stable growth.
* **Margins:**  Margins gradually increase from 2023 actuals towards 2022 EBIT margins, before declining in the continuing value period to 16%.
* **Reinvestment:**  Reinvestment rate will be scaled from prior years, assuming that it will eventually decline towards its long term average of 10%.
* **Tax Rate:** Effective tax rate for the next five years of 20% and then it gradually increases towards 24%.
* **Cost of Capital:**  The cost of equity has been calculated using CAPM with the risk free rate of 4%, a beta of 0.92 (levered), and an ERP of 5.5%, giving a cost of equity of 9%. Then, adding the default spread of 1.27% and the US marginal tax rate of 25%, we get an after tax cost of debt of 4.27% for ADP. The market-based capital structure is estimated to be 20% debt and 80% equity. This gives a WACC of 7.56%.
* **Terminal Value:** Assuming a growth rate of 0% and a cost of capital of 7.5%, then subtracting 10% reinvestment rate gives a value of $49.3 billion for operations.

**Calculations**
* **Present Value of Cash Flows (2024-2028):** $15.32B
* **Present Value of Continuing Value:** $44.53B
* **Value of Operating Assets:** $59.85B
* **+ Cash:** $1.31B
* **- Debt:** -$20.07B
* **Value of Equity:** $41.19B
* **Value/Share:** $82.38


**Valuation Conclusion**

* **Fair Value:** $87.6 billion. This valuation of ADP is based on the preceding explicit forecasts. It is sensitive to several assumptions, some more than others, as sensitivity analysis in the spreadsheet model will show. It is important to note that although valuations are based on the fundamental laws of economics, including supply and demand, economies of scale, and cost of capital, uncertainty about the future remains ever-present. The value of any asset ultimately is driven by the economic climate of the moment of valuation and is a function of our expectations about the firm's future business performance. For instance, any negative surprise relating to ADP’s revenue growth, margins, capital expenditures, or acquisitions will cause the value to be lower than the value being presented and any positive surprise relating to these same assumptions will cause the value to be higher.

* **Current Market Price (as of 7/21/2024):** ~$97.8 billion.  ADP appears to be slightly **overvalued** relative to its intrinsic value. Given the uncertainty and risks associated with its financial outlook and ongoing lawsuits, a significant margin of safety is required before investing.

This valuation is based on the information available as of July 21, 2024.  Future performance may differ significantly from these projections, and the stock market may not react to company developments as anticipated.  Investors should conduct their own due diligence and analysis before making investment decisions.
