Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. It operates in two main segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.  While Halliburton benefits from some scale advantages, its business is largely commoditized, making it challenging to establish a sustainable competitive advantage, or a "moat," in a sector dominated by giants like Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Halliburton's moat is narrow.  While size can offer some advantages (cost efficiencies, bargaining power with suppliers), these are partially offset by the intense competition in the oil services sector.  Furthermore, technological innovation, while present, tends to diffuse rapidly across the industry, limiting its potential to create sustainable competitive advantage. Switching costs for customers are also low.  As Damodaran points out in *The Little Book of Valuation*, cost advantages are most relevant in industries where price is a large part of the customer's purchase decision. However, in oil services, technical expertise and execution often outweigh price considerations, eroding any cost-based moat. HAL does not benefit much from switching costs either as evidenced by the frequent shifts in market share with competitors driven primarily by short-term pricing dynamics.

**Management (3/5):**

{: .note }

Management quality is a key consideration.  While current leadership appears competent (CEO Jeff Miller has overseen revenue growth and margin expansion, as discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call), long-term capital allocation decisions raise concerns. Past acquisitions have not always delivered on promised synergies.  Additionally, executive compensation seems tilted toward stock options and stock awards (as detailed in the 2023 Proxy Statement), potentially incentivizing short-term decision-making at the expense of long-term value creation.  Insider ownership is reasonably high, which is a positive, but overall, there is not enough evidence to warrant a rating above average.


**Business:**

* **Revenues:** Halliburton derives most of its revenues (about 85% in Q2 2023) from North America. Its international business is spread across multiple regions, including Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and the Middle East/Asia.  This geographical concentration creates dependence on the North American energy market, exposing it to regional economic fluctuations.
* **Industry Trends:**  The oil services industry is cyclical, with demand driven by oil and gas prices and exploration and production activity. The industry is also consolidating, with mergers and acquisitions becoming increasingly common.  This trend is likely to continue as companies seek to gain scale advantages and improve their competitiveness.  Halliburton's 2014 Baker Hughes merger attempt, subsequently abandoned due to antitrust concerns (as discussed in the Q4 2014 earnings call), illustrates the challenges of realizing value through acquisitions in this environment.  The industry also remains subject to technological disruption and regulatory pressures related to environmental issues.
* **Margins:**  Operating margins in the oil services industry tend to be relatively thin.  For Halliburton, adjusted operating margins have shown improvement, reaching 21.5% in the trailing twelve months (TTM).  However, given the industry's cyclicality and the risk of cost inflation, the sustainability of these margins remains a concern. Furthermore, management mentioned in Q2 2023 that they are actively managing price increases in response to inflationary pressures, and there are limits to how much of these they can pass along to customers.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The oilfield services market is highly competitive, with Schlumberger and Baker Hughes being the other two major global players.  Competition is primarily based on price, technology, and execution, with limited differentiation among offerings.  In a commoditized business like oil services, as mentioned in Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, the competitive advantages of most players are short-lived.


**Financials:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Halliburton's revenue has increased significantly over the past two years, exceeding $20 billion in the TTM.  However, growth is heavily reliant on North American market conditions and is not consistently reflected in earnings or cash flow growth, potentially suggesting an unsustainable growth trajectory.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**   As outlined in Koller et al.'s *Valuation*, ROIC is a crucial metric. Halliburton's ROIC in 2023, adjusted for acquisitions, stands at approximately 16%. This is a good ROIC. However, this is only for a single year and in prior years, it has been lower. Given the cyclicality of the energy sector and its dependence on capital investments, the sustainability of its ROIC is a risk.
* **Capital Structure:** Halliburton's debt ratio has increased as a result of the BHP acquisition, reaching about 50% of total capital. This higher debt ratio increases financial risk, especially in a cyclical industry. Management noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call that debt reduction is a priority.
* **Cash Flows:**  Free cash flow has been volatile and difficult to predict, a reflection of the industry's cyclicality. Free cash flow was $311 million in 2020, -$144 million in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2022. Halliburton mentioned in the Q4 2022 earnings call that free cash flow improvement is crucial for shareholder returns.

**Valuation ($38.7 Billion):**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Halliburton, focusing on free cash flow to the firm. The valuation methodology used is as described in *Valuation*. 

{: .warning }

Given the industry's cyclicality, it is crucial to avoid excessively optimistic forecasts.  We adopt a pessimistic perspective.
We use Halliburton's financials from its 2019 to 2022 10K filings and its 2023 Q2 report. The assumptions we make for growth, margin and ROIC are lower than the average of those years.


* **Forecast Period:** 5 years. 
* **Growth:**  Revenue growth of 3% annually during the forecast period, then declining to 1% in perpetuity. (Justification: The global economy is facing significant headwinds, including geopolitical tensions, and there is a risk that this may negatively affect energy demand and therefore also the oil and gas industry.)
* **Margins:**  Adjusted operating margin of 17% (Justification: Management expects margins to be in the low 20s by 2026, but given the cyclicality of the industry, 17% is more reasonable, and below the margin of the last few years.)
* **ROIC:** 16%. (Justification: Given the business risk and the uncertainty of reinvestment returns, we will assume this modest ROIC to remain stable).
* **Cost of Capital:**  8.5% (Justification: Based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4.5% ,  beta of 1.2 and debt cost of 6% )
* **Terminal Value:**  Calculated using a perpetuity growth model.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation:** The FCF formula used in Valuation is: FCF = NOPLAT \* (1-Rein. Rate) + Dep. & Amor. - Incremental WC - Capex. This FCF formula can also be written as FCF=EBIT*(1-t)+Depreciation - Change in noncash WC - Capex. The FCF for each year using this methodology is given in the table below. Note: FCF is in Millions, Year 11 represents continuing value.

| Year | FCF  |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1691  |
| 2 | 1753  |
| 3 | 1816  |
| 4 | 1880  |
| 5 | 1946  |
| 11 | 21,887 |


2. **Present Value of FCF:**  Discount each year's FCF at the cost of capital to arrive at its present value. The present value of the continuing value is calculated separately and then discounted back to the present.

| Year | PV of FCF |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1,556  |
| 2 | 1,432 |
| 3 | 1,317  |
| 4 | 1,211 |
| 5 | 1,113 |
| 11 | 22,093 |


3. **Enterprise Value:** The sum of the present values of the FCFs during the explicit forecast period and the continuing value = $28,722 million.

4. **Equity Value:** 
    * Add cash and marketable securities = $279 million
    * Subtract Debt = -$11.6 billion
    * Subtract minority interest = -$50 million
    * Subtract value of employee stock options = $181 million
    * This results in an equity value of $17,366 million.

5. **Value per Share:** Divide equity value by the number of shares outstanding (1,011 million) to arrive at a value per share of **$17.18**.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

Halliburton's share price could benefit from a sustained increase in oil and gas prices, driven by factors such as geopolitical instability or supply disruptions. As discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call, management believes that the current oil and gas market is tight, with pricing power remaining strong. Continued debt reduction could also improve investor sentiment and reduce financial risk. 

{: .important }

However, as highlighted in Fisher's *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*, a critical factor in assessing the attractiveness of a stock is not simply its business or sector but the management's willingness to reinvest earnings efficiently. The company's heavy dependence on the North American energy market for both revenue and growth limits the potential for high catalyst rating.


**Recent Concerns:**

* **Inflationary Pressures:**  As noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call, input cost inflation is a concern.  Halliburton is actively managing its pricing and cost structure to mitigate this risk, but it faces the challenge of striking the right balance between cost recovery and customer satisfaction, which in itself is a balancing act.
* **Geopolitical Risks:** The war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions could negatively affect energy demand and create uncertainty in the oil services market.
* **Environmental Regulations:** Increasingly stringent environmental regulations could increase costs for Halliburton.
* **International Business Exposure:** As mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call, Halliburton sees signs of softness in its international business, which poses a short-term concern.


**Conclusion:**

{: .highlight }

This valuation suggests that Halliburton is fairly valued at its current price. Although its current valuation is somewhat better than its trading price, given the cyclical nature of the industry and Halliburton's heavy dependence on the North American energy market, it might be some time before the share price reflects its fair value. Additionally, a 3/5 catalyst rating doesn't offer too much promise for significant short-term share price movement. Consequently, this report comes down on the side of caution, favoring a more conservative assessment of the company's future prospects. There simply isn't enough margin of safety to inspire enthusiasm. However, it can still be a decent addition to an already diversified portfolio at the current price range.
