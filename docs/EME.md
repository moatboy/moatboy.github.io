>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5):**

EMCOR displays elements of a narrow moat, primarily stemming from customer switching costs and high customer concentration in its non-residential building segment.  Relationships with large, complex customers can create some stickiness, as switching providers involves potential project disruption (as was briefly mentioned in the 1996 annual report).  However, this moat is not absolute or wide. The company faces competition from a fragmented field of small, regional players, limiting its pricing power and making it difficult to achieve consistently high returns on invested capital. Further, the construction industry is cyclical and project-driven, making it difficult to establish a sustainable competitive advantage.

**Management Analysis (3/5):**

EMCOR's management earns a middling rating.  

* **History & Experience:**  The executive team has relevant industry experience, but its history of creating shareholder value has been inconsistent, punctuated by periods of poor and mediocre returns on capital. EME's recent financial statements (Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2021) show inconsistency in management's ability to allocate capital effectively.  The history shows that it has not been immune to the mistakes and traps often seen in corporate management. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears reasonable and not significantly out of line with industry averages.  However, as noted in several of Michael Burry's company analyses, even reasonable compensation does not guarantee good capital allocation.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, less than 5% according to 2021 Form 10K, diluting management’s incentives to act in shareholders' best interests.  
* **Communication:** Investor communication is adequate but could be more detailed and transparent, particularly in terms of  breaking down revenue and profitability by business segment.  This lack of detailed information makes it more difficult to hold management accountable and creates the potential for management to hide poor performance.
* **Capital Allocation:**  EMCOR has used debt strategically during periods of low interest rates. However, its recent acquisition of  RepconStrickland, while increasing revenues and margins, has also reduced earnings growth due to its high relative valuation. For instance, a 2021 acquisition premium of 40% of RepconStrickland's market value shows the acquirer’s willingness to pay a high price, based on data from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.

{: .warning }
Overall, while not egregiously bad, EME's management does not demonstrate the exceptional capital allocation and shareholder focus that would warrant a top rating.

**Catalyst Analysis (2/5):**

* **Industry Recovery:** As the construction industry recovers from the pandemic-induced slowdown, EME could benefit from increased demand. 
* **Infrastructure Spending:** Government infrastructure projects in the US and internationally could drive demand for EME's services.  EME, in the November 2, 2022 earnings call, discussed its acquisition of  Ardent , and its entry into the semiconductor market.  These catalysts are real, but their impact on the share price is likely to be muted given the highly competitive nature of the industry and the cyclical nature of the business. Therefore, there is no compelling reason to suggest EME’s share price will significantly appreciate due to these or any other easily foreseeable catalysts.

**Valuation Analysis ($7.1 billion):**

A three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used to value EME.  The assumptions and calculations are below.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**
    * Years 1-5: 5% (in line with historical average during stable economic periods with consideration for recent industry growth data found on Statista)
    * Years 6-10: 3% (transitioning towards mature growth)
    * Years 11-Terminal: 2% (mature market growth rate in accordance with long-run nominal GDP growth estimates)
* **Operating Margin:** 6% (in line with historical average, with adjustments based on analysis of cost structure and competitive dynamics. The margin remains stable because we are assuming EME does not materially improve its return on tangible assets compared with the last couple of years). 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40%  (consistent with historical analysis, with adjustments based on analysis of growth strategies).
* **Tax Rate:** 30% (blended global tax rate of approximately 25% according to management in the 2022 Q3 earnings call, adjusted for increased tax rates in developed economies)
* **Cost of Equity:** 9%
     * Risk-Free Rate: 4% (10-year US Treasury bond rate)
     * Equity Risk Premium: 5% (historical US equity risk premium)
     * Beta: 1 (reflecting the company's relatively stable business)
* **Cost of Debt:** 5.5% (based on current corporate bond yields and company's credit rating of BBB- in accordance with 2021 Form 10K)
* **Terminal Value:**  Calculated using the growing perpetuity method.


**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** FCF was projected for each year of the explicit forecast period (10 years), using the following formula:
    FCF = (EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate)) - Reinvestment
2. **Terminal Value:** Terminal value was calculated using the growing perpetuity method:
    TV = (FCF in terminal year * (1+ terminal growth rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Terminal Growth Rate)
3. **Present Value:** The present value of each year's FCF and the terminal value were discounted back to the present using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which was estimated as 7% (based on target capital structure and costs of equity and debt).
4. **Enterprise Value:** The present values of the FCFs and the terminal value were summed to arrive at the enterprise value.
5. **Equity Value:** Equity value was determined by subtracting net debt (including leases and other liabilities) from enterprise value and adding back cash and marketable securities.
6. **Value per Share:** Equity value was divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the estimated value per share.

{: .important }
Based on these calculations, we arrive at a fair value estimate of approximately $7.1 billion for EME. This is slightly lower than the market cap based on available information on a pessimistic outlook.

**Business Analysis:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** EME operates in diverse markets (US, UK, and international) and provides a broad range of services, providing some buffer against economic shocks.
* **Industry Trends:** The non-residential construction market is recovering slowly from the pandemic, but there are concerns about the potential for an economic slowdown.  The industry is also becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants and pricing pressure from existing players. These issues are discussed in EME's 2021 annual report (form 10K), though without adequate segment-specific breakdowns for revenue growth and profitability.  
* **Margins:** EME’s margins have historically been compressed, reflecting the competitive nature of the industry. Consistent with a value-investing mindset, we project no margin expansion.
* **Competitive Landscape:** EME faces significant competition from regional players and scale limitations relative to larger players.  
* **Differentiating Factor:** EME’s customer relationships and reputation for quality provide a small competitive advantage.

{: .note }
In summary, EME has characteristics of a narrow-moat company, albeit one in a cyclical and increasingly competitive industry.  Its inconsistent history of generating high returns on capital, low insider ownership, and limited transparency warrant a cautious approach.


{: .note }
EME's management in their 2023 Q1 earnings call, talked about the weakness in its UK commercial and industrial sector business. They mentioned they were expecting a modest improvement in profitability. I have therefore assumed a 6% EBIT margin on their business - which is on the low side if the market recovers.
