   *   Operating earnings in Q3 2023 was $197 million, down 35% compared to $303 million in Q3 2022.

{: .note }

{: .note }

## Moat Rating: 2.5/5
Based on the above analysis, Brunswick has a moderate moat that earns a rating of 2.5 out of 5, with justification listed below:

**Sources of Moat**:
* **Strong Brands**: Brunswick's diverse brand portfolio offers a competitive advantage. The company has many strong brands in multiple industries. Brands such as Mercury Marine are very strong.
* **Economies of Scale:** As a major player in the marine market, the scale of its operations provides cost advantages. Due to high fixed costs in manufacturing engines and boats, there are significant economies of scale for large players like Brunswick.
* **Distribution Networks**: The extensive network of dealers and distributors is hard to replicate and provides Brunswick with a sustainable edge, however with the rise of e-commerce, the value of distribution network is declining.
* **Switching Costs**: Customers who buy products from brands like Mercury will continue to buy parts from them, due to the compatibility and quality of the products.
* **Unique Technology:** A strong investment in R&D provides new technology and innovations that help secure a better advantage.

**Weaknesses**:
* **Cyclical Demand**: The business is subject to the demand cycles of the marine market, which makes it unpredictable and vulnerable.
* **Commodity-Like Products:** Though a premium can be charged, it is still very hard to differentiate between the products in terms of raw materials. The commodity type products might make it hard for Brunswick to keep an edge due to low switching costs.
* **Technological Disruption:** Changing technologies like Electric Boats might displace and shrink their internal combustion engine businesses.

## Legitimate Risks that could Harm the Moat and the Business
* **Economic Downturns**: The cyclical nature of the industry means that a recession will cause reduced spending on discretionary items like boats, engines, and accessories.
* **High Inflation:** A rise in the cost of raw materials may increase production costs and reduce profitability, thus affecting sales.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Disruptions in the global supply chains could hurt production and increase input costs.
* **Technological Disruption:** The rise of electrical boats may damage the demand for their legacy products that require gasoline.
* **Competitive Actions**: New companies that are able to compete or imitate some of Brunswick's products might threaten its position in the future.
* **Legal and Regulatory Risks**: Changes in local and international regulation may increase costs and change current profitability.

## Business Resilience
- **Brands**: The strong brands owned by Brunswick can help the company weather a downturn and prevent large drops in sales.
- **Diversification:** A diverse portfolio of different types of boats, engines, parts, and accessories ensures they can weather adverse effects in any specific segment.
- **Financial Stability:** Overall the company has shown strong profitability and consistent cash flow creation, that can allow for long term growth plans to continue.

## Understandability: 2/5

Brunswick's business is moderately complex and requires a good level of knowledge in the areas of manufacturing, retail, and distribution of marine-based products. Understanding the company fully would require more than basic analysis of their business.

*   The company operates in a rather niche market which makes it difficult to follow compared to other more popular markets.
*   It has multiple divisions that each operate in a different way, making analyzing its overall profitability a bit more complex.
*   The use of multiple different segments makes it hard to analyze a clear picture without significant time spent analyzing the details.

## Balance Sheet Health: 4/5
Brunswick's balance sheet is overall healthy. While the level of debt is relatively high, the company generates sufficient cash to handle the debt.

*   Positive cash generation means the business is very healthy and able to handle debt.
*    Strong profitability means that the business can use cash flow to increase its current position in the future.
*   A slight increase in inventories might mean increased production of goods, signaling increasing demand.
*   Debt is at relatively higher levels, which might indicate slightly higher risk profile but is also manageable with their current cash flows.

Overall, Brunswick is a company with a moderately defensible moat, as it has high brand recognition and is adapting its business to new trends in the market. However, it faces some threats due to its cyclical nature and the rise of competitors. The strong financial results, along with improving sales in its propulsion segment, are positives for the company and give good assurance to investors that the company is fundamentally sound and has good long term potential. However, a deeper dive into the balance sheets and an understanding of all its segments is important to make a clear judgement about investing in the company.
