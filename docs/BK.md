{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat: 3/5 (Narrow)**

QSR's moat rests primarily on its intangible assets—its brand names. These brands, particularly Burger King and Tim Hortons, have strong recognition and customer loyalty in their respective markets. However, the QSR space is notoriously competitive, with low switching costs for consumers and a constant influx of new concepts.  This limits the pricing power of even the most established brands.  While Popeyes has experienced a recent surge in popularity, its long-term staying power remains to be seen. Firehouse Subs is a relatively small player in the highly competitive sandwich segment.  Therefore, a rating of 3 out of 5 reflecting a narrow moat is warranted.

**Management: 2/5**

Management's quality is a key concern for QSR.  While there has been a focus on cost-cutting and franchisee profitability, there have been missteps as well.

* **History/Experience:**  The company has shuffled CEOs several times since 3G Capital's acquisition.  The current CEO, Joshua Kobza,  was previously the COO. He had a solid performance in the post and is familiar with the industry - but he lacks the extensive long-term CEO experience that would inspire full confidence. 
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is heavily weighted towards stock options, potentially incentivizing short-term decisions to boost share price at the expense of long-term value creation.  (Q1 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Communication/Transparency:**  While management provides regular updates and guidance, the level of transparency and detail provided in financial reports could be significantly improved.  For instance, it is still difficult to get a detailed breakdown of financial performance by individual brand - which can make proper competitive analysis challenging.

These factors together with a highly leveraged balance sheet merit a cautious management rating of 2 out of 5.

**Catalyst: 2/5**

Potential catalysts for QSR include:

* **International Expansion:** QSR has significant opportunities for international growth, particularly in emerging markets.  However, success in these markets is not guaranteed and requires careful execution.
* **Brand Revitalization:** Management is working on revitalizing its core brands, particularly Burger King, through menu innovation and store remodels. Success is not assured, but if management can gain traction, it could boost same-store sales and profitability. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Digital Transformation:** QSR is investing in digital technology to enhance the customer experience and drive sales.  However, all other restaurant chains are doing the same and there is little evidence that the company will be able to create or sustain a digital competitive advantage.


Overall, the catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** QSR generates revenue primarily through franchise fees and royalties, with a smaller portion coming from company-owned restaurants. Tim Hortons and Burger King make up the substantial proportion of overall sales, and the two brands face saturation in many markets.
* **Industry Trends:** The QSR industry is highly competitive, with low switching costs and continuous innovation in products and services.
* **Margins:**  QSR operates with a relatively high operating margin thanks to its franchise model, but competition and input costs pressure profitability.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Major competitors include McDonald's, Yum! Brands, and Starbucks.
* **Differentiation:**  QSR’s brands are generally not sufficiently differentiated to command premium prices and margins, as discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. There are too many substitutes in the hamburger, coffee and donut space. While Popeyes has differentiated itself from competitors with its spicy chicken sandwich, it is unclear if this temporary advantage is sustainable over the long run.

**Financials:**

QSR has been growing its revenue and earnings consistently over the past few years. However, it is still difficult to find much operating cash or profit margin expansion.

A concerning aspect of QSR's financials is its high level of debt and the associated interest expense.  The high debt load could limit the company's financial flexibility in the future.  (Q3 2023 Earnings Call)

**Valuation:**

To value QSR, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model will be used, specifically the enterprise DCF model. The method uses the value driver model by Mckinsey & Co described in *Valuation* as it does a good job of connecting long-term fundamentals to more accessible measures of company performance.  Given the management's past emphasis on short-term EPS growth and share price - a pessimistic and skeptical outlook will be taken for assumptions to build in a margin of safety.  

**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2 percent annually over the next 5 years, then 1 percent in perpetuity (slightly below the long-run historical average of US GDP growth)
* **Operating Margin:** 30 percent (in line with pre-COVID values, and less than the margins at more successful franchise businesses like McDonald's)
* **Sales to Capital:** 2.0 (reflects low capital intensity)
* **Tax Rate:** 25%
* **Cost of Equity:** 9.5% (Risk-free rate of 4% + market risk premium of 5% + beta of 1.1)
* **Cost of Debt:** 6.5% (in line with the company’s recent borrowing costs)
* **Probability of Failure:** 10% in year 5.
* **Liquidation Value:**  $4.5 billion (roughly the amount of cash on the balance sheet.)

**These pessimistic growth and margin assumptions reflect the intense competition in the QSR space and the challenges of maintaining high growth at scale.**

**Calculations:**

* **NOPLAT** 
    * The company’s average effective tax rate over the past 3 years is approximately 20%. Assuming after-tax operating income of $3.1 billion and revenues of $6.3 billion, we calculate implied pre-tax operating income of $3.875 billion.  $3.875/6.3 = 61.5% Margin.
    * Given an effective tax rate of 25% and 2% revenue growth, pre-tax operating income is $3.952, $4.031, $4.112, $4.195 and $4.280 in years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
    * Applying the 25% tax rate yields after-tax operating income of $2.964, $3.023, $3.084, $3.146 and $3.210
    * Terminal Value: ($3.210 \* 1.01)/(.095-.01) = $38.755 billion

* **Reinvestment:**
    * Using Sales to Capital of 2.0x,  Capital in 2024 is 4.280/2 = $2.14 Billion
    * Reinvestment = New Capital - Depreciation
    * Using 4% as depreciation rate, depreciation =  2.14 \* .04 = $0.085 billion
    * New Capital =  4.280 * .02/2 + 0.085 = $0.129 billion
    * Reinvestment Rate =  0.129 / 3.210 = 4%

* **Free Cash Flow to Firm:**
    * Free cash flow to firm (FCFF) equals NOPLAT plus depreciation minus capital expenditures and the change in noncash working capital. FCFF is projected to be $2.879, $2.938, $3.000, $3.062 and $3.124 billion, after backing out depreciation rate of 4%

* **Enterprise Value:**
    * Discounting each year’s FCFF at the WACC of 9.5% and adding them to the present value of the terminal value yields $37.8 billion.

{: .important }

**This $37.8 billion valuation, which approximates the current market cap, is quite sensitive to growth and margin assumptions.  If either of these drivers falters, the intrinsic value could decline rapidly.**

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Franchisee Relationships:** Burger King franchisees have been publicly feuding with management over pricing and promotions.  This needs to be resolved in a manner that satisfies both the company and its franchisees.  (Q4 2022 Earnings Call)
* **Inflation/Input Costs:**  Like all restaurant chains, QSR has been negatively impacted by rising input costs and higher labor costs. The ability of the company to pass along price increases to consumers is critical to maintaining its margins. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call)


**Final Words:**

QSR possesses some qualities of a strong business - established brands, a highly franchised model, and international growth opportunities. However, the management's track record and the high debt load merit a cautious outlook. Any potential investment in QSR needs to be made at an attractive price with a significant margin of safety to account for the inherent risks and uncertainties in the QSR space.
