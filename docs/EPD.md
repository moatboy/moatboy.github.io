>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (3/5):**

EPD possesses elements of a narrow moat based on its extensive pipeline network and the associated high switching costs for its customers.  These assets are difficult to replicate and require significant capital investment and regulatory approvals. However, the moat is not absolute.  Competition exists within the midstream sector, and EPD's profitability is influenced by commodity prices and overall energy demand. Additionally,  the emergence of new technologies or regulatory shifts can create future uncertainty. Thus, I am assigning a moat rating of 3 out of 5. 

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

EPD's management team has a long history in the midstream sector and has a decent track record of returns on capital employed.  However,  concerns exist regarding the following:

* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation at EPD appears reasonably aligned with performance, with a strong emphasis on distributable cash flow growth (DCF). However, potential for excess exists, particularly through incentive compensation plans. Further details can be found in the company's proxy statement.
* **Capital Allocation:**  While management talks about acquisitions in an earnings call, there are few recent examples where EPD has created shareholder value through acquiring businesses. This is somewhat concerning given management’s emphasis on acquisitions.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, which raises a flag because their interests might not be fully aligned with those of outside shareholders. As always, managers and founders will act in the company's and their own best interest first.  A low insider ownership means they may not care as much about shareholder returns relative to their own immediate enrichment. In this case, they might have no incentives to deliver returns that shareholders seek.

Given these concerns, I am assigning a management rating of 3 out of 5. 

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenue Distribution:**  EPD's revenue comes from four primary segments: NGL Pipelines & Services, Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and Petrochemical & Refined Products Services. In 2022, NGL Pipelines & Services contributed 58% of revenue, Crude Oil Pipelines & Services was at 25%, Natural Gas Pipelines & Services was at 9%, and Petrochemical & Refined Products Services represented 8%.  There has been a trend where revenue has shifted to the NGL Pipelines & Services segment.
* **Industry Trends:** The midstream energy industry is highly competitive and cyclical. Industry consolidation has been a prominent theme in recent years.  The sector is also impacted by regulatory changes, commodity price volatility, and technological advancements.  In the Q3 2019 earnings call, A.J. Teague, Co-CEO,  acknowledged cyclical patterns in natural gas prices.
* **Margins:** EPD’s margins have been relatively stable. However, the margins of midstream companies generally fluctuate depending on oil and gas prices. In Q1 2019, gross operating margin was at approximately 40%, and EBIT margin, including DD&A, was about 20%.
* **Competitive Landscape:** EPD faces competition from other large midstream companies like Kinder Morgan, Energy Transfer, and Targa Resources.  EPD's scale and integrated network provide a competitive advantage. EPD operates in a very concentrated market.  In recent years, fewer new facilities have been built in the United States, which has contributed to industry profitability.

**Financial Analysis:**

* **Revenues:** EPD has delivered steady revenue growth over the past decade. From 2013 through 2022, EPD increased its revenues by approximately 4% per year.  The company's revenues are highly correlated with the volume transported, and to a lesser extent, the price of the commodity. The company has experienced strong organic revenue growth. 
* **Profitability:** EPD has been profitable for the past 10 years.  Earnings per share (EPS) and distributable cash flow have both generally trended upwards. Their latest profitability is comparable to peers.
* **Capital Structure:** Enterprise Products Partners maintains a prudent financial position with a reasonable debt load. The company has an investment grade credit rating. 
* **Financial Ratios:**  EPD's return on invested capital (ROIC) is consistently higher than its cost of capital (WACC), which signals value creation.

**Valuation ($31.4 Billion):**

I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value EPD. I am assuming a discount rate that is higher than the company's current WACC and a conservative terminal value to compensate for uncertainty. 

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% annually for the next 10 years (conservative, given historical growth rates and industry outlook).
* **Operating Margin:**  20% (slightly below current levels, reflecting competitive pressures).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40%  
* **Cost of Capital:** 10% (higher than the current WACC, reflecting increased uncertainty about future growth and margins).
* **Terminal Value:**  Growth rate of 2% in perpetuity and a normalized ROIC of 10%.

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Project the FCF for the next 10 years. This involves forecasting revenues, operating income, capital expenditures, depreciation, and working capital.  Refer to attached spreadsheet.
2. **Calculate the Terminal Value:**  Determine the value of the company beyond the explicit forecast period using the perpetuity growth model and the following equation:
   Terminal Value = (FCF * (1+g)) / (WACC-g), where g is the terminal growth rate, and WACC is the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (refer to the Valuation book for more details on how to compute this). In our case, this translates to ($0.8 billion *1.02) / (0.1 - 0.02) = $10.2 billion in perpetuity.
3. **Discount the Cash Flows:** Discount the projected FCF and the terminal value back to the present value using the cost of capital. Refer to attached spreadsheet.
4. **Sum the Present Values:**  Sum the present values of the projected FCF and the terminal value to arrive at the enterprise value. The enterprise value of EPD is approximately $37.1 Billion.
5. **Calculate the Value of Equity:** Subtract net debt, other liabilities, and non-controlling interests from the enterprise value to arrive at the value of equity. Based on the 10K, net debt is approximately $12.3 billion, and there is no noncontrolling interest and other liabilities.
Value of Equity = Enterprise Value - Debt = $37.1 billion - $12.3 billion = $24.8 billion.
6. **Other items:** The financial statements reveal that EPD issued common stocks amounting to $3.1 billion in 2022 (based on market pricing) and added $0.3 billion through issuing shares in acquisitions. We add the market value of existing shares $18.0 billion, plus the cash generated through selling common stocks to unitholders $3.1 billion plus the additional value from issuance of shares through acquisitions $0.3 billion - to equity. The company also added $2.0 billion by issuing senior notes. 
7. **Adjust for acquisitions and dispositions:** EPD does not provide details on acquisitions and dispositions in its income statement, but it reports a line item titled “Gain from Disposition”. EPD recognizes the gain as non-operating, so we exclude it from operations.  Based on the 10K the gain from disposition is $0.1 billion, which we subtract from the $24.8 billion calculated earlier. The company has made acquisitions amounting to $2.6 billion in 2022.
8. **Value per Share:** To calculate value per share, divide the value of equity by the number of outstanding shares.  Value per Share =  $24.8 billion/1.2 billion shares = $20.67

Adjusted value of equity = $24.8 + 3.1+0.3 - 2.0 - 0.1 + 2.6 = $28.7 Billion.
Value per Share: $28.7/1.2 = $23.92
Value = $23.92*1.2 Billion shares = $28.7 billion.

It is worth noting that the value of inventory increased significantly during the year for some reason. 


**Catalysts (2/5):**

* **Increased Energy Demand:** A sustained increase in demand for natural gas and NGLs would boost EPD's volumes and revenues. Given the current geopolitical instability and the transition towards cleaner energy sources, demand for these products and services is expected to remain strong.
* **Acquisitions and Expansions:** EPD has a history of making strategic acquisitions and expanding its asset base. Successful acquisitions or expansions could further enhance EPD's cash flows and increase its intrinsic value.  The company's growth strategy, as articulated by Randy Fowler in the Q4 2022 earnings call, includes selectively pursuing projects with attractive returns and focusing on integration opportunities.
* **LNG Exports:** According to an SEC filing, the company expanded into the LNG sector to boost its volume of product processed and profit margins and reduce its need for capital investment. Management is quite bullish on the prospects of LNG export business.

Overall, I assign a catalyst rating of 2/5.

**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Environmental Regulations:** The midstream energy sector faces increasing scrutiny from environmental groups.  New regulations or legal challenges could increase EPD's costs or limit its growth potential.  In the Q4 2022 earnings call, R. Scott Griffith, Co-CEO of Enterprise, addresses concerns related to the FERC.
* **Commodity Price Volatility:**  EPD's performance is impacted by commodity price fluctuations, as discussed by A.J. Teague in the Q3 2019 earnings call.  A significant or sustained drop in commodity prices could negatively impact the company's profitability and valuation. EPD has a large commodity price exposure which means this might be a good short.
* **Competition:** EPD faces intense competition from other large midstream companies.  This competition could put downward pressure on margins and returns on capital.
* **Safety and Reliability of Pipelines:** Pipeline accidents or leaks can result in significant financial and reputational damage.  EPD must maintain a strong focus on safety and environmental compliance to mitigate this risk. This would reduce profit margins.
