>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5): Narrow**

Ericsson's moat primarily stems from high switching costs and network effects within specific segments of the telecommunications equipment market, particularly with its existing customer base.  Long-term contracts and integration of its equipment into client networks make switching suppliers costly and disruptive.  However, this moat is limited due to:

* **Intense competition:**  The telecom equipment market is highly competitive, with rivals like Nokia, Huawei, and Samsung constantly vying for market share.  This limits pricing power and forces constant innovation, which can be costly. This is evident in Ericsson's lower margins, as compared to those of companies with wider moats.  As discussed in _The Little Book of Valuation_ and _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies,_ competition reduces excess returns. 
* **Technological disruption:** The industry is susceptible to rapid technological change, which can erode existing advantages.  The shift to 5G has created new opportunities, but also necessitates constant reinvestment to remain competitive.  This necessitates investments in R&D at a significant level, thus limiting capital available for other opportunities for growth and for shareholders.
* **Customer concentration:**  Reliance on a few large telecom customers can create vulnerability. Loss of a major customer could materially damage business performance and thus valuation, especially for a company without multiple steady revenue sources.
* **Geographic concentration of revenues:** Although Ericsson operates globally, its revenue streams are not as well-diversified as its geographic spread.  This can impact performance, as discussed in _The Little Book of Valuation._ For instance, in Q2 2024, revenue in North America showed a healthy growth of 11% Y/Y (2023 Annual Report) despite economic concerns in North America.  At the same time, Network sales in North East Asia were down 39% Y/Y(2023 Annual Report). While management explained that the macroeconomic climate was primarily the reason, it highlights the problems associated with significant regional reliance.

**Management (2/5):  Middling**

While Ericsson has experienced leadership changes recently, including the appointment of Börje Ekholm as CEO and Carl Melltorp as CFO, several factors lead to a below-average management rating.

* **Capital allocation:**  Ericsson has made significant acquisitions, such as Vonage, but returns from these capital expenditures have been disappointing, creating a drag on profitability. As highlighted in _The Little Book of Valuation_ acquisitions need to increase the value of operations dramatically in order to generate excess return to shareholders of acquiring company. Management's aggressive push into acquisitions during periods of high valuation, like the recent one, is a warning flag.
* **Compensation:**  The high value placed on stock options (2023 Annual Report) as part of executive compensation, without any clawback provisions, can incentivize short-term decision-making. This is also evident in the company buying back its shares when its share price was trading at a multiple of 20 times, as pointed out by Michael Burry in his MSN Money article.
* **Communication:** While Ericsson provides detailed reporting, there is still a lack of transparency regarding its investor base and detailed performance measures for different segments. It would give better insight to investors if there were more detailed disclosure of how exactly Ericsson creates value, as suggested by _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies_.
* **Insider ownership:** A very low level of insider ownership (less than 1%) by both senior managers and directors further reduces confidence.  As we learn from Pat Dorsey's _The Little Book that Builds Wealth_, ownership mentality gives a significant competitive advantage.

**Catalyst (3/5): Moderate**

Several potential catalysts could positively impact Ericsson’s share price:

* **5G rollout:**  Continued global rollout of 5G networks could drive demand for Ericsson’s equipment and services, though competition will remain intense.  Management has highlighted continued potential growth.  For instance, in the Q3 2024 earnings call, they highlighted how the mobile networks segment continued to grow, with operators making significant investments for 5G.
* **Cost-cutting initiatives:** The company has initiated cost-cutting measures in response to the declining market. If these prove successful, profitability could improve, potentially boosting the share price, but historical performance creates doubts on management's ability to follow through on cost-cutting. For instance, in the Q1 2024 earnings call, management stated that operating expenses declined thanks to cost saving activities, yet, gross margin decreased and operating margin before restructuring remained the same.
* **New CEO:** As highlighted in the 29 October 2024 press release, the newly appointed CEO Börje Ekholm has significant experience and success within the telecommunications industry, having been Chairman of Ericsson for almost a decade, as well as CEO of Investor AB, Ericsson's largest owner. His new strategy, with a defined focus on process and a more active approach, has the potential for a favorable outcome on Ericsson's performance in the coming years, but we remain skeptical based on the mediocre performance of Ericsson during Ekholm's time as Chairman of the Board.

**Valuation ($27.1 billion)**

{: .note }

We employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model using the key value driver formula, as recommended in _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies_ and _The Little Book of Valuation_, as it directly ties value to operating performance, using the formula:

**Value = NOPLAT<sub>t</sub>(1 - g/RONIC) / (Cost of Capital (WACC) - g)**

where:

* **NOPLAT<sub>t</sub>:** Net operating profit less adjusted taxes
* **g:** Expected growth rate in perpetuity
* **RONIC:** Return on new invested capital
* **WACC:** Weighted average cost of capital

We forecast an explicit 10-year period and a continuing-value period thereafter, as recommended in _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies_.
{: .warning }

To get a conservative estimate, we take a pessimistic outlook.

**Key Assumptions (Business as Usual):**

* **Revenue growth:**  Industry growth has been subdued in recent years, with 5G rollout driving new opportunities.  We assume a modest 3% annual revenue growth rate for the next 5 years and declining to 2% in perpetuity, matching expected long-run economic growth, after the initial boom period.
* **Operating margin:** Margins have been under pressure due to competition and investments. We assume a gradual improvement to a 12% pretax operating profit margin (2023 Annual Report) over the next 10 years, based on industry dynamics and management’s cost-cutting plans.
* **Reinvestment rate:** We calculate a reinvestment rate of 52% based on historical capital expenditure and net working capital investment trends.  We maintain that reinvestment rate through the forecast period.
* **Tax rate:** We use the 26.4% tax rate as it is the statutory rate in the Netherlands, where Heineken is domiciled. 

**Key Assumptions (Cost of Capital):**

* **Cost of debt:** We assume a cost of debt of 4.5% (2023 Annual Report), given Ericsson’s credit rating and the current risk-free rate.
* **Risk-free rate:** We use the current yield of a 10-year U.S. treasury bond (4.78% as of Nov 2024) as the risk-free rate.
* **Equity risk premium:**  We assume a risk premium of 5.5% based upon historical data.
* **Beta:** We estimate Ericsson’s beta at 0.92 based upon a regression of its stock returns against the market.
* **Capital structure:** Ericsson’s most recent financial statements report a debt to equity ratio of 55 to 45 and hence we use those weights for the cost of capital.

**Valuation Calculations:**

1. **Cost of equity = Risk-free rate + Beta * Equity risk premium = 4.78% + 0.92 * 5.5% = 9.84%**
2. **After-tax cost of debt = Cost of debt * (1 - tax rate) = 4.5% * (1 - 26.4%) = 3.31%**
3. **Cost of Capital (WACC) = (Weight of equity * Cost of equity) + (Weight of debt * After-tax cost of debt) = (55% * 9.84%) + (45% * 3.31%) =  6.91%**
4. **NOPLAT for year 1 = Net Income * (1+ expected growth rate) =  €1,885 m (2023 Annual Report) * 1.03 = €1,941.55 million**
5. **Continuing value (year 11):  CV = (NOPLAT<sub>11</sub> * (1 - g/RONIC)) / (WACC - g) = (€1,941.55 * (1 - 0.02 / 0.17)) / (0.0691 - 0.02) = €41,235 million**
6. **Present value of continuing value = €41,235 million / 1.0691^10 = €21,441 million**
7. **Present value of operating assets =  Sum of discounted cash flows for years 1 to 10 + PV of continuing value = (using the formula from "The Little Book of Valuation", the present value of each year is computed as NOPLAT * (1 + growth rate) / (1 + discount rate)^year and then we sum them over the 10 year period)+ €21,441 million = €27,138 million**

{: .warning }

Given the uncertainties in the model inputs, especially given the company’s recent challenges, this valuation could be significantly different.
{: .highlight }

We prefer a margin of safety while investing in growth stocks, as recommended in _The Intelligent Investor_. We recommend therefore that investors demand a discount to our estimate of value.
{: .important }

Given current economic uncertainties, and the industry's continuing transition to cloud, we would increase our required margin of safety, and demand therefore that the stock price trade below 80 percent of our valuation.
