>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** CMG's revenue primarily comes from its restaurant operations, divided into food, beverage, and other (delivery and convenience fees, restaurant royalties, and merchandise sales). As of December 31, 2022, restaurant sales accounted for approximately 99% of CMG's total revenue. The remaining 1% is attributed to the "Other" category. Over the past five years, CMG has witnessed substantial revenue growth, with a compound annual growth rate of 11.7% in revenues over 2018-2022. CMG's revenue grew 17.7% year over year in 2022 despite the ongoing economic slowdown and increase in input prices. Its focus on quality ingredients and premium menu offerings allows it to command higher prices.
* **Industry Trends:** The restaurant industry is highly competitive, characterized by low switching costs for consumers and low differentiation.  Success often hinges on delivering consistently dependable consumer experiences that drive loyalty. The industry is also subject to cyclical economic pressures that can impact consumer spending. Furthermore, fast-casual dining, especially the burger and pizza segments, have become commoditized. The industry has become less fragmented than in the past, with the emergence of large chains. Technological disruption through online ordering, food delivery services, and the use of social media is becoming increasingly relevant. 
* **Margins:** CMG's operating margin has been consistently strong, standing at 10.9% in 2022, compared with an average of 8.2% in the previous 4 years. This strong margin reflects its ability to charge premium prices for its high-quality offerings. However, operating margins are susceptible to rising food costs. CMG's strategy is to maintain its current operating margin through cost and menu optimization.
* **Geographic Location:** CMG’s operations are predominantly focused on North America. As of December 31, 2022, CMG had 3,227 company-owned restaurants in the United States, 53 company-owned restaurants in Canada, and 40 franchised restaurants across North America, Europe and the Middle East.

**Moat Analysis and Rating Justification**

While Chipotle benefits from some brand strength and customer loyalty, these attributes do not constitute a significant, durable competitive advantage in the highly competitive restaurant industry. 

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** CMG's brand is recognizable and associated with high-quality ingredients. However, brand loyalty in the fast-casual dining segment is limited, as evidenced by the success of other newer concepts.  The emergence of new restaurant concepts (including chains and independent restaurants) continually puts pressure on incumbents. Further, CMG’s brand is primarily a regional (North America) phenomenon.
* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs in the restaurant industry are minimal. Consumers can easily switch to competitors with little effort or cost.
* **Network Effect:** There is no network effect associated with Chipotle’s operations. The value derived from eating at Chipotle is independent of how many other customers are present.
* **Cost Advantage:** CMG does not have a significant cost advantage.  Its focus on high-quality ingredients limits its ability to compete on price with many lower-cost alternatives.
* **Scale:** Scale does offer some protection against competitors, especially in terms of distribution.  CMG’s national-level distribution network gives it some cost advantages and negotiating leverage with suppliers. However, this is not sufficient to create a wide moat. Further, CMG’s scale is much smaller than incumbents, such as McDonald’s.

>
{: .note } Given the limited brand strength, minimal switching costs, lack of network effect and cost advantages, and modest scale advantages, Chipotle is assigned a narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5. This reflects the competitive nature of the industry and the risk of disruption from competitors. This pessimistic view is taken because economic moats are more often fleeting than lasting.

**Valuation**

<details>
<summary>Valuation assumptions and calculations</summary>


A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model was used. The following are the key assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** We assumed modest revenue growth for CMG. Using the company's data in their financial filings for CMG and their reported data in Chipotle's latest 10-Ks, we expect revenues to grow at an annual rate of 2% over the next five years. This is a conservative estimate since CMG’s annualized revenue growth has averaged 11.7% over the previous 5 years. Since the overall U.S. casual dining market is projected to grow at roughly 3.3%, we expect CMG’s revenue growth will gradually decline from 2% to the average 3.3% once the company matures in years 10+
* **Margins:**  For consistency, we have assumed that operating margins will remain constant over the next 10 years. Although management says they plan on maintaining margins at current levels (10.9%), this pessimistic view assumes that the company’s operating margin will drop to 7% by year 10.
* **Sales to Invested Capital:** Given increasing competition for market share, we are assuming that the company’s efficiency will remain constant and ROIC will drop. This means that incremental sales-to-invested capital will equal to 3. In a restaurant business, reinvestment in assets needs to be made continually to accommodate expansion. This is especially important for CMG as it continues to open new restaurants. Therefore, we will model capital expenditure for existing units as depreciation. Using CMG's annualized depreciation for 2018–2022, we have assumed a depreciation rate of 2.6% over the next 10 years.

* **Reinvestment Rate:** We forecast reinvestment in property, plant, and equipment for new units using the perpetual growth reinvestment rate equation as follows: $Reinvestment=Growth\times\frac{S/IC}{ROIC-Growth}$

In 2023, for CMG, with 13.6% ROIC, 2.0% revenue growth rate, and S/IC of 2.5, the reinvestment rate is approximately 43.1%: $2.0\times\frac{2.5}{13.6-2.0}=0.431$. The reinvestment rate will gradually decline toward 3.3%, the perpetual reinvestment rate. 

* **Cost of Equity:** We estimate CMG’s after-tax cost of debt by first obtaining the yield to maturity on its long-term debt, then we adjust the risk-free rate, the market risk premium, and the equity beta.

CMG's long-term debt is in the form of unsecured notes. These unsecured notes are rated investment grade, AAA by Moody’s. CMG’s current debt is around $3.8bn (we will ignore the minor portion of capitalized leases). Based on the yield-to-maturity on Moody’s AAA rated bonds, with duration of 20 years, we assume 4.2% yield-to-maturity. Since the yield on a 20 year U.S. treasury is around 4%, CMG’s pretax cost of debt is therefore 0.2% above the risk-free rate.

Using an equity beta of 1.28, a market risk premium of 5.5%, and a risk-free rate of 4%, the cost of equity for CMG comes to approximately 11.1%. Given a 34.1% statutory tax rate, and a marginal tax rate of 34.1%, this leads to an after tax cost of debt of 2.77% (4.2% * (1-0.341)). Combining these inputs leads to the following weighted average cost of capital.

$WACC = \frac{3.8}{3.8 + 19.5}\times 0.0277+ \frac{19.5}{3.8+19.5}\times 0.111 = 0.098$ or 9.8%

* **Probability of failure:** Since CMG is a well-established restaurant, with strong operating performance and positive cash flows, the likelihood of the company failing in the next 10 years is low. However, given the current macroeconomic uncertainty and the fact that CMG is in a highly competitive industry, we have conservatively assigned it a 2% risk of failure. 

* **Liquidation value** in case of failure: We have assumed conservatively that the proceeds from liquidation would be around 10% of its present value.

* **Terminal value:** Given our assumption that operating margins and sales-to-invested capital will stabilize after 10 years, we have assumed a 3.3% terminal growth rate and a return on new invested capital equal to the cost of capital (WACC) of 9.8%

$Terminal \ Value = \frac{EBIT_{\ terminal \ year}*(1-Tax)*(1 - Reinvestment)}{WACC – Growth}$

$Terminal \ Value = \frac{825.05*(1-0.341)*(1-0.033)}{0.098 – 0.033} = \$4,946 \ million$

</center>

* **Present value of cash flows:** $21,105 million

* **Terminal Value:** $4,946 million
$Discounted \ Terminal \ Value=Terminal \ value/ (1 + cost \ of \ capital)^n$

$Discounted \ Terminal \ Value = 4,946/1.098^{10} = \$1,910$ million

* **Value of operating assets (business):** $21,105 + $1,910 = \$23,015 million

* **Value of nonoperating assets:** We use CMG's current nonoperating assets. $823 million in cash.

* **Value of Debt:** From company annual filings we use the company's year-end debt value.  We can value debt at its present value rather than book value, but using book value is also a reasonable choice. $3.8 Billion

* **Value of Equity:** \$23.015 + 0.823 - 3.8 = $20.038 Billion

* **Number of shares outstanding:** $120.06 million

* **Value per share:** $20.038 billion / $120.06 million = \$167/share. Given current market price of $1704, CMG's shares look slightly overvalued.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Management:** CMG’s management appears to be focused on growth, particularly international market expansion.  Growth is necessary for value creation for CMG, but growth does not necessarily translate into value creation. Management must also consider profitability, and how the firm manages its margins relative to competitors to see if its strategy is likely to succeed in the restaurant industry over the long term. It is not clear whether current management's current focus on customer acquisition, which involves substantial capital outlays, will eventually improve its profitability and deliver returns to investors.
* **Risks:** A good management must be willing to forgo easy short-term returns if they come at the expense of putting the company on a sound financial footing.  CMG's high reliance on delivery services raises risks concerning order fulfillment and fulfillment costs. This also impacts the customer’s experience due to increased delivery costs and longer delivery times. CMG's sensitivity to economic downturns and to food input prices is also a major risk for the company going forward.
* **Capital Allocation:** The company is generating substantial free cash flows, and repurchasing shares and paying special dividends. However, management’s biggest investments have been toward stock buybacks and dividends.  It has purchased $1.004bn worth of company shares over the past year. (This represents over 31% of its market capitalization.) CMG has the funds to make large investments in its business, but instead, it throws the excess profits at a questionable line of business with no moat.

>
{: .warning } In conclusion, while Chipotle has a recognizable brand and a loyal customer base, its lack of a durable competitive advantage and current overvaluation make it an unattractive investment at current prices. The company's future success hinges on its ability to maintain margins in the face of rising competition and changing consumer preferences, as well as management's ability to allocate capital effectively.
