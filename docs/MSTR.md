{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

MicroStrategy has a limited moat, primarily derived from switching costs.  While its enterprise customers face costs and disruption from switching BI platforms, this lock-in is not as strong as it once was.  The rise of cloud-based BI solutions and increasing competition from larger players like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Tableau weaken this advantage.  There are no significant network effects or cost advantages evident.  Thus, its moat rating is a low **1 out of 5**.

{: .warning }

Switching costs, while present, are declining in strength as cloud-based software becomes easier to adopt. This is a key risk to the business.
 

**Management:**

MicroStrategy's management rating is **2 out of 5**. While the company has shown historical success and Phong Le, the current CEO, has a decade of experience at the company (including as CFO), its recent strategic shift towards Bitcoin raises significant concerns.

* **History:**  The company was a dominant player in the BI space before the rise of cloud computing but failed to adapt quickly enough, leading to a decline in performance and market share. (Source: Company Filings and Earnings Calls)
* **Experience:**  Phong Le has experience navigating the company through financial challenges. However, his expertise is primarily in finance, not in developing new product lines to compete in a changing technological landscape. (Source: Company Filings and Earnings Calls)
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears reasonable, but stock-based compensation is significant. (Source: Company Proxy Filings)
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is high, particularly by Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman. However, Mr. Saylor's aggressive bets on Bitcoin have introduced significant volatility and risk into the company. (Source: Company Filings and Earnings Calls)
* **Communication:** While the company provides detailed financial disclosures, its focus on Bitcoin in investor communications and promotion often overshadows the core business, making it harder for investors to assess its performance and prospects. (Source: Company Investor Relations and Earnings Calls)
* **Capital Allocation:** The company's significant investment in Bitcoin has introduced substantial risk to the business and could potentially impair capital. MicroStrategy has taken on significant debt to fund its Bitcoin purchases, increasing its financial risk profile. This heavy reliance on a single, volatile asset is a significant risk to the company's long-term financial health. (Source: Company Filings and Earnings Calls)

{: .important }

The company's large Bitcoin holdings and related debt introduce substantial risk and volatility, impacting its financial stability and obscuring the underlying business performance. This is a key factor in the low management rating.
 

**Catalyst:**

MicroStrategy's catalyst rating is **3 out of 5**.

* **Bitcoin Price Appreciation:** A significant catalyst for the stock price is the potential for Bitcoin to appreciate substantially. A return to previous Bitcoin price peaks would dramatically boost the company's asset value and consequently the stock price. The current collapse of FTX, while creating short-term turmoil, may actually help bitcoin by pushing other unregulated exchanges to be more compliant, enhancing consumer trust and regulatory clarity, potentially accelerating bitcoin adoption. (Source: Company quarterly reports, news, and earnings calls as of Q3 2022.)
* **Increased Adoption of Business Intelligence Software:** Increased demand for business intelligence software, driven by data growth and the need for better decision-making, could positively impact the company's revenue and earnings, leading to a higher valuation. The company is focusing on cloud-based solutions, which is a growing segment of the market. (Source: Company Earnings Calls and Investor Relations)
* **Debt Restructuring:** MicroStrategy has substantial debt related to its Bitcoin purchases. Restructuring this debt at more favorable terms or converting some into equity could improve the company's financial health and reduce the risk of financial distress. MicroStrategy has demonstrated its ability to raise funds through secured and convertible notes.

{: .note }

While a Bitcoin recovery would be a powerful catalyst, the company's heavy reliance on the cryptocurrency creates substantial risk. The strength of the BI software market and potential debt restructuring are positive, but less powerful, catalysts.
 

**Business:**

* **Revenues:**  MicroStrategy's revenue comes from two main sources: product licenses and subscription services. Product licenses typically account for about one-third of revenue, with the rest coming from subscriptions.  Growth has been stagnant or declining in recent years, as the company has struggled to compete with newer cloud-based BI platforms. (Source: Company Filings and Earnings Calls)
* **Industry Trends:**  The business intelligence industry is growing, driven by increasing data volumes and the need for better decision-making.  However, the industry is also becoming more competitive. Cloud-based BI platforms are gaining market share. (Source: Industry reports and market analysis)
* **Margins:**  Gross margins are high (around 80%), but operating margins have been declining due to increased competition and investment in growth initiatives. (Source: Company Filings)
* **Competitive Landscape:**  MicroStrategy faces intense competition from larger, well-established companies like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Tableau, as well as newer entrants in the cloud BI space. (Source: Industry Reports and Market Analysis)
* **Differentiation:** MicroStrategy's platform offers a broad range of features and functionalities.  However, it is unclear whether the company has any significant sustainable competitive advantages over its competitors, beyond switching costs, which are declining in importance. (Source: Company filings and earnings calls as of Q3 2022.)

MicroStrategy is developing a bitcoin lightning network to support its bitcoin strategy. While this has potential, it is still too early to assess its financial impact and viability.
 

**Financials:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has been largely flat in recent years, hovering around $500 million. (Source: Company Filings and SEC Filings)
* **Earnings:**  Earnings have been volatile, impacted by fluctuations in Bitcoin prices and impairment charges. (Source: Company Filings)
* **Debt:**  The company has substantial debt, primarily related to its Bitcoin investments.  This debt is a significant risk factor for the company, especially if Bitcoin prices decline substantially. (Source: Company Filings)
* **Cash Flow:**  Cash flow from operations has been positive, but free cash flow is negative due to the company's significant reinvestments and debt repayments.  (Source: Company Filings)


**Valuation:**

To value MicroStrategy, we will use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model.  Given the uncertainty surrounding the company's future and its heavy reliance on Bitcoin, we will use a range of assumptions and scenarios to estimate the company's intrinsic value.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 0-2% annually for the next 5 years, declining to 0% in perpetuity. (Pessimistic and based on recent historical performance and industry trends)
* **Operating Margin:** 10% (Pessimistic given competitive pressures)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 30% (Based on historical capital expenditures relative to net operating profit after taxes)
* **Cost of Capital:** 12% (Reflecting the higher risk associated with the company's business and Bitcoin holdings)


**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Revenues, Earnings, and Free Cash Flow:**  Project the company's financials for the next 10 years, using the assumptions above.
2. **Terminal Value:**  Estimate the company's terminal value in year 10, using a perpetuity model.
   
   Terminal Value = (FCF in Year 11) / (Cost of Capital - Perpetual growth rate)

3. **Present Value:**  Discount the projected free cash flows and terminal value back to today, using the cost of capital.
4. **Enterprise Value:**  The present value of the free cash flows plus the present value of the terminal value represents the enterprise value.


**Scenarios and Probability Weighting:**

To capture the uncertainty surrounding the company's future, we will consider three scenarios:

* **Base Case:**  The assumptions listed above.  Probability: 50%
* **Upside Case:** Higher revenue growth (3% annually) and higher operating margin (15%).  Probability: 25%
* **Downside Case:** Continued decline in revenue growth (-2% annually) and lower operating margin (5%). Probability: 25%

Calculate the equity value for each scenario and then weight them by their probability to arrive at an expected equity value.

{: .warning }

A significant downside scenario is that MicroStrategy could face a margin call if the price of Bitcoin drops significantly. This risk is difficult to quantify but would lead to a much lower valuation.
 

Based on these calculations, our estimated fair value for MicroStrategy is approximately **$2.3 billion**, which translates into a per-share value significantly lower than the current market price.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Accounting Treatment of Bitcoin:** The company currently marks its Bitcoin holdings to market, creating volatility in its earnings. Changes in accounting standards for digital assets could affect the company's reported financials and valuation.
* **Regulatory Risk:**  The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is evolving and could negatively impact MicroStrategy's business and valuation.


**Conclusion:**

MicroStrategy's valuation is heavily dependent on the price of Bitcoin. While the company's core business intelligence operations may be undervalued, the significant risk associated with its Bitcoin holdings warrants a cautious approach. Given the volatile nature of crypto, the significant debt related to the bitcoin investment, and continued uncertainty around regulation, the company's business and value are difficult to predict with any certainty. Investors would therefore be wiser in seeking out opportunities that have less risk than what seems superficially obvious.
