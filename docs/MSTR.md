{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** MicroStrategy generates revenue primarily through product licenses, subscription services, and consulting.  A significant portion of its revenue stems from product licenses. Revenue distribution has been roughly stable over the last five years, with product licenses remaining the largest source. There has been a shift in business model as more of its software has been packaged as a service; This has lead to changes in accounting rules, specifically around the recognition of revenue. Its 2023 filings state that while the company has improved software sales growth, they have not produced a significant amount of earnings, and so they have made a substantial investment into Bitcoin, leading to a cryptocurrency business segment. 
* **Trends in the Industry:** The enterprise analytics software industry is highly competitive, dominated by large players like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP.  MicroStrategy serves primarily the large enterprise segment. The industry is undergoing consolidation, with larger companies consolidating the market. This makes it difficult for small businesses to survive unless they adopt a cost-leadership position. Recent technological advancements are increasing the spread between industry leaders and smaller businesses because the larger business size enables them to leverage IT, scale, and data more successfully.
* **Margins:** MicroStrategy's margins have declined over the recent years with increased competition.
* **Other Notable Items:** MicroStrategy holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. This adds considerable volatility to the company's value and can make traditional valuations challenging.

**Moat Analysis**

MicroStrategy's narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5 is based on a combination of intangible assets (brand name) and switching costs (for its enterprise customers).

{: .warning }

* **Intangible Assets:** MicroStrategy has a well-known brand name in the business intelligence space, particularly among larger enterprises.  However, this brand recognition is not as powerful as that of the industry giants.  While its brand does create customer loyalty among a subset of customers, it does not translate into strong pricing power.  While a brand is valuable to the degree that it allows for value creation, it is hard to argue that MicroStrategy enjoys anything more than a minor premium as a result of its brand alone. {: .warning }

* **Switching Costs:**  MicroStrategy's enterprise software, being a complex system that integrates deeply into client workflows, does create some switching costs. The transfer of data and retraining required to shift to a competing product can be disruptive and expensive.  However, these switching costs are not as high as in some other software segments, and with the rise of cloud-based solutions and increasing standardization, switching costs are weakening. 
Other potential sources of competitive advantage, such as network effects or cost advantages, are not sufficiently present for MicroStrategy. 

* **Network Effects:**  While some network effects could potentially exist, they are not strong enough to constitute a moat.
* **Cost Advantages:** MicroStrategy does not have any significant cost advantages that would prevent competitors from gaining market share.


**Valuation**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, and considering a significant amount of qualitative uncertainty surrounding the company’s future, I have arrived at a fair value estimate of $2.1 billion for MicroStrategy.


**Assumptions**
Because of the substantial decline in revenue growth from 2022 to 2023, and the company's substantial investment into Bitcoin, it was challenging to build a reasonable model. In the last annual report (2022) they described their business segment as “software products and services” and “bitcoin” so I considered this business as a three-segment company, including “software product licenses”, “software subscriptions and support services”, and “bitcoin”. For simplicity, we used constant ratios for each segment's revenue growth over the next five years. All cash flows are calculated in $ millions.
<br/>

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on 2023 projected revenue, for each segment, I assume the following revenue growth rates over the next 5 years:
-  Product license: 1.0% annual growth.
-  Subscription and Support Service: 3.0% annual growth.
- Bitcoin: 3% annual growth.

* **Margins:**
- Product license: 80% operating margin
- Subscription and Support Service: 20% operating margin
- Bitcoin: 100% operating margin

* **Reinvestment:**
- Product license: reinvestment rate decreasing from 25% to 10%.
- Subscription and Support Service: reinvestment rate decreasing from 25% to 10%.
- Bitcoin: reinvestment rate= 0

* **Tax Rate:** I assume a tax rate of 25%


* **Cost of Capital:** Based on estimated market value of debt and equity, the bond rating of the company, beta, the risk-free rate, and the equity risk premium, as of July 2023, we calculated the cost of capital as 10.4%.
- Beta: 1.7 (Bloomberg average over last 5 years)
- Risk-Free Rate: 3.9%
- Equity Risk Premium: 4.1%
- Marginal Tax Rate: 25%
- Pre-tax cost of debt: 5.6% (based on the yield on the company's BBB corporate bonds)

* **Long-Term Growth Rate:** I assume 3% growth rate for all three segments, in line with the long-run nominal growth rate of the U.S. economy.

* **Terminal Value:**

**Terminal Value Formula**

```
Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 11) * (1 - Reinvestment rate) / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate)
```


**Calculations**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projections:** Project FCF for each segment for the next 10 years. FCF = After-tax operating income * (1 - Reinvestment rate).


2. **Terminal Value:**  Using the formula and inputting values for the stable growth period: Terminal Value = $132.2 million


3. **Present Value of FCF:** Discount each year's FCF and the terminal value back to today at the cost of capital. The sum of the present values is the enterprise value of the operating assets, $2.1 billion.


{: .note }

4. **Nonoperating Assets:** Since MicroStrategy holds substantial amounts of bitcoin, we consider Bitcoin as nonoperating assets, and value them at $1.4 billion based on its most recent valuation (June 30, 2023). 

5. **Debt:** Subtract the market value of debt (long-term and short-term)  ($0.6 billion) from the value of operating assets + nonoperating assets.


6. **Equity Value:** This yields an equity value of approximately $2.1 billion.


{: .important }

 **It is critical to recognize that, because of the number of assumptions used in computing a valuation, the model’s result is only one possible picture of where the company's financials are likely to be in the coming years.**


{: .warning }

This valuation does not take into account the potential for long-term changes in profitability or changes in the price of Bitcoin. The actual stock market value of MicroStrategy will likely deviate from this estimate, reflecting factors such as market sentiment, changes in financial and strategic projections, and unforeseen and unavoidable events.  Given the volatility associated with the company's Bitcoin holdings and the speculative nature of the industry, **this valuation should be viewed with extreme caution.**
