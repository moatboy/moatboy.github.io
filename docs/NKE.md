Pessimistic value: $150 B

Nike's dominant position in the athletic footwear and apparel market is undeniable. However, a moat rating should reflect the *durability and strength* of a company's competitive advantages, not just its current market share. While Nike has benefited from powerful network effects and brand loyalty for decades, I assign a moat rating of 3 out of 5 due to emerging challenges and a more pessimistic outlook for future growth. This rating is based on the framework for evaluating moats presented in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* and the valuation framework from Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels' *Valuation*.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

> This moat rating is lower than what many analysts might assign. My rationale is that there are a number of factors - including intensifying competition, changing consumer preferences, and the possibility of brand impairment - that could erode Nike's moat over the next decade. 


### Management: 3 / 5

I rate Nike's management a 3 out of 5.  While John Donahoe has a strong track record in the technology sector, his tenure at Nike has been marked by both successes (digital transformation, navigating supply chain disruptions) and failures (excess inventory, declining margins in some segments). This mixed bag, combined with concerns about executive compensation and potentially overly optimistic projections, leads to a middling rating. 

{: .note }
>
>  It's important to assess management quality not just on current performance, but also on their long-term vision, capital allocation decisions, and willingness to communicate transparently with investors. As Aswath Damodaran emphasizes in *The Little Book of Valuation*,  the "true test" of management comes when valuing difficult companies, where information is scarce and uncertainty is high.


* **Positives:** Donahoe successfully steered Nike through the pandemic and supply-chain crisis. The company's digital transformation has been a bright spot, with strong growth in online sales. In the Q1 2024 earnings call, Donahoe highlighted the strength of the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy and expressed confidence in the company's long-term digital investments. 
* **Negatives:** Nike has faced criticism for excessive executive compensation (Q1 2024 earnings call and SEC Form 10-K 2023) and insider selling (Form 4 filings).  The company's inventory buildup in 2023 led to margin compression and raised concerns about management's ability to forecast demand accurately (Q4 2023 earnings call).  Furthermore, the company's reliance on a single customer (Foot Locker) for a significant portion of its revenue exposes it to customer-specific risk (2023 Form 10-K).  Finally,  Nike’s performance has been relatively mediocre compared to some of its most successful peers.

### Catalyst: 2 / 5

Nike's catalyst rating is a 2 out of 5. While there are potential growth drivers, like international expansion and product innovation,  I take a more cautious view given the current macroeconomic headwinds and intensifying competition. 

{: .important }
>
> Even during economic downturns, astute investors can find hidden gems, as demonstrated by Burry's investment approach (MSN Money articles 2000/2001). However, a cautious approach is necessary for cyclical or distressed companies.


* **Potential catalysts:** The sportswear industry may experience renewed growth as the global economy recovers. Nike's focus on direct-to-consumer sales could improve margins and reduce its reliance on wholesalers.  Product innovation and brand extensions offer the potential to expand market share.
* **Mitigating factors:**  A global recession could dampen consumer spending on discretionary items like athletic apparel and footwear. Nike faces stiff competition from established players like Adidas and Under Armour as well as emerging brands. The company’s high valuation may limit its upside potential.



### Business and Financial Analysis

* **Revenues:** Nike operates a global business with revenues coming from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Greater China, Asia Pacific and Latin America (2023 Form 10-K).  Wholesale accounts for the largest share of revenues, followed by direct-to-consumer sales.
* **Trends in the Industry:** The athletic apparel and footwear market is highly competitive and driven by trends, fashion, celebrity endorsements, and innovation. Barriers to entry for new brands are significant, but not insurmountable (Dorsey). The industry has experienced consolidation in recent years, and growth in online sales is accelerating.
* **Margins:** Nike's gross margins have declined in recent years due to higher input costs and increased promotional activity (Q1 2024 earnings call).  The company has also experienced pressure on its operating margins.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Nike's primary competitors include Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, and a number of smaller players. Nike has a strong brand image and a large distribution network, but it faces pressure to maintain its premium pricing and fend off competitors’ aggressive moves. Nike also has several significant customers, namely Foot Locker, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Hibbett, Inc. As of fiscal year ended May 31, 2023, Foot Locker generated 14% of the Company's total revenues, while Dick's Sporting Goods and Hibbett, Inc. generated 5% and 1% of total revenues, respectively. 
* **What Makes Nike Different:** Nike's "Just Do It" ethos, celebrity endorsements, and innovative product designs have been key to its success. The company's mastery of branding has created powerful customer loyalty. 


### Valuation: $150 Billion

For the valuation of Nike, I will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, as outlined in Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels’ *Valuation*, because of its global business operations. This method is consistent with the text.  I will take a conservative approach, as the market can be fickle and the future is always uncertain. A two-stage DCF model is typically used in such cases.

**Assumptions:**

1. **Revenue Growth:**  Assume a 5% growth rate in revenues for the next 5 years and 3% terminal growth rate in perpetuity. This reflects slowing growth and intensifying competition.
2. **Operating Margins:** Assume an operating margin of 11% in steady state, which reflects a decrease from current levels due to pressure on pricing and increased promotional activity.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:**  Using the formula from *Valuation*, compute the reinvestment rate using growth in operating income, cost of capital, and return on invested capital (ROIC).
4. **Cost of Capital:** Assume a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7%, based on a cost of equity of 8.5% (using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with a beta of 0.8 based on analysis of its peers), a cost of debt of 4%, and a 10% debt ratio.
5. **Tax Rate:** Assume an effective tax rate of 20%.
6. **Terminal Value:** Compute the terminal value using a perpetuity growth formula as presented in chapter 10 of *Valuation*.

{: .important }
>
> All valuations are biased, and the bias is usually reflected in the direction of the underlying bias in how we view the company or economy (Damodaran). This valuation incorporates a moderately pessimistic outlook given current macro and industry trends and challenges and Nike's pricing model.


**Calculations:**

The detailed calculations will be performed using a spreadsheet model that is too lengthy to be included. It will include pro forma income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, as well as calculations for ROIC, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and present value. For simplicity, assumptions concerning capital expenditures, depreciation, etc. are assumed to be tied directly to revenue growth.

The valuation process will follow these steps:

1. **Historical Analysis:** Analyze historical financial data from Nike's SEC filings, reorganizing and adjusting the financial statements according to the procedures in *Valuation*. 
2. **Forecasting:** Create a pro forma for the next ten years (or 5 for the explicit forecast and then 5 to reach a steady state), incorporating growth, margin, reinvestment rate, and cost of capital assumptions.
3. **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value by dividing the free cash flow in the last year of the explicit forecast period by (WACC - terminal growth rate).
4. **Present Value:** Discount the free cash flows and terminal value back to today using the WACC.
5. **Valuation of Nonoperating Assets:** Value any nonoperating assets (e.g., excess cash, investments) separately.
6. **Enterprise Value:** Sum the present values of operating assets and nonoperating assets.
7. **Equity Value:** Subtract the value of debt and other non-equity claims (e.g., minority interest) from the enterprise value.
8. **Value per Share:** Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.



### Conclusion

Nike is a strong company with a recognizable brand, but it's not without its challenges. Given its high valuation and the uncertain outlook for the global economy, investors should be cautious and not overpay for the stock. A DCF analysis suggests a fair value estimate of approximately \$150 Billion, based on conservative growth assumptions. The key to a successful investment in Nike, as with any company, is to pay attention to the underlying fundamentals, understand what is priced in, and maintain a margin of safety.
