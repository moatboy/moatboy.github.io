Philip Morris International (PM) enjoys a narrow moat based on its strong brands and extensive distribution network, primarily in the heated tobacco unit.  This affords PM pricing power, enabling it to charge a premium for its products.  However, its moat is shrinking due to increasing competition, regulatory headwinds, and the secular decline in smoking rates globally.  These factors are creating headwinds for the company's core combustible cigarette business.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


### The Business

**Revenues Distribution & Trends:** PM's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products, with a growing but smaller contribution from its heated tobacco products. Its geographic revenue distribution is diverse, with significant presence across Europe, East Asia & Australia, South & Southeast Asia, the Middle East & Africa, and the Americas, although each region's contribution is shrinking. This geographic diversity provides some buffer against economic and political risks in individual countries.  The decline in conventional cigarette volumes is a secular trend globally. However, the heated tobacco unit has experienced strong volume growth, albeit from a small base.

**Margins:** Historically, PM has enjoyed robust operating margins, significantly higher than those of most other industries.  However, these margins are under pressure.  Rising input costs, increased marketing spending to promote heated tobacco products, and pricing pressures from discount brands are eroding profits.  These factors are likely to persist in the future.


**Competitive Landscape:** The tobacco industry is highly concentrated, which can create pricing power for dominant firms.  However, the decline in smoking has increased competition as companies scramble for a shrinking customer base.  PM's main competitors in the combustible segment include British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco, Imperial Brands, and Altria.  In the heated tobacco market, competition is increasing as well, primarily from British American Tobacco's *glo* and other alternatives.  The regulatory environment, particularly with regard to plain packaging legislation and advertising restrictions, is putting additional pressure on the competitiveness of incumbent firms.  Finally, private labels are becoming a greater competitive threat.  They offer the same basic product at a much lower cost than name brands.  In the earnings call of the third quarter of 2023, PMI's management stated that they were experiencing some increased intensity in competition on the heated tobacco unit because of new device launches, reduced pricing, and some new regulations.

**What Makes PM Different?:** PMI has a long history of successfully creating innovative products, with innovative technologies and delivery systems.  It is now looking towards heated tobacco units.  It owns several popular brands.  It has a long-standing global presence.  Its size and scale give it cost advantages in many aspects of its operations. Its massive dealer network gives it a significant advantage over competitors, especially during critical periods like planting and harvesting seasons, as it minimizes downtime through quicker repairs.  The company operates in a relatively consolidated industry, though there are new companies entering the market.  It has a relatively concentrated customer base, though they are free to move to its competitors.  As of early 2023, PM has been in the market for decades. Finally, and not surprisingly given their high ROE, PM has generated positive cash flows throughout.

### Financials

PM's financials are sound but are not growing. Revenues, earnings, and cash flow are all essentially flat, reflecting the maturity and declining nature of the industry.  This makes it difficult to justify PM's high valuation based on traditional metrics. 

* **2019 Annual Report:**  Net revenue declined 3.2%, earnings were down 3.5%, and diluted earnings fell 1.4%.
* **2020 Annual Report:**  Net revenues were down by 2.4%, while earnings per share decreased by 3.7%.
* **2021 Annual Report:** Net revenues rose 7.2%.  Earnings before income taxes rose 5.7%, and earnings from continuing operations rose 9.7%, mostly driven by higher sales of smoke-free products.
* **2022 Annual Report:** Net revenues rose 6.7%,  EPS rose 9.3% before currency fluctuations and 0.1% after currency fluctuations,  Cash flows decreased from $10.8B to $10.4B. This decrease can mostly be attributed to reduced investment in inventories. The acquisition of Swedish Match adds another $4.1 billion.
* **2023 Q3 Report:** Net revenues declined 3.1%, operating income decreased 2.2%, and earnings attributable to the firm went down 5.5%.


### Moat Rating Justification

A rating of 3 out of 5 reflects the shrinking but still present moat. While brand strength and distribution remain powerful assets, these are being offset by the declining demand for combustible cigarettes and increasing competition in both conventional and heated tobacco. The regulatory environment continues to get stricter.

### Management Rating Justification

A rating of 2 out of 5 reflects concerns about PM's management. 

* **Capital Allocation:** The acquisition of Swedish Match raises significant questions. There seems to be little strategic coherence between Swedish Match's business model and Philip Morris's core competence.  Furthermore, there is no certainty that PMI will manage Swedish Match profitably. In fact, the track records of acquiring firms suggest the opposite, as explained in Aswath Damodaran's lecture on Mergers and Acquisitions. The acquisition of Vectura for almost double book value in 2021 seems equally nonsensical. In the 2019 annual report, management acknowledged that the Vectura acquisition would not immediately generate profits. The company also continues to buy back its shares at what seems like exorbitant prices.  Finally, there seems to be an over-reliance on acquisitions for growth, rather than focusing on improving existing businesses. 
* **Communication:**  Management tends to make highly optimistic pronouncements about future earnings potential, especially surrounding acquisitions. This raises serious questions about management's credibility and judgment. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears excessive, primarily based on stock options.  According to the company's 2022 annual report, management's stock option compensation represents almost a tenth of earnings. 
* **Insider Ownership:** Management and directors own a negligible fraction of the company's shares, limiting the alignment of their financial interests with those of outside shareholders. In the 2022 annual report, it was revealed that 99% of the shares are not held by the directors of the firm, which validates our assessment.
* **Long-term Focus:** The stock's listing on the NYSE shows that management has a short-term focus on share prices.  According to Warren Buffett's "The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America," the most common characteristic shared by long-term investors is not careing at all about the daily or even monthly movements in the stock's price. Given the high trading volume in Philip Morris' stock, Buffett would conclude that there is a very low percentage of long-term investors among its shareholders. 


### Catalyst Rating Justification

A rating of 2 out of 5 reflects moderate near-term catalysts, which are difficult to achieve in a stable and declining industry. One potential catalyst is the expansion of IQOS into new markets.  Further, cost-cutting could possibly improve margins.  Finally, there is the potential for share repurchases at attractive prices, if PMI's share price falls significantly below intrinsic value.

### Valuation

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model, valuing the firm (not just the equity), was used to estimate PM's intrinsic value.  A DCF values an asset based on the present value of its expected future cash flows. 
{: .note }


The following conservative assumptions were used in the base case:

* **Revenue Growth:** 0% for the next five years, dropping to 0% in perpetuity for cigarettes in line with long-term expectations given secular decline in the industry. 1% for all other lines.
* **Operating Margin:** 45% for next 5 years, then 40% margin in perpetuity.
* **Sales/Capital Ratio:** 1.0, assuming revenue increases and capital expenditures rise roughly in proportion
* **Tax Rate:** 25%, the weighted average of taxes across regions
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 9.0% (using a risk-free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 5%, beta of 0.92 adjusted for financial leverage (beta\_unlevered = 0.69, debt = 43% of firm value, tax rate = 25%), and a before-tax cost of debt of 5.8% for the firm)


**FCFF**

FCFF (Free cash flow to firm) represents the cash flows available to all investors in the firm, including debt and equity holders. Based on our earlier definition in Chapter 3, Free cash flow = Operating income x (1-Tax rate)- Reinvestment

Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) computation:

| Year | EBIT | Tax Rate | After-Tax EBIT | Reinvestment Rate | FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | \$21.3B | 25% | \$16.0B | 2% | \$15.7B |
| 2 | \$21.3B | 25% | \$16.0B | 2% | \$15.7B |
| 3 | \$21.4B | 25% | \$16.0B | 2% | \$15.7B |
| 4 | \$21.4B | 25% | \$16.1B | 2% | \$15.8B |
| 5 | \$21.5B | 25% | \$16.1B | 2% | \$15.8B |

**Terminal Value**

| Variable | Amount |
|---|---|
| Reinvestment rate in stable growth | 2% |
| Return on invested capital | 10% |

Terminal Value = (16.1\*(1+0.01)\*(1-0.02))/(0.09-0.01) = \$203.1B


**Present Value**

| Year | FCFF | Discount Rate | PV |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | \$15.7B | 9% | \$14.4B |
| 2 | \$15.7B | 9% | \$13.2B |
| 3 | \$15.7B | 9% | \$12.1B |
| 4 | \$15.8B | 9% | \$11.1B |
| 5 | \$15.8B | 9% | \$10.1B |
| Terminal | \$203.1B | 9% | \$128.9B |
| **Total Firm Value** |  |  | **\$190 Billion** |

{: .warning }

These calculations and assumptions result in a firm value of approximately \$190 billion.  However, given the uncertainty surrounding the litigation surrounding vaping, uncertainty surrounding regulation in various markets, and uncertainty about the rate and form in which technological changes will continue to transform the industry itself, and uncertainty over the future direction and magnitude of global industry consolidation, there is a possibility that our value estimate here is overly optimistic, especially as it rests on a DCF model.  There is some risk that a 10% cost of capital is too low.  There is also some risk that the margins are too high, perhaps not incorporating sufficiently PM's need to reinvest aggressively to maintain competitive positioning.  There is also some risk that the growth rates are too high, even for such a mature industry, given the long-term economic and competitive forces arrayed against the tobacco industry. There is also considerable risk surrounding the value of the terminal value, given our earlier discussion concerning its often massive size and uncertainty.  There is also the risk of changing assumptions for continuing value calculation.

**Value per Share:**

To arrive at a value per share, we make a few adjustments to the preceding firm value of $190 billion. Note that the financial claims we detail here are as of 31 December 2022, as that is the most recent balance sheet available. The cash balance has not changed much from then to now. However, these numbers are constantly in flux. Further, share repurchases may be more intensive in the future, given the large increase in cash on PMI's balance sheet after Swedish Match. As a rough assessment, the net cash balance may be greater now that the deal has closed and the final balance sheets are available, making our assessment a conservative one. Also, PMI's shares outstanding have changed significantly, with share repurchases outpacing the issuance of new shares in the form of option compensation for management and employees.


* Value of operating assets = \$190 billion.
* Cash and marketable securities (Note 26, 2022 annual report) = \$10.9 billion.
* Minority interests (Note 28, 2022 annual report) =\$1.7 billion
* Debt = \$32.5 billion.
* Value of Equity Options (note 29, 2022 annual report) = \$1.1 billion
* Shares Outstanding (Note 30, 2022 annual report) = approximately 1.24 Billion
* Total Value = \$190.0B + \$10.9B - \$1.7B  - \$32.5B - \$1.1B = \$166.6 billion.


Value per share = $166.6/1.24B = \$134.35 per share

{: .note }

At the end of December 2022, the actual share price was \$95.06. Based on these extremely rough, back-of-the-envelope valuations, we could conclude that the stock was undervalued at that time. By 31 July 2023 the shares closed at \$109.33. As of this writing, PMI's share price is $97.48 per share.
