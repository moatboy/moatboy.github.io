### Business Overview
{: .highlight }

PureCycle's core business revolves around its patented recycling technology that transforms polypropylene (PP) waste into UPR plastic, suitable for high-value applications like consumer goods, food packaging, and automotive parts. 

*   **Revenue Model:** PCT aims to generate revenue by selling UPR plastic produced at its recycling facilities. Its first commercial-scale plant is in Ironton, Ohio with plans to build a second plant in Augusta, Georgia.
*   **Industry Trends:** The global demand for recycled plastics is increasing due to growing environmental awareness and regulatory pressures to reduce plastic waste. However, PP recycling is challenging and has lagged behind PET recycling.
*   **Margins:** PCT projects high EBITDA margins for its UPR product, given the low cost of waste feedstock and the premium pricing of UPR plastic. However, these remain projections, with commercial production still in its nascent stages.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** The PP recycling market is fragmented with existing mechanical recycling methods producing lower-quality recycled PP. PCT claims that its purification process gives it an edge over other companies by producing UPR. However, major chemical companies (e.g., LyondellBasell, Dow) are also investing in advanced recycling, creating direct competition.
*   **What Makes PCT Different:** Proprietary technology, claims on high purification standards and higher grade recycled Polypropylene, environmentally friendly.

### Moat Analysis: (1/5)

PCT currently possesses a very weak moat and has no demonstrated advantage over competitors in the industry. The moat rating is based on the lack of financial stability, and the technology has yet to be proven at scale.
    
*  **Technology:** It is difficult and challenging to replicate with certainty that the technology can scale and be replicated, thus the market has many concerns over it.
*   **Intangible Assets:** PCT's moat hinges primarily on its patented recycling technology. The strength and enforceability of those patents are still not proven, particularly against bigger players. The brand is currently nascent.
*   **Switching Costs:** There is basically no reason to stick with PCT's plastic.
*   **Network effect:** There is no benefit to more customers using PCT, so the moat does not exist.
*   **Cost Advantages:** PCT aims to achieve lower production costs due to using low-cost PP waste as feedstock, but it does not have any edge here so far.


### Legitimate Risks to the Moat and Business

*   **Technological Risk:** PCT relies almost entirely on its technology and needs to prove out the technology and scale the production of their product, this has not happened yet.
*   **Competition:** The competitive landscape has become even tougher, with major chemical firms investing in innovative recycling projects, and they have way more money than PCT.
*   **Operational Risk:** PCT faces significant operational risks in scaling up its recycling facilities and achieving consistent production of UPR plastic and there can be any problems or accidents.
*   **Financial Risk:** If PCT does not improve its financial position it may not be able to continue operation.
*   **Management Risk:** PCT needs to show that is making the right decisions to bring the company to profitability. 

### Financials Analysis

*   **Financial Performance:** The company has extremely poor financial performance, and has had continued consecutive losses. They do not have sufficient cash in hand to cover their losses, thus their rating of 1 out of 5. The auditor firm also expressed substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
*   **Balance Sheet:** The debt to equity ratio as of 2023 is 0.8184 and that has been declining in a bad way since previously it was 1.2672 and 1.9263. They have more liabilities than total assets which is never a good sign.

### Understandability Analysis: (4/5)

*    The recycling business model is fairly easy to understand. However, the core technology and chemistry involved in PureCycle's process are complex and hard to grasp.
*   Key revenue metrics and financial metrics will also be important.
*   Overall, there is a little complexity as the business is very innovative and technologically focussed, however the general idea of the business and the problem that is being solved is not very difficult to understand, thus the business is rated 4/5 in understandability.

### Balance Sheet Health: (1/5)

*   PCT's balance sheet is in a very poor position. The company's assets are outweighed by its liabilities. 
*   Cash flow from operations is negative, with the company burning a lot of cash. 
*   Current capital structure shows high levels of debt.
*   The auditor firm also expressed substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
* Overall, balance sheet health is rated 1/5.

### Recent Concerns/Controversies
{: .important }

*    The audit firm has expressed some doubts about the firm being a going concern in both the 10Q and 10K releases.
*   As for any environmental concerns that have been faced by the company, in the 10Q there are some updates as to what has been decided about certain lawsuits concerning environmental impact.
*   Some of the most recent earnings presentations show lots of losses and are down YoY as well. 

### Business Resilience
*   PCT has not demonstrated business resilience due to being in its beginning phase. Its survival will be dependent on what financial plans come into play.
