{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Nutrien's size and vertical integration within the agricultural inputs industry contribute to its moat.  As the world's largest provider of crop inputs and services, it benefits from economies of scale in procurement, production, and distribution, particularly for potash, where it's the world's largest producer. Its retail network provides a convenient one-stop shop for farmers, further enhancing its competitive position.  However, the industry remains competitive, with new entrants and substitute products limiting pricing power. Furthermore, many of its products are commodities, making it challenging for the company to differentiate itself beyond price. Therefore, a narrow moat rating of 2/5 seems appropriate.

**Management (3/5):**

Nutrien's management team appears generally competent, with a focus on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. They have demonstrated a disciplined approach to capital allocation, generally avoiding large, value-destroying acquisitions. They also communicate clearly with investors, addressing key concerns and providing insights into their strategic thinking.  However, the company's performance has been somewhat uneven in recent years, and there are concerns about its ability to navigate the volatile agricultural inputs market and successfully integrate recent large acquisitions (such as the acquisition of the remaining portion of the Viterra retail business, highlighted in the Q1 2024 earnings call). Also, the compensation for executives is substantial, particularly if we factor in stock options, which can dilute existing shareholders. Therefore, a rating of 3/5 is warranted.  

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for Nutrien include a continued recovery in agricultural commodity prices, driving increased demand for its products. The growing global population and the ongoing need to improve crop yields also support the long-term demand for fertilizers. However, the potash market is cyclical, and supply-demand imbalances can significantly impact pricing. Also, increasing environmental concerns surrounding fertilizer use may pose a threat to future demand. Therefore, a catalyst rating of 2/5 seems reasonable.

**Valuation ($48.9 Billion):**

The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, utilizing the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) approach, which values the entire business rather than only equity. This approach provides flexibility and mitigates potential valuation errors.
{: .highlight }

To enhance clarity and comparability, we adjust financial statements by removing nonoperating assets and costs (e.g., minority interests) as well as other distorting accounting items, such as operating leases.  The methodology is detailed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*.


**Key Assumptions and Calculations:**

{: .note }
* **Forecast Period:** 5 years (2024-2028) followed by a continuing value. A shorter forecast period reduces the sensitivity to assumptions but requires a relatively reliable estimate for continuing value
{: .important }
* **Revenue Growth:** Real GDP growth rate + 0.5%. Real GDP growth rate projection (pessimistic): 2% for North America, 1% for Latin America, 0.5% for Europe and the United Kingdom, 1% for Asia Pacific, and 2% for the Rest of the World. The weighted average real GDP growth forecast is 1.4%. Nominal sales growth = 1.4% (real) + 2.5% (inflation) = 3.9%.
{: .important }
* **Operating Margin:** Gradually rising towards 16.0% by year 10, then declining to 13.0% in perpetuity (industry average), reflecting intensified competition as growth subsides.  (Q1 2024 earnings call stated Nutrien's goal of reaching pretax operating margins of 15-16% in the next 3-5 years).
{: .important }
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Gradually declining in perpetuity to match the stable growth rate. This is estimated as the ratio of net new capital expenditures over NOPLAT. Net capital expenditures = increase in invested capital + depreciation.
{: .important }
* **Tax Rate:** 37.0%, the marginal statutory rate in the United States where Nutrien primarily operates.
{: .important }
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  Calculated using a target capital structure and market-based data. Target Capital Structure: 45% Debt, 55% Equity (Nutrien CFO mentioned maintaining its investment-grade rating of BBB+ in Q1 2024 earnings call and BBB+ rating corresponds to 45% Debt/Enterprise Value). Risk-free rate: 3% (10-year U.S. Government Bond yield as of October 2024). Equity Risk Premium: 5.4% (from Damodaran website, adjusted down for pessimism). Beta: 0.92 (unlevered beta based on peer group of agricultural inputs companies. Levered Beta = 1.3). Cost of Equity: 10.4%. Cost of Debt: 5.5% (based on BBB+ rated bonds).  Weighted Average Cost of Capital: 7.6%.
* **Continuing Value:** Calculated using the constant growth perpetuity model, assuming a terminal growth rate of 2.5% (long-term global inflation rate) and the stable period WACC of 7.0%.  This gives us a continuing value of $49.316 billion as of year 5.

**Valuation Results:**

Discounting the projected free cash flows and the continuing value at the estimated WACC yields an enterprise value of $44.538 billion. Subtracting net debt and other non-equity claims, including minority interests and the estimated value of options, we arrive at an equity value of $30.146 billion, and after factoring in 92.5 million shares outstanding in Q4 2023 (according to company's 10K) we arrive at a value per share of approximately **$32.6**. 
{: .note }

Note that, in line with *The Little Book of Valuation* , we adopt a two-stage approach for valuation, with a detailed explicit forecast over the short-term, followed by a continuing value estimation beyond the forecast period to determine the overall firm value.

**Recent Concerns:**

* **Soft Potash Market:** The potash market is cyclical and highly sensitive to agriculture commodity prices which have come down since their peak. Nutrien has been impacted by lower potash prices, which has led to reduced earnings and free cash flows.  This concern is reflected in our declining revenue growth rates (Q1 2024 earnings call highlights a short-term outlook for soft commodity pricing in the fertilizer market). 
* **Integration of Large Acquisitions:** Successfully integrating large acquisitions, like Viterra,  can be challenging, and any missteps could impact profitability and synergy realization. We have explicitly factored in a substantial investment in capital expenditures and integration costs over the short-term in our model.
* **Geopolitical Instability:** The Russia-Ukraine war has led to increased uncertainty in agricultural markets and increased input costs for fertilizers which makes planning and forecasting a challenge. This has been addressed by calculating our future cashflows in real (rather than nominal) terms and incorporating macroeconomic shocks into scenarios.

**Potential Catalysts:**

{: .highlight }
* **Rebound in Agricultural Commodity Prices:** A significant rebound in crop prices would drive increased demand and pricing for fertilizers, benefiting Nutrien directly.
* **Successful Integration of Acquisitions:**  Successfully integrating recent acquisitions would lead to cost savings and revenue synergies, boosting profitability.


**Overall Assessment:**

Nutrien is a solid company in a vital industry. Its size, integrated operations, and essential products offer a degree of resilience. However, it operates in a competitive and cyclical market, making long-term forecasting challenging. Therefore, it's critical to be sensitive to our valuationâ€™s multiple possible outcomes for the company, especially given the recent softness in commodity prices and uncertainties that come from operating in emerging markets. Consequently, a conservative approach to valuation with a margin of safety is warranted.
