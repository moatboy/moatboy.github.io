ServiceNow operates in a competitive but growing market for IT service management (ITSM). While the company benefits from high switching costs and network effects, these advantages are not absolute and are subject to erosion, justifying a **moat rating of 3 out of 5**.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Management receives a rating of 3 out of 5**, primarily due to concerns about insider ownership, related-party transactions, and long-term strategic focus. The catalyst rating of 2 out of 5 reflects a moderate potential for share price appreciation based on continued growth in the ITSM market and expansion into adjacent areas.

**Business Overview**

ServiceNow's core business is providing cloud-based ITSM solutions. Its platform helps organizations manage IT services, automate workflows, and improve efficiency. 

* **Revenue Distribution:**  The majority of ServiceNow's revenue comes from subscriptions (approximately 90%), which are recognized ratably over the term of the contract.  The remaining revenue is generated by professional services, primarily training and implementation. The company serves a diverse customer base across multiple industries globally (From NOW's 2023 10K).

* **Industry Trends:** The ITSM market is growing rapidly, driven by digital transformation and the increasing complexity of IT infrastructure.  However, competition is intensifying, with established players like IBM and BMC Software, as well as newer entrants.

* **Margins:** ServiceNow's subscription-based model allows for high gross margins (typically above 75%). Operating margins have historically been around 20%.

* **Competitive Landscape:**  The ITSM market is concentrated, with ServiceNow, BMC, and IBM holding the largest market share (From Morgan Stanley Report, October 2024).  Competition is primarily based on product features, ease of use, and pricing.

* **Differentiating Factors:** ServiceNow's key competitive advantages are its platform approach, which allows for easy integration and customization, high switching costs, and a growing network effect (From Dorsey, *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*). The company's Now Platform is the core of its business. It is a single, unified platform that simplifies IT processes, improves workflow, and reduces costs (From NOW's Q4 2023 earnings call). The platform nature of our business has been a key driver of our success (From NOW's Q3 2022 Earnings Call).

{: .warning }

**Recent Concerns:** In recent quarters, there have been concerns about competition from smaller players and pushback on maintenance pricing (From NOW's Q1 2024 earnings call and Morgan Stanley report, October 2024). The increasing complexity of the company's product portfolio also raises questions about its ability to maintain its ease of use and integration advantages. 
{: .warning }

We've also seen new entrants offering very low pricing (From Micheal Burry's journal entry, August 2000). We saw similar issues in the mutual funds during the late 1990s, where everyone tried to beat the market but few succeeded in the long run (From *The Intelligent Investor*, Chapter 9). We saw a similar dynamic with dot-com companies expanding aggressively, but not profitably (From Burry's Journal, April 2001).
{: .warning }

Also, ServiceNow's ITSM offerings are starting to get pushback from clients (From Burry's Journal, April 2001 and NOW's Q3 2023 Earnings Call), something that investors should pay close attention to.

**Management Assessment**

* **History and Experience:** The management team has a mix of long-tenured executives and newer additions, but overall experience is moderate. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is high, with significant stock option grants. This raises questions about alignment with shareholder interests (From Graham's *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, Part I.F). Stock option grants are very high (From NOW's 2023 10K) and although high executive compensation is not a new phenomenon, it seems to be getting worse (From NOW's Q1 2024 Earnings Call).
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, further adding to concerns about management's long-term focus.
* **Communication:**  Management's communication is generally optimistic, even in the face of competitive pressures.  This raises concerns about its willingness to acknowledge potential challenges and adapt its strategy accordingly.
* **Capital Allocation:** ServiceNow has made several acquisitions in recent years. While some have been successful, others have raised questions about the company's strategic direction and its ability to integrate acquired businesses effectively. The acquisition of Element AI seemed like an unusual strategic move, but time will tell (From NOW's Q2 2022 earnings call and Micheal Burry's commentary).

{: .important }

Overall, management's track record is mixed. There are some positives, such as the company's strong growth and innovation. However, concerns about insider ownership, related party transactions (mentioned in several SEC filings), and long-term strategic focus prevent a higher management rating.
{: .important }

Given the competitive landscape for cloud services, acquisitions don't automatically translate to increased profitability (From Burry's journal, March 2001). It is hard to say at this early stage whether management will be good long-term investors (From *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*).


**Financial Analysis**

ServiceNow has delivered strong revenue and earnings growth over the past decade. However, future growth is likely to moderate as the ITSM market matures and competition intensifies.

{: .highlight }

**Valuation:** We use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate ServiceNow's intrinsic value. We value the firm using the Now Platform as a primary driver and apply an assumed 8% growth rate.

**Key Assumptions**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth declining from 20% in 2024 to a stable growth rate of 3% in perpetuity. This pessimistic outlook reflects intensifying competition and the maturation of the ITSM market.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume an operating margin of 25% in the terminal year, up from around 20% currently. This assumes continued operating leverage, but at a lower rate than in the past.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 30% in perpetuity, reflecting continued investment in R&D and sales and marketing.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8%. This estimate is based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4%, a beta of 1.1, a cost of debt of 4%, and a target capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity.

**Calculations**

| Year | Revenue Growth | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | FCFF | WACC | Present Value of FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 20% | $9.1B | 21% | $1.9B | $1.2B | 8% | $1.1B |
| 2 | 15% | $10.5B | 22% | $2.3B | $1.5B | 8% | $1.2B|
| 3 | 10% | $11.6B | 23% | $2.7B | $1.8B | 8% | $1.4B |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Terminal Year | 3% |  | 25% |  |  | 8% | $68.2B |

Total Present Value of FCFF = $89.95B (approximately $90 billion).

**Potential Catalysts**

* **Continued growth in the ITSM market:** The market is expected to grow at a double-digit rate over the next few years, providing a tailwind for ServiceNow.  
* **Expansion into adjacent markets:**  ServiceNow is expanding into areas like customer service management (CSM) and human resources (HR), which could drive further growth. The CSM market in particular could be a big opportunity for the company (From NOW's Q3 2023 Earnings Call). 
* **Increased adoption of the Now Platform:** The Now Platform is a key differentiator for ServiceNow, and its continued adoption could drive further growth. The Now Platform has evolved, and we are seeing early success with our new platform (From NOW's Q2 2022 Earnings Call).

{: .note }

However, these catalysts are not without risks. Competition is intensifying, and ServiceNow will need to continue to innovate to maintain its leadership position. The company's ability to successfully expand into adjacent markets is also uncertain, as is the long-term impact of the shift to cloud-based ITSM solutions.
