Pessimistic value: €120 billion

Sanofi displays some characteristics of a company with a narrow moat, primarily based on its established brand names in the pharmaceutical industry and its global scale. However, a pessimistic view suggests a rating of 3 out of 5. The company's growth rate has been unstable, making a higher moat rating difficult to justify.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

* **Brands:** Sanofi possesses well-known brands in various pharmaceutical markets, which provide some pricing power and customer loyalty. However, the patent cliff remains an ongoing concern, and the company faces significant generic competition for many of its key drugs. This limits the strength and sustainability of its brand-based moat, requiring constant innovation and new drug development to maintain its competitive edge.
* **Scale:** Sanofi benefits from economies of scale, particularly in manufacturing and distribution. Its global reach allows the company to spread costs across a larger revenue base than smaller competitors. However,  scale advantages are becoming less potent due to the globalization of the pharmaceutical industry and the emergence of lower-cost generic manufacturers. Moreover, scale in R&D doesn't necessarily translate into competitive advantage.
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs are minimal for many of Sanofi's products, especially in the generics market. Consequently, doctors and patients can easily switch to competing products with similar efficacy.  This limits the strength of any switching-cost-based moat.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Sanofi's capital allocation decisions have been mixed. While the company has been active in acquisitions and divestitures, not all acquisitions have been strategically sound or value accretive.  For example, the company acquired Principia Biopharma Inc. in 2020, which subsequently had mixed results.  The company has demonstrated a commitment to returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, which is a positive sign, but this alone does not translate into a high management rating.
* **Communication:** Sanofi's communication with investors is generally adequate. The company provides detailed financial information in its annual reports and holds regular earnings calls. However, the company could benefit from providing more insight into its long-term strategy and how it plans to address challenges such as the patent cliff.  Transparency could be improved, particularly concerning performance by business unit. 
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership at Sanofi is minimal. This is not a major concern, given the size of the company, but more insider investment would send a strong signal. (SNY 2020-2F Filing)
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is linked to performance and in line with the industry but also includes a large fixed component. We prefer stronger links to long-run value creation metrics, rather than just hitting short-term targets. (SNY 2020-2F Filing)
* **History/Experience:**  Sanofi's management team has relevant experience but has delivered mixed results over the past few years. As we saw in the previous two chapters, great returns in the past by management (growth rates in the low-double digits) are rarely an indicator of similar returns in the future. (SNY 2020-2F Filing)
* **Long-Term Focus:**  Like many other mature companies, Sanofi's management has shown a tendency to focus on short-term profits. They have provided earnings guidance and adjusted their accounting to make results look better – actions which don't create long-term value. (SNY 2020 Earnings Call Q2)

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Pipeline:** Sanofi's pipeline of new drugs is a potential catalyst for growth, though drug development is inherently risky and timelines for clinical trials and regulatory approvals are uncertain. Successful launch of new drugs could significantly boost revenues and earnings in the long term. (SNY 2023 Earnings Call Q1)
* **Cost Cutting:** The company's ongoing cost-cutting initiatives could boost profitability, although the impact on value creation depends on the degree to which these savings translate into higher revenues or cash flows, rather than just offsetting declines.  (SNY 2023 Earnings Call Q2)
* **Emerging Markets:**  Sanofi has a significant presence in emerging markets, which could be a source of long-term growth, although these markets also carry substantial risks. (SNY 2023 Earnings Call Q2)

**Valuation (€120 billion):**

We will use a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model to estimate Sanofi's value.  As highlighted in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, DCF models remain superior in principle because they rely on sound cash flows rather than manipulatable earnings.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth of 3% annually for the next 10 years, reflecting a modest but realistic outlook given current market dynamics and industry growth rates.  We acknowledge the risk of technological change, regulatory restrictions and customer churn and assume a decline in gross bookings after 2023. (SNY 2023 Earnings Call Q2)
* **Operating Margin:**  We project a gradual improvement in Sanofi's operating margin, eventually stabilizing at 25% of revenues. This is slightly below the company's current margin but reflects a pessimistic outlook for margin expansion in the face of generic competition. (SNY 2023 Earnings Call Q2)
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We assume a reinvestment rate (capital expenditures/depreciation + change in non-cash working capital relative to revenue) of 30% of after-tax operating income for the first five years and 10% thereafter. This represents a combination of investments in R&D and ongoing expenditures required to support new product launches as well as sustain growth for existing products. The decline reflects maturation of several of Sanofi's newer products with the increasing importance of cost-cutting, given the pressure on profitability as mentioned during the Q3 2021 Earnings Call.
* **Cost of Capital:**  We estimate Sanofi's cost of equity to be 9%, based upon a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5%, and a beta of 0.92. The cost of debt is estimated at 4.2%, reflecting current market yields on corporate bonds with similar ratings. We use a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity, which results in a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%. We use current yields on 10-year government bonds and use a risk-free rate of 4.09% based on implied yields from forward rates for years beyond maturity provided in the SNY 2023-20F. (SNY 2023-20F)
* **Terminal Value:** We estimate the terminal value using a perpetuity model, assuming a stable growth rate of 2% and a cost of capital of 9%, which produces a present value of continuing value (after year 10) of approximately €89 billion. This growth rate is in line with long-term global economic forecasts, and the cost of capital is intentionally high to provide for an additional margin of safety, given the long-term uncertainty surrounding the pharmaceutical industry. 

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation:**
   We project FCF for the next 10 years using the following formula: FCF = After-tax Operating Income x (1 - Reinvestment Rate).  Precise calculations are shown in Table 9.3 for Kraft Heinz but for Sanofi would be similar in calculation approach and numbers would be different based on the assumptions.  (SNY 2019-20F Filing, SNY 2020-20F, SNY 2021-20F, SNY 2022-20F, SNY 2023-20F)

2. **Present Value of FCF:**
   We discount the projected FCFs back to the present using a WACC of 7.56%, shown in table 9.4 but for Sanofi would be similar.


3. **Enterprise Value:**
   We sum the present value of FCFs and the present value of the terminal value to arrive at an enterprise value of approximately €120 billion.

4. **Equity Value:**
   We subtract the market value of debt and other non-equity claims from enterprise value to obtain equity value.  Based on Sanofi's recent financial filings, we estimate total debt outstanding at around €22 billion and assume other claims of €10 billion resulting in an Equity Value of €88 billion. (SNY 2023-20F)


**Addressing Recent Concerns:**

Sanofi has faced several headwinds in recent years, including:

* **Dupixent Patent Litigation:**  Sanofi recently announced that a U.S. District Court had ruled against the company in the patent litigation case surrounding its blockbuster drug Dupixent. This ruling could potentially lead to the loss of exclusivity for Dupixent before its patent expires in the 2030s, opening the door to biosimilar competitors. We did factor this into the valuation, but with uncertainty around the degree to which this ruling will impact revenues, we have increased our discount rate to reflect increased risk as we did with Bed Bath and Beyond and as inspired by Micheal Burry's writings. (SNY 2023 Earnings Call Q2)
* **Declining Sales of Established Drugs:**  Sales of some of Sanofi's established drugs, such as Lantus and Toujeo (insulin products) are declining due to generic competition. As these drugs lose patent protection, there is an urgent need to introduce new drugs to compensate for the revenue loss. This is a critical concern reflected in our modest revenue growth assumption. (SNY 2022 Earnings Call Q3)
* **Pricing Pressure:**  Sanofi is facing pricing pressure, particularly in the United States, as mentioned during the Q2 2021 Earnings Call. Governments and other payers are increasingly focused on cost containment. This has been factored into the margin estimates with a pessimistic view.
* **Revlimid Patent Expiry:** Revlimid sales are declining with the recent patent expiry, impacting near-term sales growth. (SNY 2023 Earnings Call Q1)

{: .note }

It is worth noting that any single-point estimate of value should be treated with caution. Given the uncertainty associated with drug development, drug pricing, and the evolution of the pharmaceutical industry, there is a significant probability that Sanofi’s value may be substantially different from €120 billion. I recommend constructing a range of values, using multiple scenarios, to determine whether you are getting a good deal on your investment, especially when you are investing in a firm with substantial uncertainty and a single source of value creation.
