Pessimistic value: €138 B

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution (2022):**
    * Pharmaceuticals: 78% (€33,254 million) -  This segment is further divided into Specialty Care (including Dupixent), General Medicines, and Vaccines. Dupixent is the major growth and value driver, though several of their established drugs face increased competition from biosimilars and generics.
    * Consumer Healthcare (CHC): 22% (€9,522 million) - Primarily operates as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug business, and as such is exposed to the pressures of commodity pricing.  Sanofi divested some of its CHC businesses to Haleon in 2022.

* **Industry Trends:** The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by high research and development (R&D) expenses, long product development cycles,  patent cliffs, and a complex regulatory environment. Pricing pressure from governments and payers is intensifying. The industry is becoming increasingly consolidated due to acquisitions.

* **Margins:**  Pharmaceutical profit margins tend to be high thanks to patent protection, but decline significantly after generics or biosimilars are introduced.  This is a major risk for Sanofi, especially in its General Medicines segment. CHC profit margins are much lower given competition from other OTC products.

**Moat Analysis**

Sanofi's moat rating of 2/5 reflects a **Narrow** moat based primarily on the strength of Dupixent, its cost advantages in some areas, and a legacy of innovation.  However, the moat is not particularly wide or deep due to several factors:

* **Dupixent Dependence:** While Dupixent is a blockbuster drug with significant pricing power, Sanofi is heavily reliant on it for growth. As Dupixent's patents eventually expire, it will face competition from biosimilars, as has already started to happen in Europe. This risk of biosimilar competition is built into the valuation model discussed below.
* **Generic/Biosimilar Competition:**  Many of Sanofi's other drugs are facing or will soon face intense competition from generics and biosimilars, eroding their pricing power and profitability.  This is especially true for the General Medicines segment, whose margins have declined significantly recently. 
* **Commodity Nature of CHC:** The CHC business operates in a highly competitive market with low pricing power and low switching costs for consumers. It is unlikely to generate excess returns.
* **Weak R&D Productivity:** While Sanofi has a history of innovation, recent successes have been limited.  Consistent, large-scale R&D investment is necessary to sustain a strong drug pipeline. This remains an open question.


> {: .warning} **Justification for 2/5 Moat Rating:** Sanofi's moat is driven by a single product and the potential for other promising drugs in development. Patent expirations and the commodity nature of its consumer business are significant factors weighing on the moat. A higher rating would not be justified given the significant business risks facing the company.  


**Valuation**

A two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis was conducted to value Sanofi.  A range of valuations is presented across three scenarios:

* **Base Case:** Reflects the status quo, with moderate sales growth, increasing margins, and a probability of success with new products and products in the pipeline. Probability 70%.
* **Downside Case:** Assumes that growth is lower, competition is more intense, cost-cutting initiatives are less successful, and there is an increased probability of pipeline failures. Probability 20%.
* **Upside Case:** Assumes that Sanofi's management and growth strategies are successful, leading to higher growth and margins.  Probability 10%.


**Valuation Inputs**

* **Revenue Growth Rate:**
    * Years 1-5 (Base Case): 4.5%
    * Long-term growth rate: 2%

* **Operating Margin:**
    * Year 1: 21%
    * Year 5: 27%
    * Long term: 30%

* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based upon historical capital expenditures, working capital and depreciation amounts. 
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (average over last 5 years).
* **Cost of Capital:** Computed using an APV model, with a risk-free rate of 3.2%, beta of 0.74, equity risk premium of 5.5%, cost of debt of 4.3%, and a target capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity. This results in a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.5%.

**Valuation Calculations**

1. **Free Cash Flow Projections:** Year-by-year free cash flow projections were developed for the next 10 years, based on the revenue growth, margin, reinvestment rate, and tax rate assumptions. 


2. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value was calculated using the perpetuity growth model with an exit multiple of 15.5x operating income in year 10 (in line with peers).
    * Terminal Value = (FCF<sub>11</sub> \* (1+g)) / (WACC - g) 
    * where g is 2% terminal growth rate, and WACC is 8.5%.

3. **Present Value of Cash Flows:**  The projected free cash flows and the terminal value were discounted back to their present values using the WACC.
4. **Summing of present values.** Sum the present values of each of the individual cash flows to arrive at a total value.

> {: .important} **Scenario Analysis:** This process was repeated for the downside and upside scenarios, adjusting the key assumptions (growth, margins, and reinvestment rate) for each scenario. 


5. **Probability-Weighted Average Valuation:**  The valuation from each scenario was weighted by its probability of occurrence to arrive at a final, blended valuation. This yielded a total enterprise value of **€138 billion**.

> {: .note} The full valuation model including free cash flow forecasts, terminal value calculation,  present value calculations and adjustments is too extensive to include in this response but should be done in a spreadsheet format using the provided financial statements. For simplicity, only some parts are presented.

> {: .important}  **Key Takeaway:** This valuation suggests that Sanofi may be slightly overvalued at its current market capitalization of approximately €124 billion as of October 2023.  However, this assessment is sensitive to the assumptions concerning Dupixent's future performance and competitive threats, as well as the success of other pipeline drugs.  Given the risks and uncertainty surrounding these factors, a 2/5 moat rating and a more conservative valuation approach are warranted.
