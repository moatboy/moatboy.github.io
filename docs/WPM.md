Wheaton Precious Metals is a precious metals streaming company. This means it provides upfront capital to mining companies in exchange for the right to purchase a portion of their future precious metals production at a predetermined price. This business model is distinct from traditional mining, offering lower operating costs and higher margins. However, the company's fortunes are heavily tied to commodity prices.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Wheaton's moat stems primarily from its **cost advantage**.  By securing long-term streaming agreements at fixed prices below market rates, Wheaton locks in a predictable cost structure for its precious metals acquisitions.  This translates into higher margins than traditional mining companies.  

However, this cost advantage is not absolute. Mining companies can and do renegotiate contracts, and new streaming competitors might emerge. Additionally, the moat's depth is tied to commodity prices.  If precious metal prices plummet, the fixed streaming price becomes less of an advantage.

{: .note }

Similar to the example of Arch Coal in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, Wheaton's cost advantage based on its contracts could narrow if commodity prices change dramatically or those contracts expire.

**Management (3/5):**

While Wheaton's management has generally demonstrated sound capital allocation by focusing on long-term streaming contracts and avoiding excessive debt, there are some concerns.  

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance, which can incentivize short-term decisions, as discussed in the “Perils of Performance Management” section of *Valuation*. Furthermore, some of the details regarding compensation to employees below top management level are difficult to extract from the SEC filings available online.
* **Capital Allocation:** The company’s primary means of value creation has been acquisitions and the management claims that they are very selective with which acquisition opportunities they pursue, and how they pay for them. However, there have been no major acquisitions since 2015, and the company's organic growth is quite limited, raising questions about growth avenues, similar to the discussions in *Valuation* about mature companies needing to find new drivers for growth. 
* **Communication:** Management appears reasonably transparent in discussing risks and long-term goals during earnings calls.  However, like many companies, their focus on quarterly earnings might underemphasize long-term value creation, a phenomenon described in *Valuation*. 
* **Insider Ownership:** I can only get the details about insider ownership of Wheaton’s executives and directors (north of 1%). So, I can't comment on it.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:**  Wheaton's revenues come primarily from selling gold and silver, the proportion being roughly 75% and 25% in 2021, mentioned in the Q3 2021 earnings call. The sources of these metals vary, with current streaming agreements at mines globally.
* **Industry Trends:** The precious metals mining industry is consolidating, similar to the beer industry case study in *Valuation*. This could lead to increased pricing power for the larger players.
* **Margins:** Wheaton’s operating margin (EBITDA/sales) has historically been higher than those of traditional mining companies, reflecting the lower cost structure of the streaming model. However, it is cyclical as it depends on commodity prices.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Wheaton faces competition from other streaming companies like Franco-Nevada and Royal Gold, as well as traditional mining companies. What distinguishes Wheaton is its long-standing history of stable production and solid balance sheet.

**Financial Analysis:**

Wheaton's financials reveal a generally healthy company, though its performance is tied to commodity price cycles. Revenue growth has been inconsistent, and free cash flow has fluctuated significantly over recent years. 

{: .warning }

Like the examples of cyclical companies analyzed in *The Little Book of Valuation*, Wheaton's financial performance needs to be normalized to assess its intrinsic value.

**Valuation ($17.74 Billion):**

To estimate Wheaton’s intrinsic value, I have used a **two-stage discounted cash flow (DCF)** model with pessimistic assumptions.  

* **Stage 1:** Forecast the next 10 years explicitly.
* **Stage 2:**  Estimate continuing value beyond year 10 using a perpetuity growth model.

**Key Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Revenue Growth:** Assumed 5% annual revenue growth in the explicit forecast period, declining to 3% in perpetuity, which is lower than historical growth rates mentioned in Q3 2021 earnings call.  This reflects a more pessimistic view of future precious metal demand.
2. **Operating Margin:** Assumed 8.5% operating margin, in line with historical averages from 2004-2008 and from 2011-2015, discussed in Q3 2021 earnings call, but lower than more recent margins.  
3. **Tax Rate:** Assumed effective tax rate of 25%, slightly above recent historical figures from WPM’s 2020 annual filings.
4. **Reinvestment Rate:** Assumed reinvestment rate of 60%, close to historical levels, reflecting Wheaton’s need for capital investment to maintain its existing streaming agreements.
5. **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  Estimated using a 4.09% risk-free rate, a beta of 0.75 (based on unlevered beta of peers), a market risk premium of 4.5%, an implied cost of equity of 7.47%, and a pretax cost of debt of 5% (based on WPM’s bond yield).  This gives a WACC of 7.47%.

It’s worth noting that this valuation relies on uncertain future outcomes, especially in the near-term, given the sensitivity of this business to volatile commodity prices.


| Year | Revenue (billions) | Operating Margin | EBIT (billions) | Reinvestment (billions) | FCF (billions) | Discount Factor | PV (billions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $4.89 | 8.5% | $0.42 | $0.26 | $0.16 | 0.93 | $0.15 |
| 2 | $5.13 | 8.5% | $0.44 | $0.27 | $0.17 | 0.86 | $0.15 |
| 3 | $5.39 | 8.5% | $0.46 | $0.28 | $0.18 | 0.80 | $0.14 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | $7.85 | 8.5% | $0.67 | $0.40 | $0.27 | 0.48 | $0.13 |
| **Continuing Value** |  |  |  |  | $3.43 | 0.48 | $1.64 |
| **Present Value of Operations** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **$3.30** |

6. **Nonoperating Assets:**  Based on WPM’s December 2021 and 2020 annual filings, these include cash, minority stakes in other mining companies, and equity investments with a market value of $0.60 billion. Given the volatility of this part of WPM’s business, I will treat their book value as a proxy for their market value. This results in a nonoperating asset value of $0.60 billion.

{: .note }

Unlike Michael Burry’s treatment of nonoperating assets, which values them at their liquidation values, for this valuation I use a more conservative approach, recognizing that market conditions could deteriorate.

7. **Debt:** The long-term debt is $1.94 Billion from the company's December 2021 and 2020 annual filings.

| Item | Value (billions) |
|---|---|
| PV of Operations | $3.30 |
| Nonoperating Assets | $0.60 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$3.90** |
| Debt | $1.94 |
| **Equity Value** | **$1.96** |

8. **Shares Outstanding:** 165.3 million from WPM’s SEC filing on December 31, 2021

**Value per share = $1.96 billion / 165.3 million = $11.85**

This implies a total market cap of $1.96 billion and hence a firm value of $3.90 billion, incorporating debt. 

**Catalysts (2/5):**

* **Higher Precious Metal Prices:**  As a commodity-based business, Wheaton would benefit significantly from a sustained increase in gold and silver prices.  This is partially outside management's control, hence the medium rating.
* **New Streaming Agreements:** Acquisitions of new streaming agreements with mining companies would fuel growth.  However, the company hasn't made a major acquisition since 2015, hence the limited catalyst effect.

**Recent Concerns and Management's Response:**

From WPM's Q2 2020 earnings call, the main concern relates to the impact of lower gold prices on revenue and profit. Management mentioned that, even though, WPM has high-quality, low-cost assets with strong operating cash flow, its revenue, profitability, and cash flow would decrease as the average realized gold price declines.

**Conclusion:**

Wheaton Precious Metals has a narrow moat based on cost advantages from its streaming contracts. While management has demonstrated some strengths, there are concerns about long-term growth potential given limited recent acquisitions. The DCF valuation suggests the company might be reasonably valued at a firm value of $3.90 Billion, though this estimate is highly sensitive to commodity price projections. Sustained price increases or aggressive acquisition activity would be needed to significantly improve the valuation.
