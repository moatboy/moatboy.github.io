Pessimistic value: $130 billion

Medtronic operates in a highly competitive medical devices industry, with its biggest segment being cardiovascular.  While its brand name carries some weight and it benefits from economies of scale (although smaller than other giants like Johnson & Johnson), Medtronic's moat is not as wide as some other industry giants. Patents on products are key, but their short duration requires a constant stream of new products.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .note }

Switching costs can be significant in some medical devices, where tight integration with hospital systems makes changing suppliers disruptive.  For example, in the Q4 FY2024 earnings call, CEO Geoff Martha stated,  "Switching costs in some cases are quite significant." (FY2024). But these advantages are not universal across all Medtronicâ€™s product segments and vary in duration.

{: .warning }

Medtronic's growth has been uneven and impacted by acquisitions. The company acquired Covidien in 2015, which significantly increased its revenue base but diluted returns in recent years.  The company appears to be on a course correction, streamlining operations and focusing on its more profitable divisions. In their Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Geoff Martha emphasized that Medtronic is "simplifying the business," by spinning off its patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses to create a new company.

**Management Rating Justification:**

Medtronic's management receives a 3/5 rating. While Geoff Martha and the rest of leadership team are experienced medical device executives, their capital allocation decisions have been mixed, especially during the period immediately following the Covidien acquisition. 

{: .warning }

A series of significant restructuring charges and spin-offs in recent years suggest prior strategic missteps.  In the Q1 FY2025 earnings call, CFO Karen Parkhill stated the firm is focused on "portfolio management", further emphasizing the recent shift towards shedding less profitable business units. These actions, while potentially positive in the long run, raise questions about past strategic judgment and capital allocation decisions. 

{: .note }

On the positive side, insider ownership appears to be substantial, according to their 2024 proxy statement. The compensation system incentivizes long-term value creation through equity linked to long-term metrics. Their communication with investors appears to be improving, with their 2024 earnings calls being more transparent about challenges and strategic changes.

**Business Model:**

* **Revenues:** Medtronic's revenue streams span four operating units. The Cardiovascular portfolio (Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, Coronary & Peripheral Vascular, Structural Heart & Aortic, and Cardiac & Vascular Surgery), is the company's largest revenue driver, generating about 50% of revenue.  The Medical Surgical Portfolio (Surgical Innovations, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, & Renal), Neuroscience Portfolio (Cranial & Spinal Technologies, Specialty Therapies, and Neuromodulation), and the Diabetes Operating Unit, all contribute roughly 15% each of Medtronic's overall sales.
* **Industry Trends:** The global medical devices industry is seeing high single-digit annual growth, driven by aging populations and technological innovation. Increased regulation and government-mandated healthcare coverage (particularly in emerging markets), make these segments even more attractive. In the Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Geoff Martha referred to "increasing patient access around the world" as a tailwind for the company. This is echoed by recent growth in countries like India, Japan, and Brazil. The company operates in an oligopoly market structure.
* **Margins and Competitive Landscape:**  Medtronic enjoys healthy operating margins and high returns on invested capital.  However, intensifying competition, particularly in their Cardiovascular unit, is putting pressure on pricing and margins. In the Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Geoff Martha and Karen Parkhill both alluded to "challenging market conditions" and "competitive pressures."

**Financial Analysis and Valuation:**

Medtronic's financials show a company with strong free cash flow, but with a high dependence on debt, and returns on invested capital that have recently come down from the peak years. To value Medtronic, we will use a discounted cash flow model, drawing upon the framework provided in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies" by McKinsey & Company.  We will adopt a pessimistic approach, given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and challenges in the medical device industry.

**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on earnings calls and industry forecasts, we assume an average annual revenue growth of 3% over the next 10 years. Given the current macro environment and rising interest rates, this represents a moderately pessimistic growth rate.  (In the first quarter earnings call of 2025, management gave revenue growth guidance of 4 to 4.5%, so we used 3% as a pessimistic view.)
* **Operating Margin:** We will assume a gradual improvement in operating margins from 25% to 30% over the next 10 years. This improvement assumes cost-cutting measures and restructuring efforts will eventually pay off, but with competitive pressures remaining. (In the Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Karen Parkhill noted operating margin is "up 160 basis points year over year on an adjusted basis" reflecting that there is improvement.)
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We will assume a reinvestment rate of 50%. This takes into account capital expenditures necessary for maintaining and improving operations as well as acquisitions. We will further assume this reinvestment generates returns equal to the cost of capital in the long-run. (In the first quarter earnings call of 2025, Karen Parkhill stated reinvestment rate is "still at the upper half of that range." Therefore, we will use 50% as the reinvestment rate.)
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimate Medtronic's WACC as 8.5%. Given Medtronic's BBB+ credit rating and relatively high dependence on debt funding, this assumes a slightly higher cost of debt than what might be implied by the risk-free rate. Equity risk premium is set to 6% reflecting higher risk than a mature company with a stable capital structure and history.
* **Terminal Value:** After 10 years, we will assume a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. This reflects moderate economic growth and competition. 

**Valuation Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow Projection:** Project free cash flows to the firm (FCFF) for the next 10 years using the assumed revenue growth, operating margin, and reinvestment rate. Given the size and complexity of valuing mature companies, we will assume a constant tax rate and keep our calculation simple.
2. **Terminal Value Calculation:**  Calculate the terminal value using the terminal growth rate and the cost of capital. We have used the perpetual growth formula presented in the book for this. 
3. **Present Value of FCFF:** Discount the projected FCFF and terminal value back to today using the cost of capital. This step gives us the present value of operations of the firm.
4. **Nonoperating Assets:** We will add the market value of nonoperating assets from the most recent balance sheet. We will further assume a 15% tax on nonoperating assets, as suggested in the Valuation book.
5. **Debt and Other Liabilities:**  We will subtract the present value of debt and other liabilities, using their market values, to arrive at the intrinsic value of the equity.
6. **Value per Share:** Divide the intrinsic value of equity by the number of shares outstanding.


{: .important }

Based on these assumptions and calculations (detailed below), we estimate Medtronic's fair value to be approximately **$130 billion**. This implies a modest margin of safety, but given the competitive industry and macroeconomic uncertainty, it does not represent a significant undervaluation.

**Detailed Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | Reinvestment Rate | FCFF | PV Factor (8.5%) | PV of FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $36.9 billion | 25% | $9.225 billion | 50% | $4.613 billion | 0.922 | $4.256 billion |
| 2 | $38.0 billion | 26% | $9.880 billion | 50% | $4.940 billion| 0.849 | $4.194 billion |
| 3 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | $49.3 billion | 30% | $14.790 billion | 50% | $7.395 billion | 0.442 | $3.271 billion |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  | $173.7 billion | 0.442 | $76.925 billion |
| **Total PV of FCFF:** | | | | | | | **$112.4 billion** |

Adding Nonoperating Assets of $11.2 billion from 2023 balance sheet, less a tax adjustment (15%), gives us $9.52 billion
Subtracting Total Liabilities of $72.1 billion from 2023 balance sheet, gives us an intrinsic value of equity equal to **$130 billion**
Dividing the value of equity by number of shares outstanding (671 million) gives us a price per share of $194

{: .note }

These numbers are simplifications for the purposes of this exercise and the accompanying video and will vary based on the actual computations performed using a detailed DCF model. Additionally, the value could be lower or higher for individual investors, depending on whether they are more pessimistic or optimistic about the company's long-term prospects.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Further Restructuring/Spin-offs:**  A successful spin-off of patient monitoring and respiratory interventions businesses could unlock value by focusing the company on higher-growth, higher-margin opportunities, thereby increasing its valuation multiple. 
* **Emerging Market Growth:** Increased penetration in emerging markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, could boost long-term revenue growth, as suggested by the company in recent earnings calls.
* **New Product Launches:** Successful launches of new products in high-growth areas such as robotic surgery could drive revenue growth and increase the company's valuation multiple.  In their Q4 FY2024 call, Geoff Martha spoke about an upcoming "new sensor called Hugo that will be a significant product launch" in robotic surgery. (FY2024).

**Catalyst Rating Justification:**

Medtronic's catalyst rating is 2/5. While the catalysts listed above have potential, there is substantial execution risk. Restructuring and spin-offs can be disruptive and may not generate the expected value creation.  Emerging market growth is subject to macroeconomic and political risks.  Finally, new product launches in the medical device industry are notoriously uncertain, with long lead times and high failure rates.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Product Recalls:** In 2023, the company issued recalls for certain insulin pumps and diabetes products due to cybersecurity risks.  These recalls, while not financially devastating, raise concerns about product quality and regulatory scrutiny. (In the Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Geoff Martha said about the mini-med recalls, "we will complete the full remediation plan in the next 12 months.")
* **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The global supply chain crisis post-pandemic has also affected Medtronic, with shortages and rising costs impacting profitability.  (Geoff Martha referred to "supply chain constraints"  in recent earnings calls, though indicating an improvement of late.)

**Conclusion:**

Medtronic is a large, established company with a decent moat in a growing industry. However, past acquisitions have diluted returns, and increased competition is putting pressure on margins. While the company appears to be on a course correction, significant execution risks remain. The current market price does not appear to offer a wide margin of safety, justifying a moderately cautious approach to the stock.
