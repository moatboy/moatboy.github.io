Pessimistic value: $52.8 billion

Ingersoll Rand operates in a competitive landscape, manufacturing and providing diverse industrial products and services. While certain product lines exhibit some pricing power, the overall business lacks a durable moat.  This limited moat is primarily derived from its brand name, customer relationships, and some switching costs in specific product categories.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

* **Brand Name:** IR has a decent brand name in the Industrial Technologies and Services segment, but brand recognition is not a sufficient moat on its own. This is because brand name does not always translate into pricing power, especially in industrial sectors. Many businesses have very big recognizable names, yet do not have profitable brands. Examples include Ford, General Motors, and Sony as discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth".  Many of the industrial products sold by IR face competition from generic or private-label alternatives, limiting pricing power.
* **Customer Relationships/Switching Costs:**  IR benefits from customer stickiness in certain product lines, such as those requiring specialized servicing.  A strong dealer network, as discussed in one of the sample articles by Micheal Burry, can create customer stickiness. There are meaningful switching costs for customers who have embedded the company's software and systems into their operations, such as its compressed air systems.  However, switching costs are not universal across all of IR's offerings. Many products are commoditized, where price is the primary driver.  Furthermore, competition can erode switching costs by offering easier integration or lower service costs.
* **Scale:**  Although IR is a large player in some markets, scale advantages are largely regional or even local in several of its businesses such as the aggregates and HVAC distribution networks.  Global economies of scale are not apparent for the entire company.  For its Industrial Technologies and Services business, in the aggregates and HVAC distribution network, large established companies have been facing serious competition from smaller firms in their own backyards, for example, the aggregates business in Central Texas as presented in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth". In today's economy, with cheaper labor and capital, new competitors with smaller business models like Breeze Airways or JetBlue have shown up and posed a significant challenge for the larger companies in their respective industries, for example, airlines. Therefore, although scale could provide some cost advantages in manufacturing businesses, it is not substantial enough to warrant a high moat rating for the entire company.
* **Lack of Network Effects/Intangible Assets:** The company's business model does not benefit from network effects, and intangible assets (patents, licenses, etc.) play a small role.


**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** The capital allocation history reveals a mixed track record.  The company engages in acquisitions and divestitures, but the financial success of these acquisitions, as discussed in detail in the "Valuation" book, can vary considerably by industry, by size of acquirer, and by acquirer’s strategic position before the acquisition. Given that the company's management is prioritizing acquisitions as a source of growth (discussed in their 2020 earnings call) to leverage upon its sales force and its brand reputation, there is no evidence that management has an edge to make better acquisition decisions over a long period. The sale of its Club Car business, though profitable, may indicate a missed opportunity to nurture and further build upon an established brand in a growing market segment. The acquisition of Thermo King in 1997 caused Ingersoll Rand’s shares to decline as revealed in the text "The Intelligent Investor".
* **Communication:** Management communication is generally adequate, providing financial information and discussing strategic initiatives.  However, there's a lack of deep dives into segment-level performance and drivers, making it difficult for investors to fully assess the strength and sustainability of each business unit.  The company does not explain the methodology it uses to allocate costs among divisions.
* **Insider Ownership/Compensation:** Insider ownership is modest. Executive compensation is tied to performance but carries a substantial equity component as revealed in their 2021 Annual Report, which can incentivize short-term decision-making.  Stock option grants, as discussed in "The Essays of Warren Buffet", although potentially valuable, need careful assessment given the incentive they create for management to mislead investors, especially when stock valuations are at or above intrinsic value and management has an interest in showing a profit and keeping its job.
* **Long-Term Focus:**  While the company emphasizes long-term value creation, the relative short tenure of several key executives raises concerns about the consistency and depth of this focus.
* **Overall:** The management team appears competent, but there is no evidence of exceptional capital allocation skill or truly owner-minded behavior.  The modest insider ownership and equity-heavy compensation warrant skepticism and a conservative rating.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Market Share Growth:**  IR is pursuing growth in emerging markets and newer product categories. Successful execution of this strategy could drive higher revenue growth and improve margins.  However, given the competitive nature of these markets, growth is uncertain.
* **Margin Expansion:**  IR has been focusing on improving profitability through cost-cutting and pricing initiatives.  However, realizing these margin improvements is subject to market dynamics and competitive pressures. 
* **Acquisitions:**  Management has also highlighted acquisitions as a key element of its growth strategy. However, the success of acquisitions in creating value is not a given.
* **Overall:** The company does face some industry headwinds, like the semiconductor industry downturn, which may hinder or slow growth in certain of its segments, as mentioned in their third quarter 2023 earnings call. There are no clearly identifiable catalysts with a high probability of materially impacting the share price in the near term.  Thus, the catalyst rating is low.



**Valuation ($52.8 billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation is used to estimate the company's intrinsic value. Due to cyclicality, a regression of ROIC against revenues over the preceding 10 years ($3.5295B * 1.17 * 23 years) is used to estimate IR's ROIC for the next few years and their ability to sustain their ROICs. A two-stage variation DCF valuation model approach is employed where the current financial statements are used for the first five years, and then an assessment is done on what the company will look like 10 years into the future. Then, a terminal value computation is done in the final step. The assumptions are intentionally conservative. 
<br>
A summary of key assumptions is provided below for the valuation:
<br>
* **Revenue Growth:**  3% annual growth for 5 years (average historical growth) and decreasing gradually to a stable rate of 1.5% (low-risk scenario) in perpetuity.  The semiconductor industry has faced a sharp decrease in demand over the past year as mentioned in Ingersoll Rand's Q3 2023 earnings call, so assuming low future growth is prudent. 
* **Operating Margin:** Gradually increasing from 13.7% to a terminal margin of 15% (lower end of industry average). Competitive pressures may limit margin expansion.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** A reinvestment rate of 20% is assumed for the first five years and decreasing gradually to 10% (conservative assumption) in perpetuity.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9.3%, reflecting the increased risk associated with cyclicality.
* **Tax Rate:** Effective tax rate of 20%.


**Detailed Calculations:**
(See images for forecast period financials, as they don't fit here)

**Terminal Value Calculation:**
```
Terminal Value = (NOPLAT in year 6 * (1 + Stable Growth Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Stable Growth Rate)
              = ($1,099 million * (1 + 0.015)) / (0.093 - 0.015)
              = $14,316 million
```

**Present Value of Cash Flows:**

Discount each year's free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and the terminal value back to present value using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). (See images for table). The result is a present value of cash flows to the firm of $12,658 million.

**Final Steps:**

1. **Add back cash and marketable securities:**  $677 million (as of Q3 2023).
2. **Subtract value of minority interest:**  Using average price/book ratio of minority interest holdings, the value is estimated at $38 million.
3. **Subtract value of debt:** $8,207 million (as of Q3 2023)
4. **Value of employee options:**  Option pricing method described in the valuation books is used to estimate the value of options. (See images for full calculations)  $221 million.
5. **Number of shares:** 175 million (as of Q3 2023).

**Value per Share:**

```
Value of Equity = Value of operating assets + Cash – Debt + Value of employee stock options - Minority interest
              = $12,658 + $677 - $8,207 +$221 -$38 = $5,311 million

Value per share = Value of Equity / Number of Shares
               = $5,311 million / 175 million
               = $30.34/share
```

**Sensitivity Analysis and Scenarios:**

By varying key inputs, like revenue growth and operating margins, you can create different scenarios and assess their impact on the valuation. (See images for scenario-based valuation) The implied valuation suggests that Ingersoll Rand is currently fairly valued.


**Concerns:**

* **Cyclicality:**  The industrial businesses are cyclical and therefore vulnerable to economic downturns. As revealed by IR in its Q3 2023 earnings call, there was significant macroeconomic uncertainty, with high interest rates, causing lower demand and reduced profitability. This cyclicality, as discussed in "The Little Book of Valuation", makes estimating future cash flows and discount rates challenging.
* **Competitive Intensity:**  IR operates in competitive industries, which limits its pricing power and profitability.  Technological disruption, as exemplified by Clayton Christensen’s discussion of disruptive innovations in "The Innovator's Dilemma", poses a continuous threat.
* **Acquisition Risk:** The company's reliance on acquisitions for growth introduces integration and execution risks. There are always integration problems after an acquisition, as discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth". In addition, a key element to value creation in an acquisition decision, from the acquirer’s perspective, is the price paid as also discussed in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies"
* **Debt Levels:**  Relatively high debt levels could amplify earnings volatility and increase the risk of financial distress. This debt is being serviced for now as also explained by IR in its 2021 earnings call, but if the economy heads towards recession, this could hurt their margins for the next few years.
* **Long-Term Growth:**  While management has ambitious goals for long-term growth, achieving them is not guaranteed.


**Recent Developments:**

* **Q3 2023 Earnings Call:**  The company reported solid revenue growth in its latest earnings call, but it also mentioned significant macroeconomic uncertainty and lower demand from some of its business segments.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Successful Acquisitions:** accretive acquisitions could enhance the company's portfolio and drive future growth. In its Q3 2023 earnings call, the company mentioned several acquisitions it had made recently and that it was looking forward to more acquisitions.
* **Emerging Market Growth:** Continued growth in emerging markets could boost long-term revenue growth as discussed in the "Valuation" book, especially for cyclical businesses.
* **Margin Improvement Initiatives:** Successful execution of cost-cutting and pricing strategies could lead to stronger margins, as explained in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth". However, in today's markets with cheaper labor and capital, new competitors with smaller business models have shown up, and it will become difficult for Ingersoll Rand to implement any significant cost advantages over its competitors.
* **New Product Innovation:** New product development could lead to a temporary increase in revenues, or possibly new pricing models for the company, but a successful new product offering requires to be accompanied by sustainable ROIC and revenue growth.

 **Overall:**

Ingersoll Rand is a solid industrial company with some potential for growth, but its competitive landscape and cyclicality warrant a cautious outlook. The company's valuation is fair, but not sufficiently compelling to merit a higher rating. The management team appears competent, but not exceptional. The lack of a durable competitive advantage and reliance on acquisitions for growth make this a moderate-risk, moderate-return investment.
