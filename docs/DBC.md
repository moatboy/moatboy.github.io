{: .highlight }
This ETF does not have a moat. By nature, it's a passive fund that tracks an index which does not have an economic moat of its own.
**Moat: 1/5**
*   **Justification:** DBC is a passive index-tracking ETF. It does not have any internal means to create a sustainable competitive advantage, or moat. Its performance is entirely tied to the underlying commodity index, which can be influenced by various market factors and has nothing to do with the fund itself.  There is no real advantage a fund like this can have that its competitors can not replicate, meaning investors would gain no sustainable advantage by investing in this ETF. As such there's nothing that can protect the high returns or allow the ETF to extract more profits.

**Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience**
*   **Tracking Error:**  DBC is not a direct replication of the underlying index due to costs and the use of futures contracts, which can introduce a tracking error. Tracking error is the divergence between the performance of a portfolio and the benchmark. If this divergence becomes significant, investors may begin choosing similar ETFs that manage to more closely track the underlying index. For example, a poor performance on the part of the fund due to a high tracking error would be a risk.
*   **Roll Risk:** The use of futures contracts exposes the ETF to roll risk—when the fund rolls contracts to avoid contract expiration, it must do so at a price that is not always favorable. This means that the performance of the ETF can deviate, to an extent, from that of the underlying index.
*   **Counterparty Risk:** Funds that use derivatives, like DBC, also have counterparty risk. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party involved in a transaction will default. Counterparty risk may arise for DBC in case of its counterparty (the party that provides leverage for buying contracts) going bust.
*   **Political and Economic Instability:** The performance of the underlying commodities is influenced by numerous factors, including inflation, political instability, economic activity and supply chain disruptions. Given the breadth of commodities tracked by the index, these are more likely to affect the ETF. A geopolitical conflict can drive oil higher, while an economic downturn can lower the demand for industrial metals. The performance is influenced by various external factors that the ETF has no control over, meaning it can not guarantee high returns even if its performance and strategy are well executed.

**Business Overview**
*   **Revenue Distribution:** DBC does not have any operations in the traditional sense. The fund’s purpose is to track the price of commodities. The fund generates income through its holdings, interest, and other gains. All revenue and income are allocated to its shareholders.

*   **Industry Trends:** The commodity market can be volatile, as it is impacted by many macroeconomic factors. Commodities also show cyclical behavior. There can be long periods of stagnation, with subsequent periods of rapid price increases. The performance of the commodity market is based on many factors such as economic growth, geopolitical instability, inflation and weather. Because the ETF tracks such a wide variety of commodities, these factors will affect its performance.

*   **Margins:** There are no operating margins for DBC. The ETF provides a passive tracking strategy, meaning it will track the index whether or not the underlying assets perform well. Fees charged by the ETF will be a factor in the ETF performance. However, these fees tend to be very low as the ETF is primarily tracking the performance of its index.

*   **Competitive Landscape:** There are many commodity ETFs available in the market that track a wide variety of different indices and strategies. A key competitive factor between such ETFs is the fees they charge. Expense ratio or fees for DBC is 0.85% per year, which is not the lowest in the field.

*   **Differentiation:** The main way the fund is different from its competitors is that the fund tracks the DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Excess Return. This index offers a dynamic and optimized approach for managing commodity exposure. This approach, however, has been backtested, meaning its real-world performance may not match backtested performance.

{: .note }
One of the main objectives of a commodity fund is to provide a shield from inflation. So any increase in commodity prices, due to inflation, will directly reflect in the ETF's value.

**Financials In Depth**
*    The fund's objective is to track the DBIQ Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Index Excess Return. This implies that the fund is obligated to use techniques that can track the performance of the index. The fund’s objective is not to generate returns for investors.
*    The fund relies on leverage from counterparty institutions to make up for the leverage, but that means if the institutions go bust the fund is at risk of losing a lot.
*   The fund's financial performance is primarily driven by the underlying commodities, with minimal operational overhead and thus minimal variability.
*    The key factor of the fund that drives the price of its shares is how the prices of the underlying futures contracts change.
*    The fund has an annual fee of 0.85% which is above average in the industry, but not excessively high.

**Understandability: 1/5**
*    **Justification:** As a commodity ETF, DBC is simple to understand. The product does not require a lot of analysis or knowledge about a company, only an understanding of the underlying index, what it tracks, and its associated risks and returns. The underlying index is designed to track commodity futures contracts from all sectors, therefore one is not required to be familiar with any one specific sector. It's a simple passive product that provides a set of investment instruments.

**Balance Sheet Health: 5 / 5**
*   **Justification:** The fund has no debt and also a great access to debt if needed. However, it is designed to track the prices of commodities and has no internal business as the source of its returns. This implies its health is totally dependent on the economic conditions and will, in turn, reflect in its price. This means that the underlying commodities pose much more important risks to the ETFs health than its financial position. Furthermore, the fund uses futures contracts that have little balance sheet implications in terms of credit risk to the fund.
