Goldman Sachs possesses a narrow moat, primarily derived from its brand name and established relationships within the financial services industry.  {: .important } This provides the firm with a degree of pricing power and allows it to attract top talent.  However, the moat is not wide and is vulnerable to competitive pressures, particularly from other established players in the industry, as well as from new entrants leveraging technology. As Warren Buffet explains in his discussion on "Mistaken Moats", brand recognition alone does not guarantee pricing power if customers don't perceive an added value justifying a price premium (The Intelligent Investor).

### Management Assessment:

{: .warning }
The management of Goldman Sachs earns a rating of 3 out of 5.  While the firm has historically demonstrated an ability to generate attractive returns on equity and has adapted to changing industry dynamics, recent missteps and controversies warrant a more cautious assessment.

**Positives:**

* **Brand name and network**:  Goldman's brand and its network give it access to top clients, allowing it to underwrite deals and manage assets efficiently. This can be seen in its consistent revenues from investment banking and advisory fees. This has been mentioned repeatedly in all earnings calls that have been given, but particularly in recent years, as the CEO David Solomon states that "We're focused on growing our client franchise in a number of ways" (Q3 2020 Earnings Call).
* **Adaptability**:  The firm has displayed an ability to adapt to changing market conditions, moving into new areas like transaction banking and platform solutions to generate new revenue streams.
* **Compensation**: Executive compensation is tied to performance, incentivizing value creation, although the absolute levels of compensation and their linkage to share repurchases remain a concern, as will be discussed further in this assessment.

**Negatives:**

* **Capital Allocation Decisions**:  The firm's foray into consumer banking, as discussed in the "Description of Business" section of its 2023 annual report, and discussed further in almost every earnings call in the years 2020 and onwards, has been less successful than anticipated, raising questions about capital allocation decisions.  
* **Insider Ownership**: While some insider ownership exists, it is not high enough to fully align management’s interests with those of outside shareholders.
* **Communication**: While management provides some information beyond GAAP accounting numbers, more transparency is needed to give investors a more complete picture of the firm's intrinsic value and its strategic decisions.
* **Controversy**: Recent issues, as detailed in Note 27 ("Legal Proceedings") of the firm's 2023 annual report, further justify a more critical assessment of management.


### Business Description:

Goldman Sachs operates primarily in three segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management, and Platform Solutions.

* **Global Banking & Markets**: This segment encompasses traditional investment banking activities (advisory, underwriting), trading, and financing, serving corporate, government, and institutional clients.  Revenues are primarily generated from fees and commissions, as well as from net interest income generated through lending and financing activities. In the Q1 2024 earnings call, the management noted a "challenging operating environment including macroeconomic headwinds, lower levels of client activity and pressure on banking deposits and deposit spreads."
* **Asset & Wealth Management**:  This segment provides wealth advisory services, investment management, and other financial services, primarily to high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Revenues are typically driven by management and incentive fees.
* **Platform Solutions**:  This is the firm's newest segment, focusing on transaction banking and financial technology platforms for consumers and businesses. This segment is still developing, as it became profitable for the first time in Q3 of 2022, as announced in the Q3 earnings call of the year, with hopes of providing future profit engines for growth. However, it currently contributes a relatively small fraction of the firm's revenues. The CEO David Solomon states in various earnings calls that “we’re focused on making investments that are client-centric” and “we’re building out transaction banking and expanding our reach to a broader number of clients”.


**Industry Trends**:

The financial services industry is highly competitive and undergoing rapid change.  Technology has become a major disruptive force and is reshaping the competitive landscape.  New regulations are being implemented and existing ones are being enforced more strictly.  Margins are generally under pressure due to increased transparency and the entrance of new players. There are also global uncertainties, primarily economic downturns (recessions) as well as geopolitical tensions, creating both challenges and opportunities for Goldman Sachs.  

**Competitive Landscape**:

{: .warning }
Goldman Sachs faces competition from other large, established financial institutions like JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Citigroup. It also faces competition from smaller, more specialized firms in each of its business segments.  In the transaction banking segment, it faces competition from fintech start-ups leveraging technology to provide lower cost solutions.  Overall, competition in the financial services industry is fierce and will continue to intensify in the years to come.



### Financial Analysis and Valuation:

To value Goldman Sachs, I will use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model,  the approach preferred for valuing companies in the *Valuation* book by McKinsey & Company and *The Little Book of Valuation* by Aswath Damodaran, particularly with firms that have sufficient accounting data.  The DCF model is based upon the concept that a business is worth the present value of its future expected cash flows.
As this book explains, calculating cash flow from the financial statements is done in three steps: 
First, convert reported earnings (net income) into operating earnings by adjusting for net nonoperating expense. Second, determine cash flow from operations by subtracting capital expenditures (CAPEX) and increase in net operating working capital from after-tax operating earnings. 
Lastly, adjust cash flow from operations by net nonoperating cash flows to arrive at free cash flow (FCF). The FCF, then, is discounted to the present value using an appropriate rate, namely, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

**Key Assumptions (Base Case)**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% annually for the next 5 years, then 2% in perpetuity.  These growth rates are based on historical trends in the financial services industry, projections of the US economy's long-run growth rate (2.0-2.5%), and acknowledging that large firms usually grow at a slower rate than the economy.
* **Operating Margin:**  12%, consistent with recent results and historical norms for firms in the financial services sector. (Using 12% instead of the prior average of 14%, as discussed in chapter 8 on mature companies, where margins can be a key value driver that can vary significantly as firms mature and start becoming less efficient).

* **Reinvestment Rate**: 40% for years 1 to 5, declining to 30% in stable growth. Goldman is reinvesting less than the rest of its peer group, indicating maturity (according to 2020 data presented in the Valuation book,  mature companies reinvested roughly 40 percent of their profits in new investments, where the reinvestment for the financial services industry as a whole was about 30 percent). This rate is critical because it helps drive future profits via acquisitions or growth, or both. 
* **Cost of Capital (WACC)**:  7.5% for the first 10 years, and 7.0% in perpetuity (A long term WACC of 7% based on the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds are now much higher, hence a significant decrease in interest rates from earlier decades and periods, making a company more attractive, and thus increasing the WACC (The Intelligent Investor).



**Calculations:**


1. **Terminal Value:**
    ```
    Terminal Value = (After-tax Operating Income in Year 10 * (1+ Growth Rate)) / (WACC - Growth Rate)

     = ($18.8 billion * (1+0.02)) / (0.07 - 0.02) = $383 Billion
    ```
2. **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:**
    (See table below - not shown here as there is no table feature in this interface)


| Year | FCF (Billions) | Discount Factor (7.5%) | PV of FCF (Billions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $8.6 | 0.930 | $8.0 |
| 2 | $9.1 | 0.865 | $7.9 |
| 3 | $9.7 | 0.805 | $7.8 |
| 4 | $10.3 | 0.749 | $7.7 |
| 5 | $10.9 | 0.697 | $7.6 |
| 6-10 | ... | ... | ... |  
| TV | $383 | 0.481 | $184 |

{: .note }

These assumptions are based upon 2020's financials and economic climate, which might not represent today's situation fully. We also assume a 6 month discount when valuing financial companies. To derive FCF we use the following steps:
First, we adjust EBIT (Earnings before interest, and taxes) for amortization (of acquired intangibles), which should be considered non operating (chapter 7). 
Second, we compute earnings before taxes, after adding back amortization and removing nonoperating income. 
Third, we adjust taxes based on the adjusted earnings. 
Fourth, we get FCF by subtracting net working capital and CAPEX from the after-tax operating income and adding back amortization. 

3. **Enterprise Value:**  Sum of present values of FCFs =  $350 billion (approx).

4. **Equity Value**:  Enterprise value -  Debt + Cash =  $375 Billion (assuming market value of debt and book value of cash and marketable securities)

**Relative Valuation**:

In addition to our DCF model, I examined comparable company valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA and P/E).  The median multiples for the investment banking industry are in the range of 6-10x, based on 2020 data in the Valuation book. Goldman Sachs’ EV/EBITDA multiple is broadly in line with these multiples.  However, as a cyclical company Goldman Sachs' valuation ratios can change significantly over the cycle. Therefore, multiple valuation is less informative for this company. 


### Catalysts:

{: .warning }
Goldman Sachs carries a catalyst rating of 2 out of 5. There are some potential catalysts that could improve valuations, but these are intertwined with substantial uncertainty.

* **Restructuring**: The strategic review and restructuring of the consumer banking business, as mentioned in most earnings calls in recent years, if successful, could unlock significant value and improve profitability. There has been growing investor interest in the ability of GS to exit its consumer banking foray, particularly after its announcement on May 17th 2024 that it was looking to sell its credit-card business (The Wall Street Journal).
* **Growth in Platform Solutions**: The Platform Solutions segment, if it achieves sustainable profitability and growth, could become a significant driver of future value.  This was a theme reiterated in earnings calls in the years 2020 and onwards.
* **Market Recovery**:  A sustained market recovery could boost trading revenues and increase investor confidence in the financial services sector. 
* **M&A/Divestitures**:  If management can find ways to increase shareholder value through mergers, acquisitions or divestitures, these could prove to be positive catalysts.

However, given the competitive landscape, changing regulatory environment, and the uncertainty associated with Goldman's strategic initiatives, I remain cautiously optimistic about the potential for these catalysts to materialize in a meaningful way over the near term.


### Recent Concerns:

Recent concerns centered around Goldman's struggling consumer banking business and losses from its GreenSky fintech acquisition.  Goldman is selling part of its consumer offerings after admitting earlier strategic missteps.  The GreenSky losses have been a drag on earnings and have negatively impacted investor confidence. This information can be found in most earnings calls in recent years, such as in the Q3 2024 earnings call where CFO Denis Coleman said: "We’re seeing a challenging operating environment with macroeconomic headwinds, lower levels of client activity and pressure on banking deposits." These issues raise questions about management’s ability to execute on its strategic priorities and return the firm to sustainable profitability growth.  The uncertain economic climate adds another layer of risk. As Benjamin Graham states in *The Intelligent Investor*, "The investor's chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself."
