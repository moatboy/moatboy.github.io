*   **AI** is increasing chip use cases and is quickly changing the semiconductor industry landscape.

#### Profitability and Margins:
{: .highlight }
Texas Instruments has had good profits and free cash flow consistently, but their margins can vary because of their business model being capital intensive and prone to business cycles.
 Their operating margins have been variable, but recently improving: 42.4% for the first half of 2024, 34.1% for full-year 2023, 46.6% for full-year 2022, and 51.6% for full-year 2021. 
The gross profit margins are good at 67.2% in the latest quarter.
For the latest earnings call, they did see weakness in their industrial and automotive segments.
They are still very focused on maintaining high profit margins and disciplined operating expenses.

#### Competitive Landscape:
*   The analog market is competitive, but TI has a strong presence and wide selection of products.
*   The embedded processing market is more competitive, and commoditization and pricing pressures exist. 
*   They face competition from other big players like AMD, Nvidia, and Intel in various segments.

#### What Makes Texas Instruments Different?
*   They have a vast portfolio of products covering multiple applications, which insulates them from competition in a specific segment.
*   They are moving more and more into software and solutions, rather than focusing only on hardware, which makes them more valuable. 
*   Their emphasis on their own manufacturing capacity allows them to control their supply chain effectively.
*  Their distribution network is widespread and they can make their production lines more versatile through the technology they have created. 

### Moat Assessment:
Texas Instruments possesses a *narrow* economic moat due to:
*   **Intangible assets:** their diverse portfolio of products, and their brand recognition provides some protection.
*   **Switching Costs:** Many customers use their software and hardware together, increasing switching costs for existing clients.

The rating is not higher, because of
*   **Rivalry among firms:** Other competitors are improving their processes and technology to compete more effectively with Texas Instruments.
*   **Threat of substitutes:** The risk of substitutions in tech industries is always there.

#### Moat Rating: 3 / 5.

### Risks to the Moat and Business:
*  **Dependence on technological advancements:** if they fail to keep up with technology advancements, they may struggle. This may come from either the product side or the manufacturing process side. The semiconductor industry is fast-moving, and what is great today may be mediocre tomorrow.
*  **Cyclicality of the semiconductor market:** Their earnings and demand for their products are highly dependent on the industrial and overall economy. Any sudden downturn can be harmful to sales.
*  **Competitive pressures:** Their competitive pressures may intensify if they don't keep their technology and supply chain advantages. 
*  **Dependence on government incentives:** Their growth strategy relies heavily on various governments giving them incentives or tax exemptions.
*  **Geopolitical risks:** China, which is where their manufacturing facilities are based, is becoming a high risk market and they may need to diversify their supply chain.

#### Business Resilience:
TXN does seem to be very resilient, and they have weathered many challenges in the past. They have large amounts of cash on hand and good free cash flow, meaning they have more flexibility. Also, their management has a sound understanding of the business cycle, giving them an ability to pivot. Their investments in R&D means that they are well-positioned for future developments.

### Financials:

*   **Income statement**: In the latest quarter, revenues were \$4.53B, net income was \$1.72B and earnings per share (EPS) was \$1.85. Their revenue declined from $5.07B in 2022, primarily due to an economic slowdown. Operating expenses increased from $1.27B to $1.34B. Other financial numbers, which include interest income and loss, decreased to -$0.2B from 0.1B. Overall, net income is down from $2.42B last year.
   Their income from various segments has been very fluctuating, with the segments responsible for revenue change varying greatly. For the latest quarter, embedded processing was stable and even grew a little, while analog took the most of the hit. They have been focusing on improving their operating margins and gross margins to improve their financials.  
   Their recent revenues have been impacted by reduced inventory levels at their major customers in the Industrial segment. These customers, like car manufacturers and equipment suppliers, have been reducing the amount of parts that they keep on hand because demand is slightly low. This is affecting Texas Instruments' profits and revenues.
*   **Balance sheet:** The company has a very strong balance sheet. They have over $6.9B in cash and short-term investments. Long-term debt is only at $14.9B. Their current liabilities are $3.6B, making them well-capitalized. Their net working capital was at $17.1B.
    They have made various changes in the investment section of their balance sheet because they moved money into short term marketable funds, which are safe and readily accessible.
    Their goodwill has also decreased to almost zero as they reduced acquisitions and amortized the remaining intangible assets.
*    **Cash flow statement**: Cash flow from operations have been positive and quite large. In 2023, they had cash flow from operations of $6.5B. They repurchased a massive $3.6B worth of shares in the last 12 months. As we had mentioned, they keep a large cash position, and the increase from short-term investments gives them an added advantage when looking at cash flow.
    They continue to invest heavily in their core businesses by increasing capital expenditures. Their free cash flow yield is over 4 percent at the moment, which also shows good fundamentals in cash flow.

#### Balance Sheet Health: 5 / 5
Texas Instruments has a very strong balance sheet with a lot of liquidity and low debt. They also have a positive cash position, making them well suited to withstand any future downturns or economic issues.

The sheer number of different products and technologies makes it hard for even financial experts to ascertain their position in the market and see their competitive advantages. 

To make it easier, they are essentially a company that makes parts for other companies to use in making a final product, ranging from a car to a medical device. These parts usually are integrated circuits and other semiconductors that convert or process data or energy in some way. Their profitability is highly tied to the number of different customers they have. Since the number of end applications of their products is so diverse, their business can be affected by a variety of factors from geopolitical situations to advancements in technology. This makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the business, its competitive position, and future performance. 

Also, financial reports are complex because of high capital expenditures that are not easily distinguishable from operating expenses and there is also a lot of accounting gymnastics involved in order to ascertain their real profits.
