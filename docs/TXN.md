{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**  TXN possesses a narrow moat. While it doesn't dominate every market it serves, its entrenched position in analog and embedded processing, extensive product portfolio, and long-standing customer relationships create meaningful switching costs and economies of scale. 

> A moat is not just a desirable attribute but a crucial measure of the business itself. *From "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies"*

TXN's broad product portfolio and manufacturing prowess enhance customer stickiness.  However, the semiconductor industry is inherently cyclical and faces intense competition, particularly from Asian manufacturers, limiting its moat.

**Management (3/5):**

TXN's management receives a moderate rating. The long tenure of many executives provides valuable institutional knowledge, but also raises concerns about complacency and entrenchment.  

> Companies and boards sometimes mistakenly believe that a long and glorious past is a prologue to an equally glorious future. (*from "Valuation")*

Positive factors include:

* **Focus on long-term value creation:** Management repeatedly emphasizes a long-term focus in earnings calls and investor presentations (as seen in their earnings call in Q1 of 2024). This aligns with intrinsic value principles as per "Valuation".
* **Disciplined capital allocation:** The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases (as detailed in their 2023 10-K). This is consistent with a shareholder-friendly approach, valued by investors like Warren Buffett, as highlighted in the "Essays of Warren Buffett".
* **Compensation tied to performance:** Executive compensation is partially tied to company performance, which, while not perfect, at least aims to align management and shareholder interests. (*from "The Essays of Warren Buffett")*

Negative factors include:

* **Limited insider ownership:** While some executives have significant holdings, overall insider ownership is relatively low (as detailed in multiple 10-K filings over the years). This raises concerns about how strongly aligned management is with shareholders. (*from Michael Burry's investment journals*)
* **Potential for complacency:** TXN's long-term success and dominant position in certain markets may lead to complacency and a resistance to change, making them vulnerable to disruptive innovations. (*from "Valuation")*
* **Opacity in communication:**  While management talks about long-term strategy, communication about specific value drivers and performance by business segment could be more transparent. (*Inspired by Michael Burry's approach to investigating company information*)

**Catalyst (2/5):** TXN's catalyst rating is moderate. Growth in industrial automation, automotive, and personal electronics should drive demand for the company's products, but the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the ongoing competition pose challenges. The company's reinvestment in manufacturing capacity (as highlighted in TXN's 2023 10-K and earnings calls), while potentially creating a future drag, could eventually lead to stronger long-term results if the demand for its products is higher than what is currently being priced in. However, there are also risks associated with this.


**Business:**

* **Revenues:** TXN derives its revenues from a diverse set of end markets (as detailed in its 10-K).  This diversification helps mitigate risks, but individual segments are still affected by sector-specific dynamics. Recent results have been mixed (as revealed in their latest 10-Ks). They recently had some success with their embedded business, for instance, as discussed in their Q1 2024 earnings call.
* **Margins:** TXN historically enjoyed healthy operating margins, but these can fluctuate with the business cycle (as shown in their financial reports). The company faces pressure to maintain margins given pricing pressures from competitors, especially in analog (highlighted in various earnings calls).
* **Competitive Landscape:** TXN operates in a highly competitive industry, with major players like Analog Devices and NXP. Competition is on price, performance, and product features. TXN differentiates itself through its manufacturing scale, its process technology expertise, and its deep customer relationships.
* **Trends:** The semiconductor industry is being reshaped by several trends, including the rise of electric vehicles (as discussed in "Valuation") and the increasing demand for industrial automation and connectivity. TXN is well positioned to benefit from these trends, but they also intensify competition and create pressure for ongoing innovation.  (*from "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies")*

**Financials:**

* **Revenue growth:** TXN has seen revenue growth in recent years, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions, but the future is uncertain (*from "Valuation"). 
* **Return on invested capital (ROIC):** TXN's ROIC has been historically healthy, consistently exceeding its cost of capital (as shown in their financial reports). However, ROIC faces pressure from rising capital expenditures (discussed in multiple earnings calls).

**Valuation ($145 Billion):**


The valuation uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, with a pessimistic outlook. The following key inputs were used for this calculation:

* **Revenue growth:**  A modest revenue growth rate of 2% annually was used for the next five years, followed by a stable growth rate of 0%  (based on the cyclical nature of its business, and its relatively mature stage as revealed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*).
* **Operating margin:** An operating margin of 25% was used (TXN's long-term average).
* **Reinvestment rate:**  A reinvestment rate of 10% was assumed (based on TXN's historical capital expenditures).
* **Cost of capital:** A cost of capital of 9% was used (calculated using a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5.5%, a beta of 1.0, an effective tax rate of 25%, and a debt ratio of 15%).  This is higher than what the management is assuming in the most recent years, but reflects my more pessimistic outlook.

> Always be honest about your biases. Why did you pick this company to value? Do you dislike the company? Why? These biases might show up on paper, because with all these pitfalls, why bother with book value? (*from Valuation*)

* **Terminal value:** The terminal value was computed using a perpetual growth rate of 0% (reflecting the mature/cyclical nature of the business) .

**Calculations:**

1. **Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF):** FCFF was projected for the next 10 years using the above inputs.
2. **Terminal value:**  The terminal value at the end of year 10 was calculated using the perpetual growth rate and the cost of capital.
3. **Present value:** The present values of the FCFF and the terminal value were calculated using the cost of capital.
4. **Enterprise value:** The enterprise value was calculated by summing the present values of the FCFF and the terminal value.
5. **Equity value:** The equity value was calculated by subtracting the value of debt and other non-equity claims from the enterprise value.
6. **Value per share:** The value per share was calculated by dividing the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.


This DCF valuation process, with its conservative assumptions, results in a value of approximately $145 billion for TXN. 

> The true test of your valuation skills is when you have to value difficult-to-value companies. (*from Aswath Damodaran's valuation course*)

**Conclusion:**

TXN is a solid company with a narrow moat. Its current stock price appears reasonable given the model's output, but investors should be aware of the cyclical nature of its business and the intense competition it faces. The management, while generally competent, could do more to improve transparency and long-term value creation. The potential upside from their reinvestment in capacity (as discussed in earnings calls in 2024 and earlier) represents a moderate catalyst for the stock, though investors should closely monitor execution.
