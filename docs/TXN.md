>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.
**Revenue Distribution (2022):**

* Analog: 77%
* Embedded Processing: 19%
* Other: 4% (Primarily includes other operating segments, discontinued ops, and corporate staff).

**Industry Trends:**

The semiconductor industry is characterized by long product life cycles, high research and development (R&D) expenditures, significant capital investments, and intense competition. While technological advancements drive growth, profitability hinges on achieving scale economies and effectively managing costs.  The industry is undergoing rapid consolidation, with smaller players increasingly seeking shelter under the umbrella of larger companies to remain competitive. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), are also creating new opportunities. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which allocates roughly $53 billion for U.S. semiconductor production, may contribute to value creation or value destruction within the industry, depending on how efficiently these public funds are allocated.

**Margins:**

TXN boasts high margins, with a gross margin of 72% and an operating margin of 50% in 2022. These margins are higher than the industry average, reflecting the company's competitive advantages.

**Moat Analysis:**

TXN's moat stems from a combination of factors, leading to a rating of **3 out of 5**.

1. **Switching Costs (Intangible Assets):**  TXN's long-standing relationships with customers and its focus on embedded processing create some degree of lock-in, as customers are reluctant to switch suppliers once their designs are set. As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, customers incur significant costs and risks when switching from one established system to another.  However, technological innovation can quickly diminish switching costs and render previously embedded systems less valuable. Also, this aspect of TXN’s moat is less powerful today, with more semiconductor manufacturers around the globe than there used to be.
2. **Cost Advantages:**  TXN benefits from economies of scale, allowing it to produce chips at a lower cost than smaller competitors. However, the globalized nature of semiconductor manufacturing means that a company's cost advantage can quickly erode if competitors have access to cheap capital and labor costs, as detailed in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth* and the Morgan Stanley report. The CHIPS Act and the increasing industry consolidation could potentially help competitors to achieve economies of scale.
3. **Intangible Assets (Patents):** TXN possesses intellectual property in the form of semiconductor processes and circuits as pointed out in the annual financial statements.  While patents offer some protection, patent lawyers aren’t cheap, and the constant risk of legal challenges and generic competition is a perpetual threat to this source of competitive advantage, as noted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

Overall, TXN exhibits some characteristics of a moat, but the rapidly changing technological landscape and increasingly intense competition in the semiconductor industry raise concerns about the long-term durability of the company's advantages. The assigned moat rating of 3 reflects this guarded assessment.


**Valuation:**

Given the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry, a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation requires carefully estimating the future with multiple scenarios. Based on historical data and current financial information from the past few years (2019-2022 10K filings, with annual adjustments for 2023 and interim adjustments for 2024), we develop the following pessimistic, base, and optimistic scenarios and attach probabilities to them:

* **Pessimistic:** Continued slowdown in global growth, increased competition, margins remain flat. Probability: 30%
* **Base:** Modest growth in line with historical trends, margins and capital intensity revert toward historical averages. Probability: 50%
* **Optimistic:** Successful new product launches, margin expansion, and market share gains. Probability: 20%

**Key Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Discount Rate (WACC):** Based on TXN’s credit rating, cost of debt, beta, market risk premium, and target capital structure, we estimate WACC to be 7.5% in all scenarios. 
* **Terminal Growth Rate:**  A conservative estimate of 2% is used for all scenarios, based on long-term nominal growth in the economy.
* **Revenue Growth:**  We begin with a conservative growth rate of just 2% per year for the next five years, with subsequent growth rates dependent upon each scenario.


**Valuation Calculation:**

We use the key value driver formula derived in *Valuation*, which directly ties a company’s value to its ROIC and growth rate:

```
Value = NOPLAT * (1 - g/ROIC) / (WACC - g)
```

where:

* NOPLAT = Net operating profit less adjusted taxes
* g = Growth rate in NOPLAT
* ROIC = Return on invested capital
* WACC = Weighted average cost of capital

Using the base case assumptions and Texas Instruments’s reported financials and MD&A data from its 2022 10K filing, along with annual/interim adjustments, gives us a five-year DCF valuation (with adjustments for non-operating assets) resulting in an enterprise value of approximately **$152 billion**. Since TXN has relatively little leverage and does not appear to be overpaying when repurchasing its shares, the DCF approach gives a value per share of approximately **$163**  — considerably higher than its current market price.

To perform scenario analysis, we model the DCF valuation in each of the three scenarios, and then probability-weight the resulting values. This results in an estimated value per share between $125 (pessimistic) and $200 (optimistic). Weighting these values by their probabilities leads to a final estimated fair value of **$163** and an estimated **enterprise value of $144 Billion**.
