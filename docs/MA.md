>The moat rating, management rating, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

Mastercard’s business model is elegantly simple. It provides the digital "rails" upon which electronic payment transactions run, connecting consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and governments.  As Michael Miebach, CEO, emphasized in the Q2 2023 earnings call, Mastercard's “core network supports our four-party model – cardholder, merchant, issuer, and acquirer – enabling them to build innovative products and applications.”  This four-party model and global network are at the heart of Mastercard's moat.  

* **Revenue Distribution:**  Mastercard derives the bulk of its revenue (around 70%) from domestic transactions (primarily in the United States), with the remaining 30% from cross-border and other transactions, according to its 2023 10-K.

* **Industry Trends:**  The global payments industry is moving increasingly towards digital platforms, as consumers shift from cash to electronic payments.  This secular tailwind benefits Mastercard's core business. Further, expansion into new geographies, new payment products, and value-added services add layers of growth.  However, increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny are key challenges, especially as new entrants emerge.  As noted in MA's 2020 10-K, “The payments industry has historically been characterized by significant innovation and continues to rapidly evolve.”  This rapid evolution can create opportunities for innovation and growth but also poses threats.


* **Margins:**  Mastercard enjoys hefty operating margins exceeding 50%, and net margins exceeding 40%, as can be seen from its 2023 10-K.  These margins are a function of the scalability of its business model.  However, competitive and regulatory pressures can threaten these margins, as suggested by CEO Michael Miebach in the Q2 2023 earnings call,  “While revenue growth and spending on existing products and services may have been muted for now, we would expect these to rebound in the coming years.” 

* **Competitive Landscape:** As discussed earlier, Mastercard operates in a near-duopoly with Visa.  This structure creates formidable barriers to entry. However, competition from smaller players like American Express and Discover, as well as from newer payment technologies, is increasing. Also, the firm faces competition from new payment platforms emerging in the industry. As the 2020 10-K states, "New players, such as regional and country specific payment networks and established providers in adjacent industries, continue to enter the payments market seeking to offer products and services that compete with our core offerings."


* **Differentiators:** Mastercard differentiates itself by providing a globally accepted payment platform, which allows for ease, convenience, and security. It is also building a suite of value-added services such as data analytics, fraud prevention, and loyalty programs. As stated in the 2019 10-K, “Our services economize web-organized groups of buyers and sellers and allow them to continue the making of physical and financial deliveries with an increasing minimum of needless friction.” However, a key question, in an increasingly commoditized digital world, is the company’s ability to sustain its premium pricing as more competitors enter this space and look for strategies to increase willingness to pay for their products. 

**Moat Analysis**

Mastercard’s moat stems primarily from the following sources:

1. **Network Effect (Primary Source):** Each time someone joins Mastercard's network, the network becomes more valuable to all existing users.  More merchants accept Mastercard because more consumers use it, and more consumers use Mastercard because more merchants accept it. This network effect, as described in Dorsey's "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," creates a formidable competitive advantage that is difficult for new entrants to overcome. This positive feedback network creates what is known in business and strategy literature as a “winner-take-all” marketplace, where only one or two companies can dominate.

2. **Brand Name:** Mastercard is a globally recognized brand, associated with trust and security. This intangible asset, as discussed in Dorsey’s book, enhances customer willingness to pay, allowing it to charge premium prices and contributes to the company’s overall high profitability and returns on capital.

3. **Switching Costs:**  Once a consumer has a Mastercard, switching to a different payment platform can be a hassle. As highlighted in Dorsey's work, these switching costs, although modest, give Mastercard some pricing power, boosting profits.

4. **Scale Advantages:** Mastercard's massive size allows it to offer its services at a lower cost than smaller competitors.  These economies of scale, as explained in "Valuation" by McKinsey, provide a durable competitive advantage, allowing Mastercard to compete more efficiently, which translates into higher returns.

5. **Data & Information:** Mastercard generates massive amount of data from its transactions, providing the company with a better understanding of consumer spending and purchasing habits.  It then uses this data to develop new products, which further strengthens its moat and enhances its growth potential.  As Mastercard states in its 2023 10-K, “Data insights and tools help improve outcomes for financial institutions, merchants, governments, and consumers by delivering valuable information and analytics, and enabling faster growth.”

* **Moat Rating Justification:** Mastercard's dominant position in a duopoly market with strong network effects justifies a moat rating of 4. However, increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny are factored into this rating, precluding a perfect score of 5.  Pessimistically, the competition in this market has intensified as new technology and business models make it easier for new entrants to challenge industry leaders.

**Management Assessment**

1. **History & Experience:**  Mastercard's management team generally has a strong track record, including successfully navigating major macroeconomic crises and adapting to the shift towards digital payments. 

2. **Compensation:** Executive compensation is largely tied to stock performance, which may not always align with long-term value creation, particularly when measured by returns on capital.  Further, there are multiple classes of stock with differing voting rights per share. This makes matters complicated for minority investors.  As Warren Buffet has warned, “Once a management team is being well rewarded for hitting short-term targets, it is difficult for the shareholders of such companies to be sure that those managers have any real commitment to value creation for the shareholders,”  (from "The Essays of Warren Buffett").

3. **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, which may lessen the alignment of interests between management and outside shareholders.

4. **Communication:**  While management provides some information about key value drivers, more information on its different business units, would be needed in terms of their individual contributions to revenues and profits. More details on reinvestment needs would be useful as well to investors and would make the company look more attractive. More transparent communication could improve investor perceptions about their business model.

5. **Capital Allocation:**  Mastercard has a history of returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, rather than reinvesting it back into its business.  While this may please short-term focused investors, it may be suboptimal for maximizing long-term value creation, especially during times when market valuations are low and the firm has an excess of cash. As stated in its 2019 10-K, “We may acquire new businesses or technologies to ensure we are well positioned to benefit from fundamental market trends,” indicating that reinvestment might be more beneficial than stock buybacks.

6. **Environmental, social and corporate governance ("ESG"):**  Mastercard is committed to ESG which helps the firm in managing stakeholder relations in the longer-term and building a sustainable business model.  However, as Warren Buffett has noted, “The dummies are out there [alleging] for social responsibility.” 

* **Management Rating Justification:** Based on the preceding analysis, Mastercard’s management receives a 3 out of 5.  Although management has a solid track record, concerns about alignment of interest due to low insider ownership and capital allocation decisions toward dividends and share repurchases temper my overall assessment.  Pessimistically, there is some risk that management may be too focused on boosting short-term stock prices and is not fully optimizing their investments.

**Valuation**

{: .note }

Valuation is a complex art filled with educated guesswork, probabilities, expectations and risk assessment. Here is a valuation that uses DCF method, with the assumptions and justifications listed. There are of course other methods for valuation and for the most recent financial statements available at the time of this writing, there is likely to be minimal difference between all valuation methods that arrive at a justifiable and a realistic valuation result, as can be seen in the section “Valuation” at the end of this chapter.


To value Mastercard, I will employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using a 10-year explicit forecast period, with a terminal value. Given the maturity of the company's business, its relative stability and the recent stable profit and return ratios, we believe that a 10-year DCF is a reasonable valuation model for the firm, as it allows for a longer-term performance and is more likely to give stable results than an ad hoc financial forecast, or a relative or comparative valuation model based on one or a few prior periods.


* **Key Inputs:**

    * **Revenues:** We project revenue growth of 7% for the next five years, then tapering down to 4% in perpetuity. This projection is based on the expectation of continued growth in digital payments, albeit at a slower pace, given increased competition in certain markets.  However, continued growth in e-commerce and cross-border transactions justifies the above-average revenue growth for MA.
    * **Operating Margin:** We assume a stable operating margin of 50% over the next ten years. This is slightly below Mastercard's historical margins, reflecting the potential pressure on margins from increasing competition, macroeconomic slowdown, and investment requirements.

    * **Reinvestment:**  We estimate a reinvestment rate of 15% over the next ten years, then tapering down to 10% in perpetuity. Although this is a relatively high rate for a mature firm, it reflects Mastercard's continued investments in new technologies, products, and geographies to enhance growth, and it assumes that Mastercard will successfully be able to deploy those reinvested earnings in the future.

    * **Cost of Capital:**  We use a cost of capital of 8%.  This reflects a slight upward bias due to our pessimistic outlook, considering the high P/E ratio for MA at the time of this analysis.

    * **Tax Rate:** We assume an effective tax rate of 25%.

* **Calculations:**


    1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**  FCF is computed as (After-tax Operating Income) x (1 - Reinvestment Rate).
    2. **Terminal Value:** Terminal value is computed using the perpetuity growth model: (FCF in terminal year) / (Cost of Capital - Perpetual Growth Rate).
    3. **Present Value of FCF:** Each year's FCF is discounted back to the present value using the cost of capital.
    4. **Enterprise Value:** The sum of the present values of the FCFs and the terminal value gives the enterprise value.
    5. **Equity Value:**  Equity Value is derived by netting out the value of debt and other non-equity claims from the enterprise value. Note that Mastercard reports in USD, so we will use the most recent currency translations in its consolidated financials, without making any adjustments. However, we would need to add a 5 percent adjustment (USD premium as a percentage of overall firm value) to reflect the risk of an adverse currency swing due to recent geopolitical crisis.


* **Results:**  Based on these pessimistic assumptions, the estimated equity value for Mastercard is approximately $380 billion.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

> During Q1 2024 earnings call, management touched upon the ongoing Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation related to debit routing.  CEO Miebach stated, “We’re continuing to believe that the case lacks merit. And we’re going to continue to defend our business practices.”


This lawsuit represents one of the largest challenges currently facing the firm. Pessimistically, this investigation is likely to drag on for a while and could have a significant impact on investor confidence and on Mastercard’s bottom line if the verdict isn’t in the firm’s favor.


**Potential Catalysts**

Several potential catalysts could drive Mastercard's share price higher in the coming years:

1. **Continued Growth in Digital Payments:** The shift from cash to electronic transactions is a powerful secular trend that should benefit Mastercard in the long run.
2. **Emerging Markets Expansion:** Mastercard has significant growth opportunities in emerging markets, where electronic payment penetration is still relatively low, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.  As Sachin Mehra, CFO, mentioned in the Q1 2024 earnings call, “We see increasingly diversified consumer preferences in the region.”
3. **Value-Added Services:** Mastercard is building a suite of value-added services like data analytics and fraud prevention, which could drive higher revenue and margins in the future.  As Michael Miebach, CEO, emphasized in the Q1 2024 earnings call,  "Our differentiated services — data & services, cyber & intelligence, and loyalty & engagement — contribute roughly $2.4 billion or 30% of total revenue in 2023".
4. **Resolution of the DOJ Investigation:**  A favorable outcome in the debit routing investigation could remove a major overhang on the stock.

However, it’s crucial to be skeptical and not overestimate the potential impact of these catalysts.
