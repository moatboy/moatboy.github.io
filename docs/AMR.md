### Business Overview
{: .important }

AMR is a pure-play metallurgical coal producer, focusing solely on the steelmaking market. Its revenue is entirely dependent on the demand for high-quality metallurgical coal, making the company susceptible to fluctuations in steel prices and related industries.

#### Revenue Distribution and Trends
  - Domestic vs International: AMR primarily serves customers in the US and around the globe, particularly in Asia. The export market has increased with time, increasing its volatility.
  - Volatility: Demand for metallurgical coal depends on steel production, which is tied to broader economic cycles. Consequently, revenues can be highly volatile based on steel demand and pricing in various economic cycles.
  - Growth: AMR's strategy emphasizes a focus on high-quality metallurgical coal, which can sell at a premium.
 

#### Margins & Profitability
  - Price and Cost Sensitivity: Earnings depend on market prices for coal. Prices can be volatile based on supply and demand factors as well as the global economy. At the same time, cost of extraction and logistics can also fluctuate based on raw materials price and disruptions.
  - Fixed vs. Variable Costs: The production costs include fixed costs (such as equipment and labor), which don't change immediately based on market prices. However, variable costs increase or decrease based on input prices, such as mining equipment and transportation.
  -  Recent profitability in a cyclical industry: Recently there have been significant fluctuations in net profits and cashflows and that trend is likely to continue into 2024 with a downward outlook for the demand of coal.
  

#### Competitive Landscape
  - Highly Competitive: The coal industry is competitive, with many producers supplying similar products. This makes it difficult for companies to create a sustainable competitive advantage based on the product itself.
  - Few Differentiators: Companies compete primarily on price, cost structure, location, and reliability of supply rather than on product differentiation.
  - No long term contracts: The company usually operates in shorter term agreements, meaning the clients can switch to another company very quickly if it gives a better offer, without penalty.

#### What makes the company different
  - High-Quality Coal: Focus on high-quality metallurgical coal for steelmaking.
  - U.S. Production: A significant portion of its production is from the U.S., reducing reliance on overseas operations
  - Scale: it is one of the biggest metallurgical coal producers in the US

### Moat Assessment: 2/5
{: .important }

AMR's moat is very limited due to the commodity nature of its business. Here's a breakdown:

**Sources of limited competitive advantage:**
  -  While AMR has a long history in the US and is a prominent metallurgical coal supplier, the overall business lacks sustainable competitive advantage.
  -  **Scale:** While AMR is a prominent producer, it's still a small player on a global scale, meaning it cannot have a major pricing power.
  -  **Distribution:** It seems to rely on its customers providing their own transportation infrastructure.

**Lack of Sustainable Moats:**
    - **Commodity Product:** Metallurgical coal is a commodity, meaning customers don't have a strong preference for one brand over another.
   - **Pricing Power:** Since its a commodity, the pricing depends entirely on the market dynamics of supply and demand rather than AMR's ability to charge a higher price for its products.

### Moat Risks and Business Resilience
Here are the legitimate risks that can impair the limited moat and make the business more vulnerable
    - **Price Volatility:** The prices of coal are known to be highly volatile, and the main risk for AMR. The decline in coal prices directly affects the revenues and margins of the company.
     - **Economic slowdown:** As the steel industry is linked to the economy, AMR suffers if the economy is weak, because this reduces the demand for steel.
    -  **Competition:** Competitors, especially other coal producers might try to aggressively compete on prices, which might cause further contraction in the margins of AMR.
     - **Geopolitical Instability:** Export markets have become increasingly important for the company, thus, if there is turmoil in the export markets, the company could suffer a lot.
     - **Regulation**: Environmental regulations are a risk for the company as they might have to spend more to comply with them. In addition, governments might put caps on the prices or limit coal use altogether, all of which could affect their revenues.
    - **Technology**: The technology to produce steel is always changing, potentially phasing out the need for metallurgical coal.
        - **Disruptive innovation**: The risk of innovation impacting their methods of production, for example, the potential for hydrogen to take over as a primary material in steel production.

**Business Resilience:**

*   Given the nature of the business, AMR is susceptible to market cycles. 
*   A good degree of diversification among both domestic and international markets, should provide some cushion.
*   It has a good financial position, which should help it weather periods of low prices.

### Financial Deep-Dive
{: .important }

AMR's financial performance is primarily driven by metallurgical coal prices and production levels. Let's delve into their recent performance:

*   **Revenues**: The company has generated strong revenues recently from high prices and production volume, yet, there is a slowdown and decrease in revenues in the most recent reporting period as the market demand is shrinking. The revenues came in at $731.6M for three months ended 30th September 2023 versus $782.5M in 2022. The y-o-y decline is around -7% due to a decline in sales price and production volume.
*   **Profitability**: The company's profit has increased significantly in 2022 and early 2023 due to a jump in coal prices which they used to generate high net profit and EBITA values, but the outlook has become negative. There has been a drastic contraction in the margin due to lower coal prices, rising costs of operations, and decrease in output. For instance, the Operating income dropped drastically to $70 million in the most recent reporting period, from $309 million in 2022.
*   **Cash flow**: Operating cashflow decreased to $184M in the recent reporting period from $574M. The company also decreased cash used in investments and acquisitions, to -76M.
*   **Debt**: While the recent increase in debt is still high, the company has reduced its debt significantly over the last year, it is at approximately $400 million vs. $700 million last year, as most of the earnings are being used to pay back the debts to the creditors.
*   **Liquidity**: The liquidity of the company is still well above normal, even though its cash reserves have dropped with the debt repayments. It has roughly $200 million in cash.
*   **Share Repurchase:** The company has authorized a $150 million share repurchase program, a positive sign for shareholders.

**Summary:**

AMR benefited significantly from the high prices of metallurgical coal, but that is not expected to remain. The company's profitability has drastically reduced in the most recent reporting period. There are potential headwinds for the business and the future is uncertain for the company.

### Understandability: 2/5
{: .important }

AMR's business operations can be understood quite easily, however, the nature of coal market, the pricing, and how it reacts to macro economic factors such as inflation and the economy, makes it complex for a retail investor to predict and analyze its future with any accuracy.

### Balance Sheet Health: 4/5
{: .important }

AMR's balance sheet is relatively healthy. Debt levels have gone down, however, profitability has also taken a major hit. Cash levels remain reasonable. Key financial ratios such as working capital/debt and current assets/liabilities also point toward good financial standing.
