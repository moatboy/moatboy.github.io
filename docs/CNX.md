Their operations focus on maximizing value from their established assets and utilizing technological advancements to enhance production and efficiency. CNX also operates a midstream business including a gathering system, processing capabilities and water-handling services.

**Financials Deep Dive:**

CNX's financial performance is primarily driven by the price of natural gas and its production volumes. In recent periods, the company has focused on deleveraging and improving capital structure, rather than increasing production volume. Here's a more in-depth review of their recent financials. 

 **Recent Financial Performance:**
  * For the three months ended September 30, 2023, CNX reported a net loss of $13 million or $0.05 per share, compared to a net income of $713 million or $3.31 per share for the same period in 2022.
 *The decrease in Net income was primarily attributable to a reduction in commodity prices as well as lower production during the quarter.
*  Total revenues came at $384M for the latest quarter compared to $602M last year. The decrease comes from decreased wellhead pricing for both gas and oil.
 *The production in the quarter for natural gas declined 8% and 5% sequentially. 
*The company continues to focus on using their free cash flow to deleverage and they are using their operations to reduce costs.
*CNX continues to see a big demand for gas because it's essential to the power generation segment and for heating. The company continues to pursue new technologies to bring down costs and increase efficiency in production while being a good environmental steward.
* They have continued to repurchase debt and also buy back their own stock.
  *   A strong balance sheet and the company is focused on having a long runway of strong cash flow.

  *   **Liquidity**: CNX has a strong financial position and has significant liquidity to take care of future opportunities and obligations. The Company is planning to allocate a larger portion of their free cash flow towards debt repayment rather than capital investment.

*   **Debt:**  CNX has been focused on reducing debt, a process that has seen a reduction in debt from $3.1 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2023. The company has a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of ~1.7 which they plan to take down further in the near future. They continue to meet debt payments comfortably.

 * **Operating Cash flow** Net cash from operating activities was $394 million for the last quarter, compared to $780 million for the same period last year.

  **Shareholder Returns:**
    *CNX’s management has been trying to increase shareholder returns through various methods such as share buybacks, debt repurchases, and dividend payments. The current share buyback plan is for 300 Million worth of shares, and at the end of Q3 2023, they have repurchased $216 million worth of shares.

### **Moat Rating: 2/5**

CNX possesses a *narrow* economic moat. While the company benefits from its established asset base, local markets, and operational efficiency, these advantages don't make them insulated against competition for very long periods. They have developed a low-cost production method through their advanced technology; however, such technology can be copied or improved over time.  Their relationships with customers and infrastructure can act as a barrier to entry but may not be robust long-term.

* **Positive factors to moat**:
      * Efficient operational scale and processes lead to low-cost production.
      * Favorable regulatory framework for the natural gas industry.
      * Strong balance sheet.
      * They can create significant volumes of fuel at low prices to their target markets, a good margin of safety.
      * A solid management team that is implementing a successful long-term plan.
*  **Risks to moat**:
      * High volatile natural gas market and prices. They don’t have a lot of pricing power.
      * Competitors can copy many of their technologies.
      * The regulatory risks, where they can have their permits revoked and other issues.
       * Environmental risks to a smaller footprint. 
      * Market share is relatively low, which gives them less pricing power.
      * Reliance on new technology, that may get leapfrogged, or if their technology doesn't perform as expected

### **Balance Sheet Health: 4/5**

CNX's balance sheet is relatively healthy, and there are no serious concerns. They have managed to lower debt significantly over the past few years and have a good capital position. 
 They have a manageable and stable debt and interest burden and their debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio is relatively low compared to others in the industry. This makes their financial structure more flexible and they can respond to market pressures with more confidence.

  *   **Positives**:
      *   Debt is continuously being reduced, and they prioritize lowering debt obligations over others.
       *   Consistent good positive cash flows.
      *    Good liquidity of cash and marketable securities.
       *    Their debt maturity is well-structured, with no significant maturities in short-term.
      *  They have a diverse asset base.
  *  **Risks**:
     * A decline in gas and oil prices will have a significant impact on their revenues, even if their volumes do increase.
      * High reliance on the credit markets. If it is harder or more expensive to borrow, the company's investment plans could be hampered.
      * They have a good amount of debt that will be a burden to service in the event of market downturns. 

{: .important }
**Legitimate Risks:**

*   **Commodity Price Volatility:** The most significant risk to CNX is the volatility of natural gas and oil prices, which can significantly affect their revenue, profitability, and cash flow.
*   **Regulatory and Environmental Risks:** Changes in regulations regarding fracking, pipelines, or greenhouse gas emissions could increase their operating costs and impact their ability to continue production.
*   **Operational Risks:** Drilling, pipeline construction, and other operations entail risks of accidents, mechanical failures, geological problems, and weather-related incidents, which can disrupt operations and increase costs.
*   **Competition:** An increase in competitors within the basin or the emergence of new entrants could put downward pressure on prices and affect profitability.
*   **Economic Conditions:** A recession or other adverse economic conditions could decrease demand for natural gas and reduce prices, affecting the company's bottom line.
*   **Geopolitical Risk:** Global events and political pressures could negatively affect the gas industry and the company's business.

### **Business Resilience**
Despite potential disruptions from external pressures, CNX has shown reasonable resilience by making prudent financial decisions such as having a high credit rating, a good liquidity position, and constantly reducing its debt. The company's emphasis on operational efficiency will also provide them with financial flexibility during market downturns, allowing them to capitalize when other companies fall behind.

### **Understandability: 2/5**

Although the concept of a natural gas company is easily understood, their specific operations and complex financials as well as the high volatility of gas pricing make CNX's financials very difficult to follow. In addition, the amount of detail needed to understand the valuation techniques makes this complex. 

{: .important }

*   **Focus on Free Cash Flow and Deleveraging:** CNX’s management has repeatedly said that the company will prioritize the reduction of debt over production growth.
