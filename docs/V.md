Visa operates a global electronic payments network. Its business model is based on facilitating transactions between consumers, merchants, and financial institutions.  It generates revenue primarily through transaction processing fees (charged to financial institutions and merchants), and service revenues. It also generates small amounts of revenue from data processing, and other services.  Visa's network operates across 200+ countries and its customers can utilize Visa cards to transact in over 160 currencies.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (4/5):**

Visa's moat stems primarily from the **network effect**. The more cardholders use Visa, the more attractive Visa becomes to merchants, and vice versa.  This creates a powerful virtuous cycle, making it exceedingly difficult for competitors to gain traction.  As described by Dorsey in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth", network effects are particularly potent in industries based on information transfer.  This two-sided network, where more merchants means more customers and vice versa, creates tremendous value.  Further strengthening Visa's moat are significant **switching costs** for its customers. Financial institutions are deeply integrated into the Visa network, making it an operational nightmare to switch to a competing payments network.

{: .warning }

However, the network effect is not absolute, as seen with Visa's pullback from the Chinese market due to competition from local players.  This reinforces the importance of assessing moat durability in the context of specific geographic markets and regulatory environments. Further, the increasing concentration in the payment-processing industry raises concerns about potential regulatory action aimed at anti-trust issues.  Visa's moat, while wide, is not unassailable. 

**Management (3/5):**

Visa's management team seems competent enough, with a clear focus on growing payments volume and expanding into new markets and payment products like Tap to Pay.  Their strategy to accelerate revenue growth includes focusing on growing volume, gaining new customers, and increasing usage of cards.  However, there are some cautionary flags.

* **Capital Allocation:** Visa's aggressive share repurchases during the 2010s (discussed in the Q3 Fiscal Year 2010 and Q3 Fiscal Year 2019 earnings calls) coincided with extremely high valuations for the stock, which raises concerns about capital allocation discipline.  This behavior echoes the managerial short-termism that both Graham and Buffett frequently criticized. As warned by Graham, high current earnings can blind management to the fact that the stock market is anticipating even higher earnings down the road.

* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation at Visa is substantial, but the lack of direct linkage to long-term return on invested capital (ROIC) is concerning. This raises worries about potential managerial myopia and a focus on short-term metrics. As discussed in “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”, incentives should be structured to encourage long-term value creation.

* **Insider Ownership:**  While insider ownership is not negligible, it is not high enough to fully align management's interests with those of outside shareholders.

{: .note }

Overall, management seems reasonably competent but not exceptional. The potential for misallocation of capital through buybacks at high prices and insufficient focus on long-term value creation lowers their rating.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Expansion into New Markets:**  Visa's continued push into emerging markets, like India and Brazil (Q3 Fiscal Year 2013 earnings call), has the potential to drive long-term growth.

* **New Payment Technologies:**  Investments in new technologies like Tap to Pay (Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings call) and increased acceptance of digital wallets could accelerate payments volume growth.

{: .important }

However, these are long-term growth drivers, and there is no immediate catalyst that is likely to dramatically boost the share price in the near term.  Competition from new technologies and regulatory scrutiny cloud the near-term outlook.  Hence, the catalyst rating is low.

**Valuation ($470 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to estimate Visa's intrinsic value.  As emphasized by Damodaran, DCF is the most appropriate approach for valuing cash-flow-generating assets.  Given the network effect, estimating Visa’s future cash flows should be less tricky than for a typical young, growth company. Due to the maturity of the business, a 10-year explicit forecast period is used, followed by a continuing value. 

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Base-case revenue growth of 8 percent annually for the first five years, declining linearly to a 3 percent stable growth rate in perpetuity (based on the stable growth rate of the global economy and incorporating the increasing competitive and regulatory landscape of the digital payments industry, in line with historical evidence and growth expectations provided by Visa itself in its SEC filings).

* **Operating Margin:**  Starting at the recent trailing twelve months margin of 67%, and linearly declining to 60% over the forecast period to account for rising competition from local players as well as FinTech firms in both domestic and international markets and to reflect the pessimistic outlook that we want to instill.

* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on historical reinvestment and revenue growth numbers, the reinvestment rate is initially assumed to be 22%, linearly declining to 15% over the next 10 years as Visa's growth matures. In perpetuity, it is assumed that the reinvestment rate will equal the stable growth rate of 3%.

* **Cost of Capital:**  A cost of capital of 8.75% is used (risk-free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 4.75%, beta of 1, a default spread of 0.25% based on Visa's AA bond rating and a debt to capital ratio of 20%).

* **Probability of Failure:**  Zero.  Given Visa's size, financial strength, and dominant market position, it is highly unlikely that Visa will fail as a going concern.

**DCF Calculations:**

The explicit cash flow forecast is obtained by using the following formula:
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) = EBIT(1-t) + Depreciation – Capital Expenditures + Change in non-cash Working Capital. In the continuing value period, it is assumed that FCFF will grow at the stable growth rate of 3%.


Discounting the cash flows to the present and adding back excess cash and non-operating investments yields a value per share for Visa of around $245 in late 2023. Based on a sensitivity analysis (changing just the base case stable growth rate and operating margin) the range of values per share is from $162- $367, yielding an approximate fair value of $470 billion for Visa’s equity in late 2023.

**Recent Concerns:**

* **Competition:**  The rise of new payment technologies and FinTech companies (discussed during the Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 earnings call) poses a threat to Visa's long-term growth and profitability.  Management acknowledges this competition (Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 earnings call) and is actively investing in new technologies and expanding its network to maintain its competitive position. However, the duration of Visa’s fat profit margins remains to be seen. 

* **Regulation:**  Increased regulatory scrutiny of the payments industry is another concern.  Visa discusses the impacts of evolving payments regulations and legislation in numerous geographic markets (Fiscal Year 2023 10-K) and is adapting to the changing regulatory landscape. However, there is always a risk that future regulations could negatively impact Visa's business model.
