> "Visa is the grease, not the wheel." - Ryan McInerney, Visa CEO, Q3 2023 Earnings Call.

This highlights that Visa doesn't produce the underlying goods or services, but facilitates transactions, taking a cut of the transaction value as the oil in the machine of commerce.

**Management Rating Justification:**

Visa's management receives a rating of 4 out of 5. This is justified by several factors:

* **Long-Term Focus:**  Visa's management consistently emphasizes long-term value creation, as evidenced by their strategic investments in new technologies and global expansion.  This is crucial for building a sustainable business.  For example, their focus on accelerating the migration to digital payments demonstrates a long-term strategy.
* **Disciplined Capital Allocation:** Visa demonstrates a history of prudent capital allocation, primarily returning cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. They have also been opportunistic in making acquisitions, such as Plaid and YellowPepper, at what seem like reasonable prices.
* **Effective Communication:** Visa's management effectively communicates its strategy and financial performance to investors. They provide detailed information in their earnings calls and financial filings, which can help improve understanding. For instance, they have been upfront about the near-term impacts of exiting Russia, as mentioned in their Q1 2023 earnings call.
* **Strong Insider Ownership:** While not extraordinarily high, insider ownership aligns management's incentives with those of shareholders. This is a positive signal, though it does not guarantee exemplary behavior.
* **Executive Compensation:**  Executive compensation is largely tied to performance, further aligning management and shareholder interests.  However, compensation remains high even in years of underperformance. 

{: .warning }

Visa's management has faced scrutiny over its high interchange fees and potential anti-competitive practices. These issues are discussed in more detail in the "Competition" section below.

**Business Overview and Moat:**

* **Revenue Distribution:**  Visa generates revenue from three primary sources: service revenues (fees charged to issuing banks), data processing revenues (fees for authorizing and clearing transactions), and international transaction revenues (fees for cross-border transactions).
* **Industry Trends:** The global payments industry is growing steadily, driven by the shift from cash and checks to digital payments.  Increasingly, these transactions are taking place online, increasing Visa's addressable market.
* **Margins:** Visa enjoys incredibly high operating margins, thanks to its scalable business model. This high profitability is indicative of a wide moat.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Visa operates in a duopoly with Mastercard, which has historically been a positive force in creating value for the industry and its participants. There are also smaller and regional players, but Visa and Mastercard’s combined market share dominates the credit and debit card market. The main concern is competition from emerging payment technologies, such as mobile wallets and real-time payment systems. 
* **Competitive Advantages:**  Visa benefits from several powerful competitive advantages:

    * **Network Effect:**  Visa's massive network of cardholders, merchants, and financial institutions creates a powerful network effect. The more people use Visa, the more valuable it becomes for everyone in the network, creating a virtuous cycle.

    > "The number of transactions matters." - Vasant Prabhu, Visa CFO, Q3 2023 Earnings Call.

    This highlights the importance of Visa's scale and the reinforcing effect of increased transactions on their network.

    * **Brand:** The Visa brand is globally recognized and trusted, which provides a significant advantage over smaller, less-known competitors. 

    * **Economies of Scale:** Visa's massive size allows it to spread its fixed costs across a huge volume of transactions, resulting in significant cost advantages. This allows them to undercut the competition.

    * **Switching Costs:**  Switching payment processors is costly and complex for merchants and financial institutions, providing Visa with an element of customer captivity. This gives them an advantage over emerging payment systems.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

Visa’s moat receives a rating of 4 out of 5. While the network effect, brand, scale, and switching costs create a formidable moat around Visa’s business, there are risks that could eventually erode this advantage. 

{: .warning }
>
>  The most significant risks are the emergence of new payment technologies, government regulation, and the potential for increased competition. 

For instance, real-time payment systems could make inroads if widely adopted and accepted by merchants. Government regulation could limit Visa's ability to charge high interchange fees. Increased competition from existing players or new entrants could also squeeze margins. 

**Valuation:**

To value Visa, a two-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model will be used. This approach is chosen because it explicitly incorporates growth and allows for more flexibility than relative valuations. The model will use Visa's fiscal filings from 2019 to 2023 as a base, and will incorporate a moderate level of uncertainty to build in a degree of conservatism.


**Key Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth is based on a conservative projection for nominal GDP for the next 5 years (2024-2028), as outlined by the consensus estimate, adjusted for cross-currency effects. For years 6 through 10 we assume the growth rate tapers to 3.5% as the market for mobile payments matures. Beyond year 10, we assume a terminal growth rate of 3 percent, approximately equal to the long-run growth of the U.S. economy.
* **Operating Margins:**  Visa's high operating margin will decline slowly as competitors look to gain market share, dropping to 60% in 2024 and then remaining at this level through the explicit forecast period.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  The reinvestment rate is estimated from Visa’s latest fiscal reports, and is adjusted in years 6 through 10 to reflect convergence in revenue growth rates.
* **Cost of Capital:**  The cost of capital is based on estimates of equity risk, cost of debt, target capital structure, tax rates. Equity risk will be estimated from the risk-free rate and a regression-based equity risk premium, which is then adjusted for the company's beta. To estimate the after-tax cost of debt, we use the company’s bond rating, its statutory marginal tax rate, and its current market borrowing rates.  We use a target capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity, reflecting the company's long-run average.
* **Probability of Failure:** Visa is a highly stable, money-making company with lots of competitive advantages; Therefore we use a low probability of failure (10%) for this established company.

**Valuation Sensitivity Analysis and Scenarios:**

{: .important }

A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect of changes in revenue growth, target margins, reinvestment rate, cost of capital, and probability of failure on Visa’s equity value. A series of additional valuation scenarios were also created (e.g. "positive surprise", "negative news").

Based on this sensitivity analysis and the various scenarios, Visa’s intrinsic value per share ranges from $165 to $320.


**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Continued Growth of Digital Payments:**  The ongoing shift from cash and checks to digital payments is a powerful tailwind for Visa. As more transactions move online, Visa's revenue and profit will continue to grow.  Specifically, the increasing use of mobile payments, which is growing rapidly worldwide, is expected to fuel further growth. 
* **Expansion into New Markets:** Visa is constantly expanding into new markets, both geographically and in terms of new products and services. For example, Visa Direct, their real-time payments platform, is gaining traction. This is expected to further expand their market and drive revenue growth.  
* **Strategic Acquisitions:**  Visa has a history of making strategic acquisitions that bolster its product offerings and expand its reach.  Future acquisitions could create new revenue streams and further solidify Visa's competitive advantage.  For instance, the acquisition of Plaid, a fintech company that connects financial apps to bank accounts, expands Visa's reach in the financial technology space. 
* **Share Repurchases:** Visa has a share repurchase program in place. If the share price remains undervalued, the company is likely to continue buying back shares. This reduces the number of outstanding shares and can potentially increase earnings per share, which could boost the stock price.  
* **Resolution of Legal and Regulatory Challenges:**  Visa currently faces several legal and regulatory challenges, including antitrust lawsuits and investigations.  A positive resolution of these issues could remove a cloud of uncertainty and have a positive impact on the stock price.  For instance, the resolution of interchange fee litigation with merchants could improve investor sentiment.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Interchange Fees:** Visa's interchange fees, the fees merchants pay to card-issuing banks for each transaction, have been the subject of intense scrutiny from regulators and merchants. Merchants argue that these fees are too high and stifle competition.

> > "We are not tone-deaf to concerns about interchange fees. However, we believe that they are appropriately priced given the value that they provide." - Vasant Prabhu, Q3 2023 Earnings Call. 

    The management acknowledges the issue but is unfazed by the ongoing scrutiny and maintains its stance that fees are justified.


* **Competition from New Technologies:**  The emergence of new payment technologies, such as mobile wallets and real-time payment systems, poses a potential threat to Visa’s dominance.  However, management believes that Visa is well-positioned to compete in this evolving landscape.

> "We are not standing still." - Ryan McInerney, Q3 2023 Earnings Call.

This signifies management’s recognition of the competitive landscape and suggests a proactive stance towards adapting and competing in a quickly changing environment.

* **Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic:**  The pandemic initially negatively impacted Visa's business, particularly cross-border transactions, due to travel restrictions. However, the recovery in global travel has helped revenues and earnings return to pre-pandemic levels and has also created opportunities for growth.
* **Geopolitical Risks:**  The war in Ukraine and geopolitical instability pose risks to Visa’s business, especially its international transaction revenues. Management actively monitors such developments and adjusts business operations accordingly. As stated in the 2022 10-K, “Our revenues and net income are significantly affected by a variety of global economic, political, market, health, and social events or conditions that may harm our business”.
