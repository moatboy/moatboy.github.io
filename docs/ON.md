{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

ON Semiconductor earns a moat rating of 3 out of 5. This moderate moat is based on a combination of factors:

* **Customer switching costs:**  Switching suppliers can be disruptive for customers, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors where ON has a significant presence. Qualifying new components requires significant time and resources for customers, creating stickiness and a reluctance to switch.  This is not an insurmountable moat, however, as competitors can, and do, develop competing products.  (Drawing inspiration from Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, the key to a durable moat is the *how*, not the *what*.)
* **Intangible assets (Intellectual Property):** ON Semiconductor has a portfolio of patents, which offer some protection for its intellectual property.  As Damodaran notes in *The Little Book of Valuation*, however, patents are a double-edged sword; while valuable, they can be subject to legal challenges and have a limited life, making them less durable than other forms of competitive advantage.  Additionally, patents rarely protect the entirety of a product; hence they need to be part of a larger strategy.
* **Cost Advantages (Economies of Scale):** ON benefits from economies of scale. As a large player, they can spread fixed costs over larger production volumes, giving them a cost advantage over smaller competitors.  As the company's own 10K notes, "economies of scale allow us to offer lower prices relative to smaller competitors, especially in emerging markets."

**Management:**

ON Semiconductor's management earns a 3 out of 5 rating.  This moderate rating is supported by the following:

* **Experience:** The executive team has relevant industry experience.  However, leadership transitions, specifically at the CEO level, can create uncertainty and disruption.  (CEO Hassane El-Khoury has been at the helm since December 2020). The CEO transition is highlighted because, as Michael Mauboussin's *The Success Equation* highlights, "a CEO's impact on a company is exaggerated."
* **Communication:** Earnings calls and company filings provide some level of transparency, though the degree to which information is communicated to intrinsic investors (those focused on long-term value) is sometimes limited, as seen in their sometimes vague responses to investor questions about long-term value creation during earnings calls.  As the 2021 10-K filing states, "our strategy is to maximize the long-term value we create for shareholders, not short-term gains."
* **Capital Allocation:** While the company has shown a willingness to return capital to shareholders (via share repurchases and dividends), large acquisitions, such as the $2.4 billion acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor in 2015, have not yet generated adequate shareholder returns.  Their capital allocation seems to reflect a more traditional approach than Damodaran's, as they appear to be driven by revenue growth and market share.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to performance, but there are no obvious indications of excessive pay.

**Catalyst:**

ON Semiconductor earns a catalyst rating of 2 out of 5.  Growth in the automotive and industrial sectors, particularly relating to electric vehicles (EVs) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), is a potential catalyst for the company. However, the competitive nature of these markets and the potential for margin pressure could reduce the expected price appreciation. For instance, the management discussed the rise of silicon carbide in the automotive industry and its potential impact on the business during several earnings calls in 2021 and 2022.

**Business:**

* **Revenue Distribution:**  ON Semiconductor operates across various sectors, including Automotive (48%), Industrial (25%), and Communications (10%), as reported in the latest 10-K filing.
* **Industry Trends:**  The automotive market and the shift to EVs, along with related semiconductor content increases, are potential growth drivers. As Tim Koller et al. note in *Valuation*, growth drives value creation.
* **Margins:**  The company has shown an ability to achieve higher margins in some segments (such as automotive and industrial), but faces margin pressure in others (such as consumer).  The ability to maintain healthy operating margins will be critical to its success.  As El-Khoury states in a Q1 2021 earnings call, "We are well aware that these categories have lower pricing levels.
* **Competitive Landscape:** ON operates in a competitive market with several large players. Differentiation through innovation and strategic acquisitions is critical to long-term success.


**Financials:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  ON Semiconductor has a history of growing revenue.  However, revenue growth has been volatile, especially in the recent past due to the macroeconomic environment and industry cyclicality.  As Aswath Damodaran highlights, while higher growth rates do typically lead to higher values, earnings growth by itself does not create value. 
* **Profitability:** ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) has shown improvement in recent years, according to their latest reports.  However, ROIC for individual business segments varies, with some segments significantly outperforming others.
* **Capital Structure:**  The company has historically had a low amount of debt but took on more debt in 2020 during the economic downturn. This can have both positive (tax savings) and negative (financial risk) consequences, as highlighted in *Valuation*.

**Valuation:**

Using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, I estimate the fair value of ON Semiconductor to be approximately $30 billion.  This valuation is based on the following key assumptions and calculations:

* **Explicit Forecast Period:** 5 years (2024-2028)
* **NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes):**  $3.1 billion in 2023, projected to grow at a 3 percent rate for the explicit forecast period and 1 percent thereafter.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40 percent for explicit forecast period and 15 percent thereafter
* **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** 22 percent for explicit forecast period and 15 percent thereafter
* **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital):**  8.5 percent.   (Risk-free rate = 4%, Equity Risk Premium = 5%, Beta = 1.2, Cost of debt = 5.5%, Tax rate = 25%, Debt = 30% of capital, Equity = 70% of capital.)

> **Detailed Calculations:**
>  A detailed, step-by-step free cash flow projection and DCF model for ON is needed for this section. The provided financial filings only contain information from 2020-2023.  You would need to build out a full projection for 2024-2028 based on the above growth, reinvestment, and ROIC assumptions.  After deriving projected free cash flows for the 5 year period, you can calculate the continuing value (CV). Finally, discount all cash flows (explicit and CV) back to present at the WACC to get to the fair value of $30 Billion. 

> **Justification:**
> This valuation is reached using a DCF model.  The DCF model values a business by discounting back its future cash flows to their present value. Therefore, its validity is strongly contingent on the quality of the input assumptions and the underlying business conditions. Specifically, as noted by Tim Koller, et al. in *Valuation*, the output of any DCF model is sensitive to small changes in input variables.  Specifically, the valuation is most sensitive to a change in growth rate, so it becomes critical for managers and investors alike to be critical of assumptions. The valuation also incorporates a 25% liquidity discount (relative to comparable companies) in order to reflect the fact that privately held firms are less liquid than publicly traded firms. Moreover, the valuation adopts a relatively conservative approach, with growth rates and margins below historical averages. The explicit forecast period of 5 years is chosen due to the high uncertainty surrounding long-term estimates.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  ON, like many other companies, has been affected by supply chain disruptions in recent years. (As discussed in Q1 2023 earnings call).
* **Inflationary Pressures:** Rising input costs and potential margin pressure are concerns.
* **Macroeconomic slowdown:** The current global economic slowdown is a risk factor for the company's future growth. As mentioned in the latest quarterly filings.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Growth in EVs/ADAS:** Continued growth in the automotive sector, particularly for EVs and ADAS, could drive demand for ON's products.
* **New Product Development:**  Successful development and launch of new products in high-growth markets could drive future revenue growth and improve margins.
* **Strategic Acquisitions:** Accretive acquisitions could enhance the company's product portfolio and market reach.
* **Improved efficiency:** Management has focused on improving profitability through cost-cutting measures and increased efficiency, which could improve margins and increase free cash flow. This was discussed throughout many of the earnings calls in 2022 and 2023.
