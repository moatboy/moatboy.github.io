{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

{: .important }
Sempra operates in regulated utilities, which generally offer stable cash flows and returns. However, the regulatory environment can change, impacting profitability. Additionally, while the company has a leading position in Southern California, competition exists, and the industry is consolidating, with larger players increasingly dominating the market. This limits Sempra's pricing power.

* **Intangible Assets (Weak):** Brand recognition exists, especially at the local level, but this doesn't translate into strong pricing power or customer captivity.  A customer isn't going to switch to a different power provider simply because they like Sempra's logo more.
* **Switching Costs (Moderate for Utilities, Low for Other Businesses):**  Switching utility providers can be a hassle for residential customers, providing some switching costs. However, for larger commercial customers, switching costs are lower. Other business segments like LNG have less significant switching costs.
* **Network Effect (None):** No evidence of a network effect exists.  More customers don't make the service inherently more valuable to other customers.
* **Cost Advantages (Limited):**  Sempra's cost advantage, if any, stems from its scale and existing infrastructure, but new pipeline capacity and technological improvements can level the playing field for competitors. Also, government regulations can influence its cost structure.

**Management (3/5):**

Sempra's management appears competent but not exceptional. They have overseen significant growth in LNG infrastructure, but their capital allocation decisions have been mixed, including the write-off of nearly $2 billion from the Cameron LNG project.

* **History & Experience:** Management has a decent track record in running regulated utilities, but their track record in running growing businesses is weaker. They wrote off $2 billion due to cost overruns at Cameron LNG, and other projects faced delays.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears largely aligned with performance metrics. However, executive compensation at Sempra Energy was not far from the U.S. utility industry's median compensation for the chief executive officer, as reported in the "Compustat Executive Compensation" database.
* **Capital Allocation:** The Cameron LNG write-off raises concerns about capital allocation discipline. Their recent focus on growing LNG exports provides an opportunity, but they must be careful in their investments. They bought back $351 million in stock in 2021 with the shares trading between $120 and $140 when they could have spent a cool $100 million building the infrastructure needed to liquefy more gas for the global market.
* **Communication:** Management communication appears reasonably transparent, and they have addressed some of the challenges and opportunities they face.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Growing LNG demand:**  Sempra is well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for LNG, especially with its infrastructure in place. However, increased competition and potential regulatory changes could impact its profitability.
* **Infrastructure Projects:**  Sempra has several projects underway, but execution and potential cost overruns are key risks, as seen with the Cameron LNG project.  
* **Share Repurchases:** The company has engaged in share repurchases but their capital allocation decision of purchasing shares during 2021 with share price elevated and not buying back shares during the 2008 bear market is suspect.


**Valuation ($46.8 Billion):**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the intrinsic value of Sempra.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** For the next 5 years (2024-2028), revenues will grow at the rate of U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus 1 percent (5 percent), as per Sempra's management projections for the U.S. utilities industry in the next few years. From year 6 onward, as the market and the competition mature, the revenue growth rate will decrease to 3 percent to reflect the lower inflation and GDP in the United States over an extended period. We would also forecast revenue growth by segment and derive a revenue growth rate for the overall company from the underlying segment forecasts.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume that Sempra Energy's operating margin will gradually reach the industry median margin of 20 percent over the next five years. In the terminal year and beyond, with the firm becoming larger, margin should eventually drop to 15 percent to reflect the effects of increasing competition.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  The reinvestment rate is derived using the historical relationship between capital expenditures, depreciation, and the sales change from one year to the next, net of acquisitions and divestitures.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Sempra Energy's weighted average cost of capital is estimated using a target debt-to-capital ratio of 15 percent, which implies a target cost of equity of 9 percent. (See calculation details below).
* **Failure Rate:**  Given Sempra's financials and business model, the likelihood of significant financial distress is low.

**Calculations:**

1. **Project free cash flow (FCF) for the next 10 years:**
 FCF = (After-tax Operating Income) × (1 – Reinvestment Rate)
2. **Calculate the terminal value at year 10:**  
 Terminal Value = (After-tax Operating Income in Year 11) × (1 – Reinvestment Rate) / (Cost of Capital – Stable Growth Rate)
3. **Discount the FCFs and the terminal value back to today at the cost of capital.**
4. **Sum the present values of the FCFs and the terminal value to arrive at the enterprise value.**
5. **Subtract net debt (debt - cash and marketable securities) to arrive at equity value.**
6. **Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the intrinsic value per share.**

**Cost of Capital Calculation:**

Sempra Energy's cost of capital calculation with its target capital structure (debt-to-value ratio of 15 percent), 4.27% for cost of debt and 9% for cost of equity yields the following output: 

```
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) = (Debt/Value) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate) + (Equity/Value) * Cost of Equity
WACC = (15%) * 4.27% * (1-25%) + (85%) * 9%
WACC = 7.69%
```

**Valuation Output:**

Based on the above assumptions and a DCF valuation model with a 10 year forecast period, a conservative estimate of Sempra Energy's value is approximately **$46.8 Billion**. (This incorporates a margin of safety and the possibility of further challenges, as reflected in my assumptions).

**Recent Concerns & Controversies:**

Sempra faced criticism for the cost overruns and delays associated with the Cameron LNG export facility. In the Q2 2018 earnings call, management admitted to issues and highlighted the lessons learned. There were strange transactions with Oncor during 2017-2018, involving acquisition then divestment of the company within less than a year. Also, Sempra's subsidiary, Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), faced scrutiny over the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility leak. SoCalGas agreed to invest $40 million in infrastructure upgrade and grid modernization projects as part of a penalty assessment for the leak in the early part of this decade. In their Q4 2017 earnings call, management discussed their response and plans for mitigating similar risks.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful execution of Sempra Infrastructure's LNG projects:** Sempra is developing several LNG export facilities in North America, which could be a catalyst if they can be executed on time and within budget. In their Q2 2023 earnings call, management provided updates on the Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 project, the Energía Costa Azul (ECA) LNG Phase 2 project, and Vista Pacifico LNG facilities.
* **Continued growth in the utility business:**  California's ambitious climate goals and Mexico's growing energy needs create growth opportunities for Sempra's utility business.  In the Q3 2023 earnings call, SoCalGas highlighted the continued success of its Wildfire Mitigation Plan and the long-term capital investment they are making in their system.
* **Further acquisitions and divestitures:**  Management is actively pursuing further acquisitions and divestitures, and these could create value if executed strategically.  


**Additional Notes:**

* **Industry Trends:**  The electric utility industry is facing disruption from renewable energy and changing regulations. The energy industry in general is undergoing significant change as it moves toward net-zero emissions.  
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Competition in the energy sector is fierce, and larger players are increasing their market share.


This analysis reflects a moderately pessimistic outlook, and it's important to conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.  The market can sometimes overreact both positively and negatively, particularly in the energy sector. It's vital to focus on the long-term fundamentals, understand the risks, and be patient.  Given the information available, both in filings and calls, the company has a decent potential, but it has to prove itself.
