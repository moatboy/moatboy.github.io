{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

CHT benefits from being the incumbent and largest player in the Taiwanese telecommunications market. This provides some scale advantages and makes it difficult for smaller competitors to compete. Switching costs for consumers, though not as high as in some other industries, provide a degree of customer stickiness. However, the telecommunications industry is characterized by intense competition and ongoing technological disruption.  

>  I am deducting points for the following reasons:
- The relatively low score recognizes the eroding nature of traditional telecom moats. As technologies converge and competition intensifies, CHT’s advantages are weakening.  The emergence of over-the-top (OTT) players has put pressure on pricing and margins.  This is a global phenomenon, as documented in the Morgan Stanley report, and makes it difficult for any telecom company to maintain supernormal profits for an extended period.
- CHT’s moat is primarily based on scale and incumbency, which are relatively weak competitive advantages. It lacks unique intangible assets (such as valuable patents or strong brands), a key element for stronger moats, as discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

**Management (3/5):**

CHT's management appears competent but not exceptional. The management is quite vocal about their future plans and strategies, and is focusing on maximizing shareholder value, which is the right thing to do. However, their capital allocation decisions haven't been sufficiently value-accretive to justify a higher rating, and their focus on issuing EPS guidance, as highlighted by Aswath Damodaran's "*Lesson 4: Don't trust reported earnings...*" is a red flag.

> Justification for rating:
* **History:** CHT has a long and stable operating history, demonstrating management’s ability to navigate a mature and challenging industry.  However, its track record of creating shareholder value has been inconsistent. Its financials reveal a substantial dip in return on invested capital (ROIC) during the 2008 financial crisis, which illustrates the cyclicality of the industry and a potentially insufficient margin of safety, as discussed in *The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham.
* **Experience:** The current management team appears experienced in telecom operations, but they are relatively new to the demands of a rapidly changing technological environment.  The company's recent forays into new areas, such as cloud computing, have not yet generated exceptional returns.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears to be tied, at least in part, to performance, which incentivizes shareholder value creation. However, the company also grants significant amounts of stock options, as is common among tech companies. This dilutes shareholder value and can incentivize short-term focus on earnings per share (EPS), as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Insider Ownership:** Senior management does own shares in the company but not at levels that would indicate exceptional alignment with shareholders' interests, according to Graham's "*Lesson 15: Does the company have a management of integrity?*" from *Security Analysis*.
* **Communication:** Management provides detailed information in financial reports and earnings calls, facilitating more transparency for investors. However, this is negated by their insistence on issuing EPS guidance and managing EPS by cost-cutting and delaying investments, as Michael Burry mentions in his "*Journal*", a practice Graham and Buffett both strongly discourage.
* **Capital Allocation:** CHT's investments in growth have not yet generated returns that exceed the cost of capital, potentially indicating that management may be overpaying for acquisitions or investing in unprofitable ventures, failing to adhere to the core principles of value creation outlined in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies* by McKinsey & Co. 

**Catalyst (2/5):**

CHT's future success hinges on its ability to successfully transition to a mobile-first business model and to capitalize on growth opportunities in new technologies, such as 5G and cloud computing. The company's recent acquisition of a local cable company in June 2023 could be a catalyst for accelerating growth in the Taiwanese fixed broadband space. However, these initiatives will require significant investment and face intense competition, adding a degree of uncertainty. The 2023 annual report mentions the Taiwanese government approving a major capital expenditure on mobile broadband, and this coupled with strong demand for network infrastructure can give impetus to future investments. However, the highly cyclical nature of the telecom sector should temper any overly optimistic expectations, as highlighted by Damodaran.  The company may need to overcome regulatory resistance to secure a merger,  which it currently considers a critical element of value creation, as described in the 2023 annual report.

**Valuation ($28.8 billion):**

> **Methodology:**  A three-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model was used for valuation, incorporating the company's current strategic plans, existing business performance, and potential risks associated with the competitive landscape and evolving industry dynamics.  A pessimistic outlook was adopted to reflect the company’s mature status, intense competition in the Taiwanese telecommunications industry, and uncertainty surrounding the success of growth initiatives.

> **Key Assumptions:**
* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue growth will come primarily from mobile and fixed broadband, with an annual growth rate in the next few years equal to real GDP growth (2.5%) in Taiwan. As the market reaches saturation, revenue growth decreases to 0.5 percent. The company's 2023 annual report states the industry experienced only slow-to-moderate growth last year, and therefore this assumption seems reasonable.
* **Operating Margin:**  Operating margins are projected to remain relatively stable at around 25%, which is close to the median of its peers in emerging markets, according to valuation guidelines from Damodaran's "*Difficult to value companies...*". Margins are not projected to improve, reflecting the assumption that CHT will struggle to pass increased costs onto consumers amidst intense competition. (This information is from the Q3 2021 earnings call).

* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on the company's historical reinvestment pattern, a reinvestment rate of 31 percent of after-tax operating income has been used, but this will decline in the terminal period to match the stable growth rate of 0.5%.
* **Cost of Capital:**  A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8% has been used, reflecting the company's relatively stable business. This includes a beta of 0.8 and a country risk premium of 4.5% for Taiwan, in line with Damodaran's "*Country Risk Premiums*" for 2012. This remains unchanged throughout the analysis. The company's historical debt to equity is around 35%, so target debt is set at this level.


> **Calculations:**
1. **Explicit Forecast Period (10 years):**  The company's income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow were projected for the next 10 years, using the aforementioned assumptions.
2. **Continuing Value:** The continuing value was estimated using the perpetuity growth formula, which sets the company's WACC at 8% and the terminal growth rate at 0.5%.  
3. **Present Value:** The free cash flows from the explicit forecast period and the continuing value were discounted back to the present at the WACC to arrive at the enterprise value.
4. **Equity Value:**  The value of minority interest (5.829 billion at book value) was added to the enterprise value and excess cash (2.541 billion at book value) was netted out. Debt (16,291 billion at book value), non operating assets (1.116 billion at book value). Number of shares in treasury (0). Options/Warrants Outstanding at book (0). This will decrease during this period, as it has been since year 2000.
5. **Value per Share:**  The equity value was then divided by the number of shares outstanding (3.142 billion) to arrive at a value per share.

> **Results:**  The model resulted in a value per share of $7.40, and a total equity value of $23.288 billion for Chunghwa Telecom. The market capitalization of the company at the time of writing this is around $24.7 Billion. This implies that the stock is currently slightly overvalued.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** CHT generates the bulk of its revenue from mobile services, followed by fixed-line and broadband services. Enterprise solutions and international fixed line are also part of the revenue mix. The 2023 annual report indicates that Mobile Communication revenue has risen by 6.8% over the year, mainly from increased usage and demand for network quality. However, overall revenue has declined. The company expects growth to come from 5G and other newer technologies. As OTT companies become stronger, CHT's market share and pricing power in fixed-line communications will likely continue to decline.  In their Q4 2022 Earnings call the company noted that the market still has not picked up and remains soft.
* **Margins:** Margins in the telecommunications industry are generally stable for incumbents, but they can come under pressure as competition intensifies and as companies invest in new technologies. CHT's margins have declined slightly in recent years, primarily because of intense competition in the broadband and enterprise services markets. The company expects margins to be around 25% going forward, assuming normal market conditions, as stated in their Q3 2022 Earnings Call.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The Taiwanese telecommunications market is highly competitive, with three major players and several smaller competitors. Chunghwa Telecom is the largest player by revenue and market share, but its competitors are aggressively investing in new technologies and services to gain market share. The competition from cable companies for broadband services and from mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)  is particularly intense.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies/Problems:**

* **Declining Revenue and Profitability:**  CHT has been facing headwinds from declining revenues and profitability in its fixed-line and broadband businesses due to increasing competition. This is a long-term challenge that the company is trying to address by focusing on growth in mobile and enterprise solutions.
* **Technological Disruption:** The rapid pace of technological change in the telecommunications industry is a significant challenge for CHT. The company needs to make substantial investments in new technologies, such as 5G and cloud computing, to remain competitive.  These investments may put pressure on margins in the short term.
* **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The telecommunications industry in Taiwan is subject to regulatory scrutiny. This could affect the company's ability to increase prices or to make acquisitions.
* **Government Intervention:** Government intervention can be a double-edged sword. It can provide restrictions for competitors. But it can also force the company to lower prices and reinvest in non-profitable ventures such as cybersecurity, fiber optics network expansion, etc.
* **Currency Risk:** A portion of the company's revenues and costs are denominated in other currencies, which exposes the company to exchange-rate volatility.
* **Political Risk:** Taiwan faces a constant threat of geopolitical tensions, adding more risks and potentially impacting the company's operations.



**Potential Catalysts:**

* **5G Rollout:** The ongoing rollout of 5G services could be a significant growth driver for CHT in the medium to long term.  However, the company needs to make substantial investments in 5G infrastructure to benefit from this opportunity. 
* **Growth in Enterprise Solutions:**  CHT's enterprise solutions business is a high-growth area.  The company could benefit from the increasing demand for cloud computing, cybersecurity, and other enterprise solutions in Taiwan.
* **Expansion into New Markets:** CHT is exploring opportunities to expand into new markets in Southeast Asia and other emerging economies.  These expansions could drive growth in the long term, but they also carry significant risks.
* **Strategic Acquisitions:**  CHT could acquire smaller competitors or complementary businesses to boost its market share or expand its product and service offerings. However, the company needs to ensure that any acquisitions are value-accretive.
* **Cost Reduction:** CHT could improve its profitability by reducing costs.  The company is implementing several cost-cutting initiatives, including reducing its workforce and streamlining its operations.
* **Dividend Increase:** CHT could increase its dividend payout to attract income-seeking investors.  The company has a history of paying a dividend, and a higher dividend payout could make the stock more attractive to investors.
* **Share Repurchases:**  CHT could repurchase its own shares to boost earnings per share.  Share repurchases could increase the stock's value in the short term, but the company needs to ensure that the repurchases are made at a price below the stock's intrinsic value.
* **Favorable Regulatory Changes:** Favorable regulatory changes could boost CHT's profitability or make it easier for the company to make acquisitions.

The company's future will largely depend on the execution of its strategic initiatives, the competitive landscape, and the regulatory environment. While there is potential for growth, investors should adopt a cautious approach and demand a margin of safety given the inherent uncertainties associated with the telecommunications industry and the geopolitical risks.  This should help mitigate future risks when investing in emerging markets as described by Aswath Damodaran.
