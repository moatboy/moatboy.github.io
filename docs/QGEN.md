*For a better idea of their competitors, see item 5 of the 2023 Form 20-F, under "Other Market Participants".*

{: .highlight }
*    The diagnostic industry is very competitive with large and small companies that all provide very similar solutions. To differentiate themselves from these companies, QIAGEN mainly emphasizes improving sample preparation, automation, and data interpretation. The competition in the industry is based on product quality, performance, and cost-effectiveness, rather than by any economic advantage.

#### What Makes QIAGEN Different
*  QIAGEN is known for its **strong focus on molecular diagnostics and innovative technologies.** Unlike many other companies, they are almost exclusively focused on developing technologies and workflows related to molecular analysis, that make them a major partner for many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
*  QIAGEN products are designed to provide comprehensive molecular insights, and allow their customers to find and utilize data in more effective ways. This allows QIAGEN to create products that allow their customers to solve complex real-world problems.
{: .highlight }
*   One of QIAGEN’s differentiating factors is its ability to integrate both automation and data processing using the same devices and workflows. This is crucial for modern biology because modern biology relies on both automated experiments with data analysis to obtain a complete picture. This can improve data quality, reduce costs for customers, and make it easier for researchers to make key decisions quickly.
{: .highlight }
*   QIAGEN provides very specific types of technologies in molecular analysis, which gives them some ability to command a price premium.

### Financials

{: .highlight }
QIAGEN’s financials indicate a very stable and strong business. The company has been growing at a respectable pace, and has high profitability. Below, we'll discuss some key factors that are relevant in the valuation of the company.

*  **Revenue and Net Income**: QIAGEN has consistently grown its revenue over the past several years. Their net sales revenue for 2022 were €2,233.7 million, an increase of 7.6% from the previous year. The company's 2022 net income was €402.6 million, which was slightly down compared to 2021's €511 million because of a decline in COVID-related product demand. However, if we consider pre-pandemic times, the income has grown substantially. These metrics are good indicators of the business' health and show that the company can generate substantial profits in its operations.

{: .note }
*See Item 5 and 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in their latest report (2023 Form 20-F) for revenue, income, and other information.*

*  **ROIC**: QIAGEN has had a relatively high ROIC, usually above 10% (with some variation over time). Their 2022 ROIC was 11.7%, which shows that QIAGEN is relatively profitable and has strong underlying economics. This is important for establishing whether the company has a moat (and the strength of it).
*   **Debt**: QIAGEN has a manageable debt structure. With their total assets of over 7 Billion Euros, they had a Long-Term Debt of roughly 1.2 Billion Euros in 2022, or about 17% of the assets. Their current debt was at about 1.7 Billion euros. They also have good liquidity and flexibility, as they have about €1 Billion in cash at the end of the year, which shows that they have enough capacity to pay off their debts. Their low debt levels will lead to better returns for the company, and will also give them more financial freedom for acquisitions or internal investments.

{: .note }
*See Item 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the latest report for a summary of their debt (2023 Form 20-F).*

*  **Free Cash Flow**: QIAGEN consistently generates strong positive free cash flow. After investments and capital expenditures, they had about 496 million Euros in cash flow. This shows that the company can generate cash consistently over time.

{: .note }
*See Item F-11 in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the latest report for detailed cash flow statements (2023 Form 20-F).*

#### Recent Concerns
*  QIAGEN faced some controversy in recent years regarding their performance in Covid-related sales. Since 2021 revenues from Covid-testing, dropped significantly. This was not unexpected due to governments and people no longer prioritizing tests. The drop did affect overall profitability, however, but also gave them opportunities to focus more on their core non-covid segments.
{: .important }
*   *They have stated that the base revenues (excluding covid) have continued to grow strongly, which reflects positive underlying business trends. However, since that was their primary driver for revenue during the first few years of the pandemic, management is focused on improving other areas of business.*
*  QIAGEN is also subject to regulatory and legal risks. They need approvals from many agencies (such as the FDA and EMA) to sell products, as a result, regulatory uncertainty poses a major risk to the future of the business. The company has to be careful about meeting all regulatory requirements and standards.
*  They are also exposed to some operational risks such as supply chain and cybersecurity risks, which could affect their business and profitability. 

### Moat Rating: 3 / 5

*   **Intangible Assets**: QIAGEN does benefit from intangible assets like brands, patents, and other proprietary technologies. These do provide some advantages over competitors, especially their QIAstat-Dx and NeuMoDx technologies. It’s worth noting that this technology is in constant development and may become antiquated by other companies if they can make better or cheaper tech.
*   **Switching Costs:** The company also benefits from the tight integration of their products with the workflows of hospitals, universities, and pharma companies, which creates high switching costs. These integrations lead to high client retention for QIAGEN products.
*   **Network Effects:** There are weak network effects present due to them owning some market shares in certain segments and offering services that are beneficial to large network corporations, such as pharmaceutical companies and testing facilities, these are unlikely to generate a proper network effect.
*   **Cost Advantages**:  They can command a certain amount of price premium due to their products' high quality and integration within many research and clinical lab facilities. However, they can't always command a higher price than competitors, meaning there is no real cost advantage based on scale and efficiency of the supply-chain (besides the geographical benefits), especially when compared to low cost manufacturers in Asia.
*  **Overall:** While QIAGEN has various moats in a few areas, these aren't as strong or durable as the moats of other companies. That gives us some insight into the quality of the business, but it is not something that is certain for the long-term. Therefore, the moat rating for QIAGEN is 3 out of 5.

### Understandability: 3 / 5

The business is not too complicated to understand. Their main business is related to molecular biology which may be difficult for a non-expert to comprehend. However, their operations consist of mainly developing molecular solutions and instruments for testing. They also have software components to automate the testing procedure and provide data interpretation capabilities. While understanding exactly how their technology functions is difficult, understanding what they do is relatively easy. Hence the understandable score is 3 out of 5.

### Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5

QIAGEN's balance sheet can be classified as healthy. They have more assets than liabilities. Cash flow generation is consistent, and they are able to maintain a good liquidity level with a sizeable cash reserve. The debt structure is very manageable, and they don’t rely too heavily on it for their funding. A solid balance sheet does give investors a great deal of confidence in the company's future prospects. They have good cash and financial liquidity and this helps when faced with economic uncertainty. Their cash flows are also stable, which will help them meet their debt obligations in the future. However, the recent decline in operating profit (mainly due to covid), also increases their risk. They have the capabilities and resources, but might face temporary challenges as the company works to pivot to a new normal. The score of 4 out of 5 reflects these factors.
