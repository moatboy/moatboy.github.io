>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Atmos Energy's moat stems primarily from regulatory protections. Natural gas utilities operate as regional monopolies, owing to the high capital costs of establishing and maintaining distribution pipeline infrastructure. These characteristics constitute a narrow moat, similar to other utilities. However, the regulatory compact that governs the business can change over time, and some regulatory bodies are more activist-oriented than others, creating uncertainty. This uncertainty, and the relatively undifferentiated nature of its services, contribute to a lower moat rating compared to companies with stronger moats like wide-moat companies. The industry is also slowly consolidating, requiring companies such as Atmos to make substantial acquisitions such as Scottish & Newcastle which may affect long-term performance. Hence, a rating of 2 out of 5.

**Management:**

The company is led by John Akers and Chris Forsythe, respectively serving as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Their long tenures within the company are noteworthy, providing continuity in leadership. However, recent financial performance has been less impressive, and the company's stock market returns lagged the S&P 500 index in the period from 2014 to 2023, which raises concerns. Management's communication with shareholders is mostly done through SEC filings, which are factual but provide limited insights into management's longer-term vision and rationale behind its capital allocation decisions, such as the recent acquisition of S&N. More detailed analysis of ROIC and growth would be beneficial for intrinsic investors.  There is no evidence of excessive executive compensation or egregious related-party transactions based on the available data.  Management's consistent dividend increases suggest their focus on shareholder interests, yet buyback activity is less prominent. Insider ownership is not overly high, with the majority of shares held by institutional investors.  Overall, a rating of 3 out of 5 seems appropriate.

**Catalyst:**

Atmos' main source of revenue is delivering natural gas through its pipeline network to end users. The demand for natural gas is primarily a function of its price and the price of substitutes.  Any government interventions to decrease the price of natural gas can constitute a threat to the company's existing business, so does the opposite (when a new regulation or substitute product makes gas unattractive). Given the current interest rate environment, combined with the relatively stable demand for natural gas, near-term upside from changes in natural gas demand seems low. However, as a utility, the company benefits from the ability to pass through cost increases to end users, which may cause some upside on earnings if energy prices rise. There is also room for margin improvement through increased operating efficiency and scale economies arising from the Scottish and Newcastle (S&N) acquisition. The S&N acquisition could improve their ROIC and provide additional value through synergies and scale. The company also has a sizable amount of Goodwill on its balance sheet, the amortization of which creates a tax shield, contributing positively to earnings. Overall, I give Atmos a catalyst rating of 2 out of 5.


**Business:**

Atmos Energy primarily distributes natural gas in eight states. Revenue distribution varies by business segment. However, Texas accounts for a significant portion of the company's earnings, making their performance sensitive to economic developments and regulatory environment in Texas. The industry has low barriers to entry in certain areas, specifically for the regulated distribution of natural gas (given the regional nature of the industry).  Competition also comes from natural gas producers, pipeline companies and marketers of natural gas in the unregulated segment, though regulated distribution is still monopolistic. Margins for gas utilities typically fluctuate as a function of macroeconomic variables.  Over the past years, Atmos has seen modest operating margin growth. However, their earnings have been more volatile, due to the cyclical nature of commodity prices.   In March 2023, the company announced a joint venture with Brookfield Infrastructure to further develop their renewable business, potentially adding value in the long term.

**Financials:**

Atmos' financial statements show steady revenue and net income growth over the past years. The company had operating income of $1.6 billion and net income of $845 million in 2021. The company has minimal financial leverage. In 2022, it had almost zero debt. Over the past decade, the company had ROIC between 6 and 8 percent, a respectable and stable rate of return, albeit lower than many high-ROIC businesses.  The S&N acquisition, however, increased debt levels significantly, with debt as a percentage of invested capital rising from about 0 to 13% in 2010. 

**Valuation:**

{: .warning }

{: .warning }
To estimate Atmos Energy's intrinsic value, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is employed, using enterprise value as the foundation. This choice is justified by the company's reliance on debt financing in recent years.

* **Forecast Period:** 15 years (a reasonable time frame for a company in a stable industry)
* **Terminal Value:**  Computed using the perpetuity growth formula: Terminal Value = (NOPLAT * (1+g)) / (WACC-g) where NOPLAT, WACC, and g respectively denote net operating profit less adjusted taxes, weighted average cost of capital, and nominal growth rate.
* **Discount Rate:** Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) computed as a weighted average of the cost of debt and cost of equity, using market value weights.
    * Cost of Equity: Estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with a modest risk-free rate of 3.5% and an expected market risk premium of 4.5%. A beta for the entire publicly traded sector of 0.8 is used.
    * Cost of Debt:  Assumed to be the yield-to-maturity (YTM) on their outstanding debt. 
* **Growth Rate:**  Revenue growth assumed to be 2% per year over the next five years and 1% thereafter. This reflects a pessimistic outlook for natural gas demand, given growing concerns about the company's core markets becoming increasingly saturated. It also reflects the natural life cycle of a gas utility in a mature market where penetration has slowed down.
* **Margins:** Operating margins are assumed to be stable, with an average of 15 percent over the next five years, improving to 17% thereafter, thanks to expected synergies and cost efficiencies from S&N acquisition.

{: .note }

**Assumptions:** S&N's financial are added to Atmos' assuming the merger took place at the end of 2009. Excess cash is assumed to equal 1 percent of annual revenues.

{: .important }

**Calculations:**
1. Project revenues and operating margins for each year of the forecast period (see Exhibit).
2. Compute NOPLAT for each year using the operating profit margin * Revenues * (1-tax rate), where the tax rate is 35 percent (average for U.S. companies).
3. Forecast net working capital and net fixed assets as percentages of revenues.
4. Calculate free cash flow as NOPLAT + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Net Working Capital.
5. Determine the continuing value at year 15 using NOPLAT, WACC, and perpetual growth rate.
6. Discount the free cash flows and continuing value back to the present using WACC.
7.  Add nonoperating assets such as excess cash and minority interests, and deduct debt and other non-equity claims, to arrive at the estimated value of the company.

The WACC for Atmos Energy is assumed to be 7.6 percent.  Discounting the free cash flows and the continuing value at the WACC leads to an enterprise value of $17.8 billion.

This valuation assumes a perpetually growing perpetuity based on conservative estimates for Atmos Energyâ€™s operating margin and revenue growth which are themselves justified based on historical data, data from the broader industry as well as information about the company's business and financial characteristics.  There's still considerable uncertainty attached to any valuation, particularly in the long term. The results should be considered an approximation. Any changes in growth rate, margins, reinvestment rates, WACC, and risk can greatly affect the valuation. In the recent Investor Relations Earnings Release (Q4 2022),  ATO raised its revenue and earnings guidance.


**Controversies and Concerns:**

In recent years, Atmos Energy has faced scrutiny related to pipeline safety and environmental concerns. There have been instances of pipeline leaks and explosions, as reported in various local news sources.  In the Q1 2023 earnings call, management addressed these concerns, emphasizing their commitment to safety and investment in infrastructure upgrades. While they downplayed the near-term impact of these events on financial results, it is something to consider, particularly given the potential for regulatory backlash and reputational damage.  The company will also have to navigate any future regulatory interventions relating to reducing carbon emissions given that their core business is delivering natural gas to customers.
