Pessimistic value: $140 B

Comcast Corporation, a media and technology conglomerate, holds a dominant position in the US cable and broadband markets. While its size and integrated business model offer some advantages, its moat is narrow and facing challenges, earning a rating of 2 out of 5.  This rating is justified by the increasing competition, cord-cutting trends, and regulatory scrutiny it faces.  As we saw in "Competitive Advantage" in _Valuation_, sustainable competitive advantage—the source of a wide moat—rests on a company’s ability to generate economic profits (ROIC > WACC).  Comcast's ROIC has been declining, suggesting its competitive advantages are weakening.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



Management earns a rating of 2 out of 5 due to concerns over capital allocation decisions, declining profitability, and limited evidence of shareholder value creation through M&A activity. While the company has substantial insider ownership, executive compensation has been high, and communication surrounding key financial metrics (like customer churn) is often opaque.  Comcast seems to prioritize subscriber growth and revenue, potentially at the expense of long-term value creation, as pointed out in _Valuation_. This is particularly dangerous for mature companies, as most of their value should come from existing assets and operations, rather than growth.

Catalyst rating is 2 out of 5. While the recent focus on cost-cutting and potential for share buybacks are mild positives, the headwinds facing the cable business and competitive landscape suggest limited near-term upside catalysts.  The rollout of new services and technological improvements could bring some pleasant surprises, but their impacts are uncertain.  Moreover, broader macroeconomic headwinds could diminish the potential upside of these catalysts.


### Business Overview

Comcast operates through three primary segments: Cable Communications, NBCUniversal, and Sky. 

* **Cable Communications:** This segment provides broadband, video, voice, wireless, and business services primarily to residential customers in the United States.  It is the company's largest and most profitable segment, though its growth has been slowing due to increasing cord-cutting.  The industry's shift to digital streaming is a significant headwind, posing a major challenge to Comcast’s growth trajectory.

* **NBCUniversal:** This segment includes cable networks, broadcast television, filmed entertainment, theme parks, and content and experiences headquarters.  NBCUniversal owns a portfolio of well-known brands, including NBC, Telemundo, Universal Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation.  Its businesses are diverse, creating a more complex valuation challenge.  

* **Sky:**  This segment primarily provides video, broadband, fixed-line telephony, and mobile services to residential customers in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. Sky also owns and operates a direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming service and operates Sky stores. Like NBCUniversal, Sky's financials are affected by diverse business segments.


**Key Business Trends**

{: .warning }

**Cord-Cutting:** The continued rise of streaming services represents a significant threat to Comcast's traditional cable business.  Comcast's management has recognized this threat and discussed its impacts extensively in recent earnings calls (e.g., Q4 2022 Comcast earnings call).  Their strategic response has been to invest in their own streaming service, Peacock, but its success has been mixed.

**Competition:** The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with players like Verizon and AT&T vying for market share.  Comcast is the largest player in the broadband market, but competition is intensifying as these companies expand their fiber-optic networks (Q2 2023 Comcast earnings call).  Consolidation in the industry is also adding complexity, creating larger, more powerful competitors.

**Regulation:**  Comcast faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny, impacting its ability to raise prices and pursue acquisitions.  This has been a recurring theme in its recent history (Comcast Corporation's 2022 10K).  Changes in net neutrality rules or other regulatory interventions could create uncertainty for the company's future profitability.  

**Technological Change:** The rapid pace of technological change necessitates significant ongoing investments in network infrastructure and content creation. This is especially true for Comcast, which owns a television and streaming business. The company makes extensive ongoing investments in these areas.

**Wireless Growth:** Comcast's wireless business has been a bright spot, and management sees significant potential for future growth in this segment (Q1 2023 Comcast earnings call).

### Financial Analysis

Comcast's financials reflect its mature status and the challenges facing its core businesses. While the company generates substantial revenue and cash flow, its growth has been slowing.  Margins have also been under pressure due to competition and rising programming costs.

**Key Financial Metrics (2019-2022)**

| Metric               | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    | 2022    |
|----------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue ($ billions)  | 108.94  | 103.56 | 116.38 | 121.43 |
| Net Income ($ billions)| 13.06  | 10.53  | 14.16 | 12.97  |
| EBITDA ($ billions)  | 34.01  | 33.77 | 37.53 | 40.01 |
| Free Cash Flow ($ billions) | 14.41 | 17.18 | 17.11 | 12.61 |

{: .note }

**Declining Free Cash Flow:** The decline in free cash flow from 2021 to 2022 is a significant concern, particularly given the company’s high capital expenditures. This suggests either declining profitability or increased reinvestment needs, or both.  As Michael Burry reminds us in _The Big Short_, financial statements should be analyzed critically for inconsistencies, since they can reveal hidden challenges.

**Capital Allocation:** Comcast's history of acquisitions has been mixed. While some have been successful, others (like the acquisition of Sky) have led to significant debt and questionable returns.  Management's focus on share repurchases could be seen as a more efficient way to return capital to shareholders, but only if shares are undervalued.

### Valuation

To estimate Comcast's intrinsic value, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is employed using a conservative, pessimistic set of assumptions.  This approach values the company based on its projected future cash flows, discounted back to today at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate.  Since the true value of the company relies on the performance of its core operations, we discount enterprise free cash flows (FCFF).

**Key Valuation Assumptions (2023-2032)**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Based on industry growth rates, competitive dynamics, and management guidance from recent earnings calls, we project revenue growth tapering from 3% in 2023 to a stable growth rate of 2% in perpetuity.

* **Operating Margin:**  We assume margins will improve slightly over the next five years from 20.6% to a normalized level of 21% before reverting to 20.5% due to increasing competition.  Since Comcast’s existing business is mature, margin expansion is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run, as highlighted in _Valuation_.

* **Reinvestment Rate:**  To forecast reinvestment, we use a simplified approach that assumes the amount of reinvestment is a function of sales and invested capital. This simplified approach does a better job of reflecting how companies manage their capital structure during steady growth. We forecast the reinvestment rate to decline over time from 32% to 10% in the terminal year. High growth companies typically have high reinvestment rates, so as Comcast’s growth slows, so should its reinvestment rate, as discussed in _Valuation_.

* **Cost of Capital:** Using the CAPM, a risk-free rate of 4.0%, an equity risk premium of 5.5%, and an unlevered beta based on a comparable sample of US firms of 0.75, we estimate Comcast's cost of equity at 8.1%. The cost of debt, based on trading data and the company’s bond rating, is 4.2%.  Using target weights of 15% debt and 85% equity, we derive a WACC of 7.5%. Since equity and debt values and expected free cash flow are not impacted by capital structure, we use a more conservative, long-term target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity.

* **Terminal Value:**  We assume a perpetual growth rate of 2% and a cost of capital of 7.5% in the terminal year, in conjunction with the earnings in year 10, discounted at a terminal year cost of capital. 

{: .important }

**Conservative Bias:**  These assumptions are deliberately conservative. The low growth rate, modest margin improvement, and relatively high cost of capital reflect the significant challenges facing Comcast.  By being conservative in our assumptions, we are building in a margin of safety, as advocated by Benjamin Graham and emphasized in the _Intelligent Investor_.  This reduces the risk of overpaying for the stock.

**DCF Valuation Summary**

|                                      | Value (Billions) |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Present Value of Free Cash Flow (2023-2032)| $120.45         |
| Terminal Value                          | $49.32         |
| Value of Operating Assets                 | $169.77          |
| + Cash and Marketable Securities          | $4.43         |
| - Debt                                  | $92.18           |
| - Minority Interest                       | $1.12            |
| = Value of Equity                      | $80.90            |


Based on this conservative DCF model, Comcast's intrinsic equity value is approximately $80.90 billion. Divided by the diluted shares outstanding (2.606 billion shares), this translates to a value per share of approximately **$31**.



### Additional Considerations:

**Hidden Value:**  One area of potential hidden value lies in Comcast's ownership of Hulu. Although it is now a fully consolidated subsidiary, there is still some potential for a later monetization, increasing Comcast’s WACC and driving up value.

**Debt burden:** Another concern for Comcast is its significant debt burden, exceeding $92 billion.  Although the company has the cash flow to service this debt, high leverage increases the risk of financial distress, especially if profitability declines, as noted in the chapter on Valuing Financial Services companies in _Valuation_.  The company's management team will therefore need to prioritize debt reduction or carefully allocate additional cash flows from rising profitability in order to decrease its debt burden, otherwise debt could be a drain on value.

**NBCUniversal and Sky valuations:** Given the complexity of these businesses, there is also potential for mismatches between our somewhat-conservative assumptions and future performance. If they do far better, then what? If they do far worse, then what? We have left out the possibility of hidden value that may eventually surface. The true test of a successful financial forecast is, therefore, to constantly look for errors in our original assumptions, rather than stubbornly clinging to previous views. For a look at how valuation forecasts should be evaluated in practice, see the chapter on Forecasting Performance in _Valuation_.



**Conclusion:**

While Comcast's current market price may appear reasonably valued relative to some peers, a conservative, pessimistic DCF model suggests the stock is overvalued at current levels.  The company faces significant headwinds in its core cable business, and management's capital allocation decisions have been mixed.  Given the uncertainties surrounding Comcast's future, a wider margin of safety may be warranted before investing in the stock.
