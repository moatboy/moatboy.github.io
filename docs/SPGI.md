>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

S&P Global operates in four key segments:

1. **Market Intelligence:** Provides data, research, benchmarks, and analytics across a range of industries. This includes the well-known S&P 500 index, and other indices covering various asset classes and geographies. They offer credit ratings (through the legacy S&P business), along with other research, ratings, and evaluations.
2. **Ratings:** Provides credit ratings and research on a wide range of debt instruments and entities. This segment includes the dominant rating agencies, Standard & Poor's, and is the core of S&P Global's business. They have been the leading credit rating agency for several decades, and benefit from the network effects of being embedded in financial markets.
3. **Commodity Insights:** Offers data, price assessments, analytics, and benchmarks primarily for the commodity and energy markets. This includes Platts, a leading provider in this space, acquired in 2000. They leverage market data and analytics, with a strong focus on the physical commodity markets.
4. **Engineering Solutions:** Provides data, analytics, tools, and services for the automotive, aerospace, engineering, and chemical industries, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers, governments, and universities worldwide.  Focus is on generating greater profitability for its customers through engineering efficiency, primarily by reducing costs and increasing productivity.

**Revenue Distribution (2023):**

* **Market Intelligence:** 40%
* **Ratings:** 40%
* **Commodity Insights:** 15%
* **Engineering Solutions:** 5%

**Industry Trends:**

All four industries are growing, albeit at varying rates. The Commodity and Ratings businesses benefit from their deeply embedded nature in financial markets and ingrained role in financial and economic processes, giving them more stability. The Indices business also has strong stability from network effects, however future growth seems to be constrained by regulatory restrictions. Market Intelligence is seeing its growth coming from increased penetration of data into investment decision-making. 

**Margins:**

The company enjoys healthy operating margins across all segments, typically exceeding 30% operating margins. These strong margins are driven by a combination of pricing power and cost advantages resulting from its scale and data and technology driven business models. As seen in Exhibit 7, the firm has historically generated ROIC that is substantially higher than its WACC.

**Moat - In-depth Discussion:**

S&P Global earns a 4 out of 5 moat rating because of a combination of factors working in its favor:

* **Intangible Assets (Brands and Ratings):** The S&P 500 and other indices, as well as S&P's credit ratings, have become entrenched in the financial system. A competing product would be hard-pressed to replace them.  Platts likewise holds a powerful position within commodity markets. The legacy business of issuing credit ratings creates a kind of mini-monopoly.
* **Switching Costs:**  Transitioning away from S&P Global's products, especially in the Ratings and Market Intelligence segments, involves a substantial cost in time, money, and resources for customers. This strengthens customer captivity.
* **Network Effects:** Indices and Platts also benefit from network effects. The more that investors and businesses use S&P Global's data and benchmarks, the more valuable that data becomes to other investors and businesses, strengthening the company's dominance. 

While SPGI possesses some of the hallmarks of a wide-moat company, a more pessimistic outlook warrants a rating of 4:

* **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The ratings business faces increasing regulatory scrutiny, which could potentially limit pricing power and impact growth. For instance, European reforms may result in less differentiation among rating agencies, putting downward pressure on profitability.
* **Competition:** While switching costs are high, competition exists within each of S&P Global's businesses. The company must continuously innovate and develop new products to maintain its edge.

**Valuation - Detailed Calculations:**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value S&P Global, specifically employing the Equity DCF approach.  Since financial services firms primarily return earnings through dividends or repurchases, the use of equity free cash flow is an appropriate and reliable methodology. 

**Assumptions (as of 2023 Data):**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3.5% for the next 5 years, then 2% in perpetuity. (Pessimistic, reflecting mature markets and potential regulatory headwinds).
* **Operating Margin:**  30% (Reflects historical margins and assumes some decline due to competition).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based upon the company's historical and future growth rates and assuming mean reversion for this sector, we set the reinvestment rate for both the growth and the terminal periods equal to roughly 50%. 
* **Tax Rate:**  20% (Approximating effective tax rate)
* **Cost of Equity:**  9% (Assuming risk free rate of 4.5% + Equity Risk Premium of 4.5%, pessimistic given high interest rates).
* **Cost of Debt:** 5.5% (Based on company’s bond yields)
* **Debt/Equity Ratio:** 0.50 (The company’s current leverage seems to be excessive for an economically sensitive business. Based on the median for the Index, we assign a lower value for both the growth period and stable growth period equal to roughly 0.50).


**Calculations:**

* **After-Tax Operating Income (NOPLAT):** $3.494 billion for 2023 (Actual)
* **Reinvestment:** $1.747 billion
* **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** $1.747 billion


* **Terminal Value:** $25.706 billion  (Calculated using the growing perpetuity formula with a perpetuity growth rate of 2% and a return on equity of 5%).
* **Present Value of FCFE (next 10 years):** $13.668 billion


* **Present value of continuing value (in 2024):** $12.038 billion
* **Total Present Value:** $25.706 billion
* **Fair Value of Equity:** $25.706 billion


**Equity Value per Share:** $339.42 (Based upon 75.7 million shares outstanding).

**Reconciliation to Current Price:**

The current market price is around $440. This implies a premium of about 30% over my estimated intrinsic value. Given SPGI's strong market position, there is less room for error in my valuation. Furthermore, based on the history of market corrections, including the recent ones, and economic uncertainty, 30% is too high a margin for safety.  Therefore, based on economic reality and the principle of value investing, the shares seem overvalued today.
