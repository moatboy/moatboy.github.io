{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Sea Limited’s moat rating is a **2 out of 5**. This conservative rating stems from the following observations:

* **Network Effects (Digital Entertainment):** Garena, Sea's digital entertainment arm, benefits from network effects.  Free Fire, their flagship game, has a large and growing user base.  As per Pat Dorsey's book *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, the value of a network increases with the number of users. However, the gaming industry is notorious for its hits and misses, and maintaining this advantage requires continuous innovation and development of new products. The sustainability of Garena's success in the long term is uncertain, as new games and platforms emerge. Further, competition from established gaming companies like Tencent is fierce.  From the 2Q21 earnings call, management addressed questions about new game launches, emphasizing their efforts to enhance the user experience. 

* **Brand and Switching Costs (E-commerce):** Shopee, Sea's e-commerce platform, has established itself as a leader in Southeast Asia and other emerging markets. Its large user base creates some brand loyalty and there are small switching costs associated with the payment and logistics platform Shopee provides. However, e-commerce is becoming increasingly competitive, with global giants like Alibaba vying for market share. The company is prioritizing user growth over profitability, which might pose long-term risks. As per McKinsey’s Valuation book, brand is only a source of competitive advantage when it gives pricing power, and Shopee's current focus is on low prices and discounts to encourage growth. From the 4Q22 earnings call, management commented on Shopee's progress toward profitability, particularly in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.


Sea Limited's competitive advantages are therefore not as wide or durable as those of companies with stronger moats, leading to a lower rating.

**Management:**

Sea Limited’s management receives a rating of **2 out of 5**. This rating reflects several concerns:

* **Capital Allocation:** While the company has historically reinvested heavily for growth, recent losses raise questions about management's capital allocation decisions. Expanding into new businesses such as food delivery and investing in loss-making ventures (as discussed in the 1Q21 earnings call) raise questions about whether management is sufficiently disciplined about return on invested capital. As discussed in the McKinsey’s Valuation book, growth should be valued only when it creates real value.
* **Compensation:** High executive compensation, even in the face of losses (as pointed out in a 2021 news article), raises questions about alignment with shareholder interests. As per Warren Buffet’s shareholder letters in *The Essays of Warren Buffet*, executive compensation should be tied to performance and value creation.
* **Insider Ownership:** While insider ownership exists, it is not at a level that completely removes concerns about shareholder alignment. As per Warren Buffet, managers should think and act like owners.
* **Communication:** The information provided in financial reports and earnings calls could be more detailed and transparent, particularly about the performance of individual business segments and capital allocation decisions. As per Burry’s trades (from the documents provided), a good manager provides detailed information and data about individual business units and investments.

**Catalyst:**

Sea Limited’s catalyst rating is a **3 out of 5**. This rating is based on the following:

* **Path to Profitability:**  Shopee and SeaMoney’s progress toward profitability, as highlighted in multiple earnings calls, could serve as a significant catalyst. Improved financials will reduce the need for raising capital and potentially lead to share buybacks, which could further boost share prices. 
* **Gaming Growth:**  The continued growth of Free Fire, particularly in emerging markets, offers a further potential catalyst. New game launches could also provide upside, though the track record of such launches is highly unpredictable. 
* **Market Sentiment Shift:**  A change in market sentiment toward growth stocks could act as a catalyst. However, this is difficult to predict and not directly related to company performance or strategy.

**Valuation:**

{: .important }

I used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on the company’s 2023 20-F filing, focusing on after-tax operating income for all business units. 


To deal with the inherent uncertainty of valuing a high-growth company, I employed a three-scenario approach with the following assumptions:

* **Base Case (60% probability):**  This case assumes continued growth, though at a slower pace (revenue growth converging to 3%), improving margins, ROIC gradually rising to 12%, and debt ratio remaining around 15%.
* **Upside Case (20% probability):** This case assumes higher revenue growth (4.5%), margins improving further (14%), ROIC rising to 15%, and a lower debt ratio (10%). 
* **Downside Case (20% probability):** This assumes slower revenue growth (2%), difficulty expanding margins (9%), lower ROIC (8%), and a higher debt ratio (20%).

<br/>

**Key Valuation Drivers and Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Based on historical trends and management commentary on growth plans in emerging markets (from various earnings calls), I made conservative assumptions about revenue growth.
* **Margins:** I used a gradual expansion of margins, based on the base case presented by Sea Limited and comparing them with mature peers in their respective segments.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Calculated based on the projected change in revenues from year to year.
* **Return on Capital:**  A conservative estimate given the industry dynamics.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), incorporating a country risk premium to reflect Sea Limited's exposure to emerging markets. I used the simplified approach to compute the cost of capital for Sea.
* **Terminal Value:**  Calculated using the perpetuity growth model, with a conservative long-term growth rate equal to the long-run growth rate of the global economy. I assumed a stable 3% real growth rate plus 2% inflation (based on current data) to be conservative.
* **Probability Weighting:**  Assigned probabilities to each scenario to account for uncertainty.


<br/>

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecasting:** Projected revenues, operating income, taxes, reinvestment, and free cash flow for each scenario over 10 years.


2. **Terminal Value:** Estimated continuing value beyond year 10 for each scenario based on long-term growth assumptions. For Sea Limited, the continuing value is a large portion of Sea’s value, because the present value of near and medium term cash flows is still relatively small. To determine Sea's continuing value, we first forecasted the company's expected net operating profit less adjusted taxes (NOPLAT) for the continuing-value period (2034 to perpetuity) and Sea's expected reinvestment rate for the continuing-value period (2034 to perpetuity). For instance, Sea's NOPLAT16 in the base case is approximately $15 billion, and the reinvestment rate in the base case is approximately 10 percent. 

    Terminal Value = NOPLAT x (1 - Reinvestment Rate) / (Cost of Capital - Stable growth rate)


3. **Present Value:** Discounted the projected free cash flows and terminal value back to the present using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 

4. **Scenario Weighting:**  Weighted the present value of each scenario by its probability of occurrence and summed them to arrive at an overall valuation.

    Probability weighted value of equity = ($21,431 million x 0.6) + ($32,329 million x 0.2) + ($14,070 million x 0.2) = $22,156 million


5. **Value of Non-operating Assets:** Added value from excess cash, marketable securities, and other nonoperating assets, as reported on the balance sheet.

    Value of non-operating assets = $10,215 million (Cash & Marketable Securities).

6. **Fair Value of Equity:** Summed the probability-weighted present value of operations and the value of non-operating assets. 
   
    Enterprise Value = $22,156 million (probability weighted value of equity) + $10,215 million (Cash and Marketable Securities) +  $2,824 million (Other Investments) + $2,197 million (Value of excess pension assets)  = $37,392 million

    Deduct Financial Liabilities = $37,392 million - $4,459 million (Debt) - $8,122 million (Operating Leases) - $990 million (Unfunded Pension Liability) - $1,080 million (Convertible Notes) - $859 million (Other Financial Liabilities) = $22,882 million.



7. **Value per Share:** Divided the fair value of equity by the number of diluted shares outstanding.
   
    Value/share = ($22,882M)/ (1.05 Billion) = $21.8



<br/>

**Business and Financial Overview:**

Sea Limited has multiple revenue streams across its business segments, each with varying degrees of profitability:

* **Digital Entertainment:**  This is currently the most profitable segment, with high margins driven by in-app purchases in Free Fire. However, revenue growth is slowing due to increased competition and market maturity, as noted in the 2Q23 earnings call. The decline in bookings is a concern expressed by management in the 2Q23 earnings call, though management also expressed optimism about several new features introduced into the game.
* **E-commerce:**  Shopee is still loss-making despite rapid growth in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), primarily due to its emphasis on growth and gaining market share via low prices and promotions, as discussed in multiple earnings calls. The company is facing increasing competitive intensity from local and global players in its key markets. In the 1Q23 earnings call, management stated that their focus for the year would be driving cost efficiencies across all of Sea's business units and that their strategy for Shopee would be optimizing costs and achieving positive adjusted EBITDA.
* **Digital Financial Services:** SeaMoney is showing strong growth and progressing towards profitability, with increasing payment volumes and loan balances. Competition in the sector is intensifying. As expressed in Sea Limited's annual report, improving monetization efficiency for SeaMoney would be a focus in 2021.

{: .warning }

Overall, the company's financials show a company with significant debt and negative free cash flow. Although Sea Limited’s quarterly results improved during the pandemic as discussed in several earnings calls (1Q21, 2Q21, 3Q21 and 4Q21), financial conditions have worsened since then. While revenue growth remains impressive, the company's margins have yet to expand to levels that justify its valuation based on the company’s historical operating results.


<br/>


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Slowing Growth and Losses:** As growth in Sea's core markets decelerates, investors have become increasingly concerned about the company's widening losses. The management addressed these concerns in the 4Q22 earnings call, emphasizing their focus on achieving self-sufficiency for Free Fire, and on optimizing adjusted EBITDA for Shopee.

* **Increased Competition:** The rise of strong competitors, such as TikTok in short video and Alibaba in e-commerce, is putting pressure on Sea’s margins and growth. The management team recognizes this increased competition and has responded with a greater focus on operational efficiency, as highlighted in the 4Q22 earnings call.



**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Continued progress toward profitability** for Shopee and SeaMoney, particularly in Southeast Asia and Taiwan.
* **Successful new game launches** or expansion of the Free Fire franchise in the Digital Entertainment segment. Management announced they are committed to introducing new and engaging features, characters and enhancements to build their player base as they revealed in their first quarter 2021 results earnings call.
* **Strategic partnerships or acquisitions** that could expand Sea's reach or improve its competitive position. As they discussed in their fourth quarter 2022 results earnings call, they are continuing to explore additional business and partnership opportunities. They are always open to new investments, as stated in the fourth quarter 2021 results earnings call. 
* **A broader market rotation back toward growth stocks**, though this is outside the company's control. 


Given the high growth potential and existing competitive landscape, Sea Limited seems to be a risky investment with only moderate upside potential from an intrinsic valuation standpoint.
