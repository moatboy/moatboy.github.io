>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Snowflake benefits from some switching costs stemming from tight integration of its platform in customer workflows but has limited pricing power since its product offerings can be adequately or even easily replicated by competitors. This explains why, despite operating in a high-growth market, it does not post substantial operating profit margins.
Snowflake claims to benefit from network effects given that its product improves as more users join. But is unclear how these supposed benefits are translating into pricing power or higher ROIC and profit margins. 
It can also be argued that Snowflake benefits from economies of scale since the company's revenues are largely based on data consumption. However, research has shown that although network effects are relevant for digital platform businesses, economies of scale, in this case, might be mostly local or regional and not at the broader scale of its total addressable market (TAM).

**Management (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:** Frank Slootman became CEO in April 2019 and has a solid reputation as a technology executive. The rest of the C-suite also possesses relevant backgrounds and experience. They also seem to have a realistic and long-term vision for the company as indicated in the S-1 filing and successive earnings calls, such as for instance when Slootman mentioned during the Q3 2020 earnings call: "And we're in this for the long term. This is not a quarter-to-quarter or even a year-to-year thing. This is a very, very long game."
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is very high—far in excess of what their performance seems to justify. This is partially mitigated by their use of stock-based compensation.
* **Communication:** Although SNOW does communicate quarterly and annual results, their long-term outlook regarding financials is typically high level. Investors want to see a company's annual reports, and in particular its management commentary, as a great place to see the dynamics of management's mind. However, Snowflake does not give detailed discussions of its strategy.
* **Capital Allocation:** Snowflake has poured a significant amount of its money into acquisitions with mixed results. However, Snowflake has a relatively resilient business model as indicated for instance when Slootman mentioned during the Q3 2021 earnings call: "So overall, we're actually feeling very good about our competitive position."

**Business:**

* **Product/Service:** Snowflake offers a cloud-based Data Cloud, providing data storage, processing, and analytical solutions for businesses. The platform is scalable, secure, and supports multiple data formats.
* **Revenues:** The company's revenues primarily stem from product revenues, which are based on the amount of data consumed by clients as well as subscription fees. Product revenue grew by 69% year over year in 2022 and accounts for around 97% of total revenues. Professional services revenue represents the remaining 3% and has been decreasing over the years.
{: .note }

As of November 2020, the company had over 4500 customers, including 146 of the 2020 Fortune 500.
* **Trends/Competitive Landscape:** The data industry is experiencing significant growth, fueled by cloud adoption and increased demand for data analytics. However, this is a highly competitive industry. Key competitors include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). As mentioned in its S-1 filling, Snowflake's Data Cloud is specifically built for the cloud—in contrast to its competitors, which offer cloud solutions as an add-on to their previously built on-premise data solutions. This difference may provide Snowflake with a unique, long-run advantage.
{: .important }

The company acknowledges that it is a very competitive landscape, as mentioned in SNOW's Q3 2020 earnings call:"You're playing in a very, very crowded environment right now and it will become more crowded over time."
* **Margins:**  Currently, gross profit margin is at approximately 66%, R&D spending around 45% of revenues, and operating margin around -3%. Competition will likely put pressure on pricing and hence on margins. This explains why the company's high-growth rate is not translating into profitability. This also explains why, as growth slows down, the market expects margins to improve, and ROIC should move higher as well. However, this expectation might be too optimistic.
* **Financials:** Snowflake's revenues have grown dramatically, from $265 million in FY 2019 to $1.2 billion in FY 2023. The company currently has negative earnings and free cash flow, but it has a large cash balance of around $3.8 billion at the end of FY 2023. Net retention is also around 165%.

**Valuation ($48.8 Billion):**

The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with probability-weighted scenarios (business-as-usual, aggressive scenario, and downturn). 

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:** 15% for the next 5 years, 6% in perpetuity (based on consensus estimates, SNOW's relative size in a growing market, and projected revenue growth of the Global Cloud Computing market.
* **Operating margin:** 25% in perpetuity (based on similar mature software companies and historical margins of SNOW).
* **Tax rate:** 20% (based on Snowflake's statutory rate).
* **Reinvestment rate:**  40% for next 5 years, 10% in perpetuity (based on historical analysis and growth trajectory).
* **Cost of capital:** 10% (based on SNOW's risk-free rate, unlevered beta of software sector, and current market risk premium), equity risk premium of 4.5%, and marginal tax rate of 30%.
* **Probability of scenarios:** 70% for business-as-usual, 20% for the aggressive scenario, and 10% for the downturn scenario (reflects a pessimistic and cautious outlook for the company).

**Calculations:**

The full detailed calculations, including forecasts of revenues, EBIT, net income, free cash flow (FCF), and invested capital for the next 10 years are presented in the tables below. Note that a larger table would be needed for a longer forecast period, but this valuation model can be simplified further, by using only three years of projections before switching to the terminal value. Given these assumptions, the value of operations in the business-as-usual scenario is $45.4 billion. The table below summarizes the value for other scenarios as well.

| Scenario    | Value of Operations ($ billions) | Value of Operations per Share |
| :---------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
| Base Case      | $45.4                           | $126.7                        |
| Aggressive     | $75.9                           | $212.0                        |
| Downturn      | $22.8                           | $63.7                        |
| Weighted Avg | $48.8                            | $136.4                        |

* **Nonoperating assets:**  Snowflake has marketable securities of around $3.8 billion as of the end of FY 2023. These will be added to the value of operations for our final valuation calculation.
* **Value of equity:** $45.4 billion (value of operating assets) + $3.8 billion (nonoperating assets) = $49.2 billion.
* **Value per share:**  $49.2 billion / 0.985 billion shares = $50/share.

{: .warning }

The above valuation excludes the option value that comes from being able to offer new products and to continue to expand into more geographic locations. This is a particularly relevant point for young companies with potentially high growth. A higher value might be justified. But we have chosen to ignore this possibility in this valuation.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **New products:** Snowflake continues to introduce new products or improve current ones and to increase investments in acquisitions in order to expand its reach and functionality. One significant initiative is the expansion of its platform to handle structured data and other data types and products. 
* **International expansion:** The company is expanding its international footprint to address its long-term global growth ambition.
* **Continued growth of the data and AI market:** The market growth has been a significant catalyst for Snowflake. According to its S-1 filing, data storage, cloud spending and the use of cloud-based data and analytics services is expected to increase significantly.


**Concerns:**

* **Competition:** The cloud-data-platform industry is very competitive, with major players like AWS, Azure, and GCP. It is unclear whether Snowflake will be able to develop a sustainable moat as the market matures.
* **Profitability:**  Despite its impressive revenue growth, Snowflake is still unprofitable. Investors are concerned about its path to profitability.
* **Valuation:**  Snowflake's valuation is very high. As the valuation books warn, high-growth, unprofitable companies are especially risky, and a significant drop in share price can ensue if growth or profit margins are lower than market expectations. For instance, when Snowflake reported its Q4 2023 earnings, its share price plunged more than 16% because revenue growth forecasts were lower than what Wall Street wanted, as mentioned in its Q4 2023 earnings call: "Shares fell as much as 16.7%... after the data-warehouse company’s revenue growth forecast came in below what Wall Street wanted."


**Recent Controversy:**

There has been some discussion about Snowflakes's practice of intermingling revenue from other providers when reporting its product revenue. This practice, although technically correct, makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the company's profitability, a fact noted by analysts after its Q3 2022 earnings call: "Snowflake's accounting of other providers’ revenue makes analysis of gross margins and revenue recognition more difficult."

**Conclusion:**

Snowflake is a high-growth company operating in a rapidly expanding market. Although it benefits from some switching costs and has a visionary management team, its lack of pricing power, negative profitability, and very rich valuation warrant a cautious outlook. Consequently, the prudent investor would be well advised to take a pass on Snowflake’s IPO, given the virtual certainty that a few years from now the company’s annualized returns will be far less impressive, and its valuation several times lower.
