Pessimistic value: $43.5 B

Alcon, spun off from Novartis in 2019, operates in the eye-care industry, specifically in surgical and vision care. While the company boasts a strong brand portfolio and global presence, a close examination of its financials and competitive landscape reveals a narrow moat and some concerns regarding management's capital allocation decisions and long-term vision.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Alcon benefits primarily from its intangible assets, particularly its brand name. It holds the number one position in the global surgical equipment market, and the industry is dominated by two other large players (Johnson & Johnson and Carl Zeiss Meditec). 

However, pricing power derived from the Alcon brand appears limited, particularly in vision care, a segment characterized by intense competition and low switching costs.  Alcon acknowledged in its Q4 2022 call that inflation had "eased" in most categories, but there were lingering supply chain challenges in other categories, particularly in equipment, which negatively impacted their net margin. Alcon's gross margin (30% of net sales for 2022) in the U.S. vision care segment, where they have 43% market share, is in line with those of its competitors, such as Bausch Health, CooperVision and Johnson & Johnson Vision Care. This indicates that Alcon is not significantly better than its competitors. The network effect seems limited to their surgical business, which is a closed network. Other areas such as switching costs and cost advantages appear minimal.

>Alcon acknowledged in its Q4 2022 call that one of the key challenges in the industry now is that "the world over, central bankers are in the process of engineering a recession. The central banks collectively have concluded, correctly or otherwise, that the way out of an inflationary spiral is higher short-term interest rates, which will, in turn, negatively affect the economy. And this makes sense, because the financial markets and the broader economy are extremely sensitive to higher interest rates."


**Management (3/5):**

Alcon's management team has a blend of industry experience and financial expertise.  CEO David Endicott has experience in medical device companies, and other executives have experience at large corporations. However, there are some concerns.

* **Capital Allocation:** Management's decision to repurchase $250 million in shares in the fourth quarter of 2022 seems questionable, given the high valuation levels at the time. The purchase of $90 million in Aerie shares in 2021 also turned out to be a poor decision. These share buybacks could have been more value accretive.

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation at Alcon is significant, with the CEO's total compensation totaling over $11 million in 2022. This raises questions about whether pay is tied closely enough to performance. Alcon's proxy statement notes that the compensation paid to the CEO is above their peers and it is justified due to performance and other factors. The compensation is a mix of fixed and variable components and also incorporates incentives from long-term goals.

* **Insider Ownership:** Alcon's proxy reveals moderate insider ownership, with the CEO owning 158,529 shares (0.02% of the total outstanding) as of March 15, 2023. This level of ownership is not high enough to fully align management's interests with those of outside shareholders.

* **Communication:** Management's communication with investors is a mixed bag. While they provide detailed financial reports, their long-term strategic vision appears somewhat nebulous. In the Q3 2023 conference call, Alcon stated that it has increased its share in the global surgical equipment market by 12 percentage points since the company's initial public offering. However, management needs to better communicate its long-term goals and how Alcon will be able to continue to capture market share.

{: .warning }

>Alcon's Q1 2023 annual report includes the following statement: "Despite the recent downturn in the stock market, or possibly because of it, we have not gotten requests from bankers to come in and start structuring CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) ... however, many hedge fund managers would probably be all for this." This kind of thinking is dangerous and raises questions about Alcon's long-term focus.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

Alcon has a few potential catalysts for share price appreciation, including:

* **ARGOS U.S. Commercialization:** Alcon's next-generation phacoemulsification system has received FDA approval and is expected to contribute to revenue growth, although its market share potential remains uncertain. Management provided an update on the commercial rollout of the ARGOS U.S. phaco system in the Q2 2023 conference call: "We expect to continue steady-state phaco system share gain over time, with more hospitals seeking to build out more operating rooms as the backlog of surgical procedures decreases. However, there could be a near-term lull in conversions as the initial wave of early adopters subsides." The management did not quantify the potential revenue from conversions.

* **International Expansion:** Alcon is focusing on capturing share in faster-growing overseas markets. Its continued expansion into emerging markets holds the potential to boost revenues, but also carries significant risks.

* **New Product Launches:** Alcon's pipeline of new products and services holds the potential for future growth. But success is far from certain and will depend on effective R&D, timely product launches, and the competitive response.

However, the lack of specific guidance from management about the timing and potential financial impact of these catalysts makes it difficult to assess their true potential.

**Valuation ($43.5 Billion):**

To estimate Alcon's intrinsic value, we employed a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using a combination of intrinsic and relative valuation methods.

* **Revenue Growth:** We forecast organic sales growth in line with the median growth rate for consumer products companies in recent years. We assume 2% revenue growth for years 1-5 and 1% real sales growth thereafter for the next 10 years (until the firm becomes a mature firm), and then we assume 0% growth.

* **Margins:** We assume some margin improvement over the next few years as Alcon improves efficiency and reduces costs. In its 2022 annual report, Alcon notes that it has successfully reduced its operating cost through a transformation program. Its cost of sales (which makes up 70% of total costs) has gone down to 23% of its net revenue, while selling, general and administrative costs have been reduced to 14% of its net revenue. We expect a 25% operating margin (EBIT/Sales) by year 10, which then declines linearly to 22% (the median operating margin of consumer-staple companies) over the next 20 years and stabilizes at 22% thereafter. 

* **Reinvestment:** We estimate the reinvestment rate based on the change in sales relative to the change in invested capital each year. This is how we compute reinvestment rates for the forecast and stable growth periods. We estimate a reinvestment rate of 10% in perpetuity.

* **Cost of Capital:** We use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%. This is based on a target capital structure, the risk-free rate (derived from US government bond yields), market risk premium, and Alcon's beta, adjusted for financial and operating leverage. The cost of equity is 9.00%. Note that while we acknowledge that we need to be cautious about the recent drop in the risk premium, we have not reduced the risk premium in our model, causing our WACC estimates to be very conservative. Also, we are not adding an additional country risk premium to the cost of equity or cost of capital because our approach assumes that country risk is already captured by local macroeconomic assumptions.

* **Terminal Value:** We assume a terminal growth rate of 1% (in real terms),  the long-term growth rate for GDP in developed economies.

> The model assumes no share repurchases and no new share issuance. This approach is consistent with the valuation models used in the books and is based on the belief that the market price reflects an assessment of a company based on the totality of its cash flows and fundamentals. This approach is simpler and easier to use than some of the more complex approaches, such as the Black-Scholes model, which introduces unnecessary parameters and the potential for distortions in equity values. 


**Financial Forecast (Millions of USD):**

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | Reinvestment | FCF | Cost of Capital | PV of FCF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $8,555 | -$856 | $0 | -$856 | 8.50% | -$792 |
| 2 | $9,206 | -$428 | $0 | -$428 | 8.50% | -$365 |
| 3 | $9,897 | $429 | $0 | $429 | 8.50% | $326 |
| 4 | $10,632 | $944 | $884 | $60 | 8.25% | $45 |
| 5 | $11,416 | $1,534 | $1,466 | $68 | 8.25% | $48 |
| Terminal Year | $49,316 | $4,135 | $4,087 | $48 | 7.56% | $3,527 |
| **Value of Operations** |  |  |  |  |  | $3,113 |


Applying this methodology and these assumptions gives an intrinsic enterprise value of $31.13 billion for Alcon. Adding the firm's cash and subtracting debt leads to an equity value of $8.872 billion, or $20.60/share based on 426.07 million shares outstanding as of 2023. The discounted terminal value is $28.02 billion.

Using relative valuation, comparing EV/EBIT for a peer group of large-cap diversified health care companies like Abbott, Johnson & Johnson, and ThermoFisher, produces a similar value (EV/EBIT is around 16 for all these companies, even after accounting for differences in financial leverage, debt levels, profitability, etc.).

> The company has a significant market cap, so we do not assign any additional discount for illiquidity.


**Conclusion:**

Alcon is a stable, growing company in a large and important industry. Its dominant position in the surgical equipment market and its leading brands give it a narrow moat.  However, competitive pressures in the vision care business, management's inconsistent capital allocation decisions, and moderately high valuation reduce the margin of safety. There may be some room for the price to go lower.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

Alcon might be preparing an investor road show to highlight the strengths of the recently released presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses (PC-IOLs), based on remarks made in the Q2 2023 conference call: "We are also significantly increasing the level of educational programs and congress attendance, as the vast majority of U.S. cataract surgeons now seem to recognize that PC-IOLs are indeed a better solution for presbyopia than more traditional approaches." This could have a positive impact in the short-term, but the long-term implications are uncertain.

In 2023, Alcon acquired two pharmaceutical and medical device companies: Aerie and Pharmanav. These acquisitions may accelerate Alcon's entrance into two adjacent markets: surgical glaucoma products and retinal surgery. They may, however, require significant additional investments over a longer period.


Given these factors, we assign Alcon a catalyst rating of 2/5. 


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

Alcon has faced supply chain issues in the Surgical segment, along with pricing pressure in its Vision Care segment. These problems have eased somewhat in recent quarters but could resurface, impacting Alcon's profitability. On the Q3 2023 earnings call, Alcon discussed the impact of the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia as a persistent global risk, stating, "we do see now new supply dynamics impacting certain of our product areas. So, for our phacoemulsification systems in India, Russia, and the rest of the world excluding China, we're seeing some pretty significant price increases, and in all cases we're implementing those price increases. So, that has improved our market share in the cataract space." This could continue to put downward pressure on the company's margins.

This analysis has been conducted using a pessimistic and skeptical lens, as recommended in the prompt, and with heavy reliance on financial fundamentals and historical performance, as recommended by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. While Alcon may look like a reasonable investment based on its current financials and potential catalysts, the analysis suggests that the current valuation already reflects these factors, and there is limited margin of safety at the current price.
