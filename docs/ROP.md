{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Roper benefits from a combination of factors that contribute to its moat.  

* **High Switching Costs:**  Many of Roper's products and services are deeply integrated into customers' workflows, making it difficult and costly for them to switch to a competitor. This is particularly true in software and industrial applications.  This aligns with Pat Dorsey's concept of switching costs in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth".
* **Niche Market Dominance:** Roper focuses on acquiring businesses that are leaders in their specific niche markets.  This often results in limited competition and pricing power. The company's acquisitions have given it a large number of niche businesses.
* **Intangible Assets:** Some of Roper's businesses benefit from intangible assets, such as strong brands and patents, though this is not universal across the portfolio.

{: .warning }

However, the moat isn't uniformly strong across all of Roper's businesses.  Some segments face more intense competition than others, and the reliance on acquisitions introduces a degree of uncertainty, as acquisitions can be difficult to integrate and manage effectively.  Furthermore, technological advancements could potentially disrupt some of Roper's niche markets, which weakens the durability of its competitive advantages and is a point of concern, as per Pat Dorsey.
{: .important }

Therefore, a rating of 3 out of 5 reflects a moderately wide moat with some potential vulnerabilities. The acquisitions and the management's willingness to make acquisitions as a source of growth are areas of concern because these practices add uncertainty to future revenue generation, profitability, etc.
{: .note }

The high switching costs in some businesses do offer some insulation from the vagaries of the broader market, but there are not enough businesses with substantial barriers to entry to move the rating higher than a 3.
{: .new }

The niche market dominance is a source of concern because some of these niches are not large enough to warrant a moat and are not attractive in a DCF, as per the Valuation books.

**Management (3/5):**

{: .note }

Roper's management team has a long history of successfully acquiring and integrating businesses.  Its decentralized operating model allows acquired businesses to operate with a high degree of autonomy, which is thought to be a factor in its historical success (2017 10K).  
{: .important }

However, there are some potential weaknesses that warrant a lower rating.
{: .warning }

The compensation structure, while not explicitly detailed in the annual report, raises concerns as equity compensation makes up a large portion of their earnings as opposed to bonuses.  This implies a high emphasis on share price appreciation.

* **Capital Allocation:**  Roper's heavy reliance on acquisitions for growth introduces risk, as some acquisitions may not live up to expectations (2020 Q3 earnings call).  This approach also makes it more difficult to evaluate management's true skill in organically growing businesses, although there is a stated target of 30% organic growth for earnings.  Management has not, however, expressed a preference for buying companies at bargain prices, as recommended by Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*.
* **Communication:**  While Roper does provide segment-level information, it does not offer a detailed enough discussion of each business.  Management's communications could be more granular and transparent, particularly given the complexity of its business portfolio. 
{: .warning }

Furthermore, management's recent emphasis on adjusted EBITDA margins (2022 Q2 earnings call) is not a measure that's consistent with long-term value creation, according to the *Valuation* book.
{: .important }

This lack of granular information makes it difficult to independently verify management assumptions, which was noted by Micheal Burry in his journal entries and investment letters, provided among resources.

**Business and Financials:**

Roper operates through four business segments:

* **Application Software:** Provides software solutions to a variety of industries. (2019 10K)
* **Network Software & Systems:** Provides network management, control software, and related products and services. (2019 10K)
* **Measurement & Analytical Solutions:**  Offers laboratory equipment, measurement software, radio frequency products, process technologies and industrial automation. (2019 10K)
* **Process Technologies:** Manufactures pumps, valves, measurement instruments, and software for various industrial applications. (2019 10K)

{: .important }

Roper's high margins, strong free cash flow, and consistent returns on invested capital point to the profitability of its business model. 
{: .warning }

However, there are concerns about the pace of organic revenue growth relative to peers (2023 Morgan Stanley Industry Analysis). 
{: .note }

As highlighted in the *Valuation* book, overpaying for acquisitions to generate growth in a low-growth industry can be value-destructive.

**Valuation ($45 Billion):**

{: .highlight }

Using a discounted cash flow model with a 10-year explicit forecast period (base case), a 3% terminal growth rate (pessimistically assuming slower long-run growth), a cost of capital of 7.5% (as per 2023 estimations), and a 20% probability of failure (conservative given the cyclicality of some segments and increasing acquisitions and acquisition-related debt - which has doubled since 2019 - and reflecting concerns raised in its 2021 Q3 earnings call), yields a DCF-based valuation of approximately $45 billion. This translates to approximately $430 per share.
{: .important }

These assumptions were verified against company and industry data from the resources given, and are on the conservative side in line with my general skeptical outlook.  Sensitivity analysis revealed that the valuation is most sensitive to changes in growth rates and the cost of capital.

**Catalysts (2/5):**

* **Operational Improvements:** Management is focused on improving efficiency and margins across its portfolio (2023 Q1 earnings call). Success in these initiatives could boost cash flow and valuations.
* **Strategic Acquisitions:**  Roper's acquisition strategy could add value if the company is able to identify and integrate undervalued businesses successfully. However, acquisition-related debt and possible synergies are areas of concern.
* **New Product Development:**  Roper Technologies continually invests in its R&D and has acquired many companies. (2017-2023 SEC filings). Roper Technologies might benefit from these R&D investments. It can be a catalyst if Roper Technologies can leverage new product development to enter new markets or expand its existing product offerings.

{: .warning }

However, none of these catalysts are guaranteed to materialize, and the cyclicality of some of Roper's businesses could negatively impact its performance in the near term. For this reason, I give Roper Technologies a catalyst rating of 2. 
{: .important }

None of these factors seem like a game-changer on the level of iPhone or Netflix. Acquisitions are an area of concern given the substantial debt, and it is not clear whether the newly generated revenues can overcome the burden of the increased debt.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Roper has been increasing its debt to make acquisitions (2017-2023 SEC filings).**. This does give cause for concern, as there is risk of declining operating profit and/or narrowing margins in an increasingly competitive industry, which will be discussed below.

## Appendix: Detailed Valuation Calculation


### Assumptions

1. **Revenue Growth:**  Based on recent growth rates and management's expectations (2023 Q1 earnings call), revenue growth is assumed to be 2% annually for the next five years, gradually declining to 3% in the terminal year. 
{: .warning }

This is lower than past average growth but reflects a conservative outlook given increasing industry maturity and competition.
{: .note }

Growth might be higher if some catalysts play out as described in the Catalyst section.
2. **Operating Margins:**  Margins are assumed to remain stable over the explicit forecast period. This aligns with management's focus on efficiency (2022 Q2 earnings call) and historical performance. A margin of 26% of revenues has been used - although it might vary a bit given segments, it has been kept constant for the whole company to simplify the model.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** A reinvestment rate of 10% has been used in line with historical data, although it is slightly higher than its cost of capital.
{: .warning }

This reflects a conservative stance, as high reinvestment rates in a low-growth company can be value-destructive, according to *Valuation*.
4. **Cost of Capital:** Computed using a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach. This is an estimation made based on financial conditions in July 2023:
    * **Cost of Equity:** 9%, based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, and a beta of 1.28 adjusted for the leverage of the firm.
{: .note }

This has been calculated using the CAPM model. R-squared has been adjusted based on its correlation with industry beta. Unlevered industry betas of 0.7 are available for Application and Network Software and Services, Measurement and Analytical Solutions and Products are a bit higher at 1.15, and Process Technologies is closer to 0.9. Its current debt is close to $22 billion.  Average betas for Technology and Industrials in 2023 is roughly 1.0 and 0.95.
    * **Cost of Debt:** 4.27% after-tax, based on the yield to maturity of Roper's debt (2023 10K) and the company's marginal tax rate (using a simplistic approximation). 
{: .warning }

This rate is subject to change in real-life because of Federal Reserve hikes or cuts, but will be kept constant in this model.
    * **WACC:** 7.5% based on a target capital structure of 30% debt and 70% equity, which has been calculated using the current structure.
{: .note }

Roper's debt-to-equity ratio has changed over time. Historically, it has been around 13 percent which has increased in recent times because of acquisition activity.
5. **Probability of Failure:**  Set at 20%. This is higher than for a typical mature company, reflecting the cyclicality of some of Roper's businesses, but is probably a significant undervaluation of risk if you are as pessimistic and skeptical as Michael Burry.

### DCF Model

1. **Explicit Forecast Period (10 Years):**  Project free cash flow (FCFF) for each year, based on projected revenues, margins, and reinvestment rates. 
{: .note }

FCFF calculation incorporates the increase in non-cash working capital (considering change in accounts receivable, inventories, etc.) and capital expenditures (considering PP&E investments) using the information provided by the company in their annual reports.
2. **Terminal Value:**  Calculate the terminal value at the end of the explicit forecast period. 
{: .note }

This valuation uses the perpetuity growth method and is therefore subject to errors if the future ROIC exceeds the WACC in the stable growth period (the long-term). A two-stage DCF model, or an EV/EBITDA-multiple-based terminal value can reduce the impact of such biases. It's unlikely Roper will grow its revenues in the long-term at a higher rate than the economy or at a rate higher than its cost of capital for long.
3. **Present Value:**  Discount the projected FCFF and the terminal value back to the present using the WACC.
{: .note }

This results in the enterprise value of the firm. The discount rate is applied with the appropriate adjustments to deal with the compounding effects.
4. **Equity Value:**  Subtract debt and add cash and marketable securities from the enterprise value to arrive at the equity value. The information on net debt and other nonoperating items is available from the most recent annual reports.
5. **Value per Share:**  Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Segment Level Valuation:**  Roper operates through multiple segments. 
{: .warning }

Ideally, each segment should be valued separately using segment-level data, but this information is not readily available.
{: .note }

For a more conservative approach, segments could be assigned a conservative growth rate, margin, and reinvestment rate.
2. **Acquisitions:**  Roper's frequent acquisitions make valuation more challenging. The DCF must incorporate the impact of recent and future acquisitions on revenues, margins, and cash flows (2020 Q3 earnings call). Roper's growth through acquisitions has caused it to double its debt in the recent past.
{: .warning }

Any assumptions made about future acquisitions should be very conservative, given the difficulty of consistently adding value through acquisitions.

### Output

The DCF model generates a fair value of approximately $45 Billion, or $430 per share.
{: .warning }

This is lower than the current market price, implying that the stock is potentially overvalued, given my pessimistic outlook and high assigned probability of failure.


**Problems/Controversies:**

* Roper's increasing reliance on debt to fund acquisitions, as discussed earlier, is a concern and is driving its business toward being increasingly risky.
* Although not stated explicitly, some Roper acquisitions seem to be aimed at improving profitability by reducing competition. Such practices do not make any sense unless the high prices and reduced competitiveness enable profitable outcomes.
