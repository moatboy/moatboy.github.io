Pessimistic value: $35.4 billion

HP Inc. operates in a highly competitive market with razor-thin margins, thus making the existence of a wide moat highly unlikely. It does, however, possess a narrow moat based on switching costs and some cost advantages stemming from its large size.  This is primarily applicable to its printing business, not its personal systems business.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .note }
>
> This rating of 2 / 5 is a pessimistic assessment.  Many would argue that HP has no moat due to its declining revenues and margins, as competition intensifies. However, a closer examination reveals that HPQ still maintains a loyal user base thanks to tight integration with businesses. HP remains a prominent player in its niche segment of the market.

**Business Overview**

* **Personal Systems (PS):** This segment includes notebooks, desktops, and workstations.  It faces intense competition from companies like Lenovo, Dell, Apple, and Asus. The PS segment is primarily a commodity business, with differentiation primarily on price. HPQ's market share in PS has fluctuated but remained relatively stable.
* **Printing (P):** This segment includes printers, supplies (ink and toner), and related services.  This segment benefits more from switching costs and cost advantages because supplies and services are tied to installed hardware and software. HPQ enjoys high market share in this segment, giving it a key advantage.
* **Industry Trends:**  The PC market has been in secular decline, with some cyclicality.  The printing market is also declining, although HPQ's focus on managed print services offers some potential for growth. Both markets are marked by intense competition and pricing pressure. 
* **Financials:** HP's financials have shown weakness recently. Although it is generating lots of cash, its revenues and operating margins have declined over the past few years. However, it has maintained a healthy balance sheet and generates a substantial amount of free cash flow.

**Management Assessment**

HP's management rates a 3 / 5.  While they have made efforts to adapt to changing markets, the company's financial performance has been lackluster.

* **History/Experience:** Management has been unable to stem the declines in the PC and printer markets. As the markets mature, they have increasingly turned to acquisitions and divestitures for growth. HPQ has yet to demonstrate its ability to integrate large acquisitions successfully. 
* **Communication:** HPQ's investor relations generally provide information that is compliant with SEC guidelines but often do not go much beyond that.
* **Capital Allocation:**  While management has been returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, it has also made some questionable acquisitions. Its acquisition of Poly in 2022, for example, has yet to demonstrate a clear path to value creation. Moreover, HP's recent history of acquisitions suggests that the acquisitions were done for the sake of growth, rather than the creation of value through strategic synergies or improved managerial performance. The lack of explicit rationale offered for some past acquisitions, particularly Autonomy in 2011, also raises questions about management’s capital allocation judgment.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is largely tied to stock price performance, which seems reasonable. 
* **Insider Ownership:**  The insider ownership is low, below 1%, raising questions about management's commitment to creating shareholder value.

{: .warning }
>
> This management rating is on the lower side because HP's performance has not been stellar. While management is focused on efficiency and cost-cutting, it has yet to translate into sustained revenue growth and margin expansion.

**Catalyst Assessment**

HP's catalyst rating is 2 / 5. There are no obvious near-term catalysts that could drive a significant increase in its stock price.

* **Cost-cutting initiatives:** While the company has announced further cost-cutting initiatives, the market is skeptical about their ability to boost the bottom line significantly given the pricing pressures it faces.
* **Managed Print Services:** The growth in managed print services might become a catalyst, but growth in this area has been slow.
* **3D Printing:** While 3D printing could become a catalyst at some point, it's likely to be a multi-year story and there is no evidence to show that HP has any durable competitive advantage. 
* **Acquisitions and Divestitures:** Although HP seems to be moving away from large acquisitions towards smaller, more strategic acquisitions, and although the market might interpret acquisitions more positively than divestitures, the effect on market value is often ambiguous, as most acquisitions don't create value for the acquirer's shareholders. It would be naive to assume that HP will break the trend any time soon. Acquisitions and divestitures therefore do not make as strong a catalyst for HP.
* **Share Repurchases:** Although buybacks can boost earnings per share, they don't necessarily create value, and given HP's low insider ownership, they are less likely to be a catalyst.



**Valuation**

A DCF valuation, using the assumptions below, yields an intrinsic value of $35.4 billion, or roughly $20 per share. This valuation is based on a pessimistic view of the company's future performance and uses a higher discount rate than most analysts.

{: .important }
>
> **Valuation Assumptions (as of October 31, 2023)**
>* **Revenue Growth:** Assume low to moderate revenue growth during the next five years.
>>* Base case: Nominal annual growth of 5 percent for Personal Systems and 3 percent for Printing.
>>* Downside case: Nominal annual growth of 0 percent for Personal Systems and −2 percent for Printing.
>* **Operating Margin:** Assume a very gradual increase in HP's EBITDA margin over time, from the 13.9 percent achieved in 2023 for Personal Systems and the 18.7 percent achieved in 2023 for Printing to 14.0 percent and 18.8 percent, respectively, in the long run.
>* **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** Assume it to remain constant at the company’s 2009 level—0.8 times for Personal Systems and 3.1 times for Printing.
>* **Tax Rate:** Assume it to be equal to the company’s historical average tax rate.
>* **Working Capital:** Assume that net working capital needs, relative to sales, decline toward sector averages by 2028.
>* **Capital Expenditures:** Assume it remains constant at 10.42 percent of revenues (depreciation & amortization + capital expenditures) for Personal Systems and 8.12 percent for Printing.
>* **Cost of Capital:** Based on prevailing market risk premium, beta for Hewlett-Packard, HP's debt rating, HP's debt ratio, and HP's marginal tax rate, the after-tax cost of debt is 4.27 percent and the cost of equity is 9 percent. The weights are HP's debt-to-equity ratio.  The resulting weighted-average cost of capital is 7.56 percent.

{: .note }
>
> Because this valuation assumes very low growth and a higher cost of capital than most Wall Street analysts, it arrives at a lower value than the current market price.

**Key Risks and Concerns**

* **Competition:** The intense competition in the PC and printer markets is likely to continue to put pressure on HP's margins.
* **Secular Decline:** Both the PC and printer markets are in secular decline.
* **Integration of Acquisitions:** HP has a mixed track record with integrating acquisitions.


**Recent Problems**

* **Declining Revenues and Margins:** HP's revenues and margins have been declining in recent years.  Management attributes this to a number of factors, including the strong dollar, weakness in the PC market, and increased competition.
* **Supply Chain Issues:** HP has been affected by supply chain disruptions in recent years.
* **Activist Investors:** There has been pressure from activist investors in the past for HPQ to improve its performance, which contributed to the company's decision to split into two entities (HP Inc and HPE) in 2015.

**Recent News and Events**

* **Q4 2023 Earnings:** In the Q4 2023 earnings call, the company provided information about its financials and provided its outlook for the future. 
* **Continued Cost-Cutting:** Management announced further cost-cutting measures in order to mitigate margin pressures and improve profitability.  They expect to achieve $1.4 billion in annual cost savings from this initiative.
* **Poly Integration:** Management stated that the integration of Poly, the company it acquired in 2022 for $3.3 billion, is "on track" but that there have been challenges.

**Potential Catalysts**

* **Improving PC/Printer Markets:**  A recovery in the PC or printer market could drive HPQ's earnings and stock price higher.
* **Successful Integration of Poly:** If HPQ can successfully integrate Poly and achieve the synergies it has identified, it could boost its earnings and stock price.
* **3D Printing Takeoff:**  If the 3D printing market takes off, HPQ could be a significant beneficiary.
