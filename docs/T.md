Pessimistic value: $120 B

AT&T operates in a highly competitive telecommunications market. While it possesses some scale advantages, the increasing commoditization of its services and heavy debt burden limit its moat. The company's management has shown a mixed record, with questionable capital allocation decisions and a lackluster communication strategy. There are few visible catalysts on the horizon that could dramatically change the company's trajectory.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

AT&T's size and established network once provided a substantial moat. However, this has eroded due to several factors:

* **Commoditization of services:**  The core services offered by AT&T (wireless, broadband internet) have become increasingly commoditized. As Graham and Dodd note, the more a company sells something like everybody else, the more its profits are affected by commodity prices (think of airlines, steel producers). Thus, pricing pressure and customer churn have increased, eroding profits.
* **Rise of smaller competitors:**  Smaller, more nimble competitors have taken market share from AT&T. 
* **Heavy debt burden:** AT&T's significant debt load limits its financial flexibility and ability to invest in future growth.  This makes it harder to compete effectively against more financially sound competitors.  The high debt also increases the company's risk, affecting its cost of capital.

> In Q3 2023, John Stankey, CEO, stated, "In Wireless...we’ve improved service revenues for nine consecutive quarters, and our focus on providing the best network for customers remains central to growing our profitable customer base in this segment" (Q3 2023 Earnings Call). This statement shows the company is focused on profitability in its core business, but it does not address the structural challenges posed by the rise of smaller competitors and heavy capital requirements.

**Management (2/5):**

AT&T's management receives a mixed rating due to several factors:

{: .warning }
* **Questionable capital allocation:** AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner and DirecTV were very expensive and did not create much value for shareholders. As McKinsey’s “Valuation” points out, acquisitions rarely create substantial value.  More recent initiatives such as the FirstNet buildout show better capital allocation, though the overall track record is still unconvincing.
{: .important }
* **Mediocre Communication:** Management has not done a great job communicating its long-term strategy to investors, focusing on short-term metrics like earnings per share. As Damodaran emphasizes, intrinsic investors want transparency about results, and management often falls short of providing it.
* **Compensation:**  While executive compensation is high, it does not seem to be strongly linked to long-term value creation.  This lack of alignment with shareholders' interests is a concern.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Moderate insider ownership offers some comfort, but it's not enough to fully offset other concerns.

> During the Q2 2023 earnings call, Pascal Desroches, CFO, mentioned, “We are accelerating our network build-out to ensure a fast, reliable and affordable fiber and connectivity experience.” But at the same time, he stated, "Capital Investment…was $4.6 billion.  This is up from $3.9 billion a year ago and reflects an increase in investment, primarily in fiber and 5G" (Q2 2023 Earnings Call). While this sounds logical, the massive investments in the past years have not yielded great returns, raising concerns about management's judgment in capital budgeting and future strategic direction.

**Catalyst (1/5):**

There are few catalysts on the horizon that could significantly change the company's trajectory:

* **Fiber expansion:** While the expansion of AT&T's fiber network has some potential, it is not unique and faces intense competition.
* **5G rollout:** The 5G rollout is a long-term play with uncertain outcomes.

Overall, these initiatives are not likely to result in a significant increase in intrinsic value soon.

**Valuation ($120 Billion):**

We used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate AT&T’s intrinsic value. Given the company’s complex financials, we performed a sum-of-the-parts valuation, considering each operating business segment (Communications, Warner Media, Latin America) and its non-operating assets separately. The discount rate was based on each segment’s cost of capital (WACC), adjusted for country-specific risk where applicable. The assumptions used in the valuation were made in accordance with the provided books on valuation and were conservative.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:** We project a more conservative 3-5% revenue growth for each business segments for the next five years, in line with GDP growth, reflecting increasing competition and saturation in the telecommunications industry.
* **Operating margins:** We assume stable operating margins for each business segment over the next 10 years,  reflecting competitive pressures.
* **Reinvestment rate:** We project a reinvestment rate of 10-20% for each business segment, decreasing over time as these business mature.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** We assume a WACC of 7.5% for AT&T overall, reflecting the risk associated with operating in a competitive industry and its heavy debt burden.  The WACC for each segment was adjusted accordingly based on its financial leverage and operating risk.
* **Terminal Value:** We assume a 2% nominal growth rate beyond year 10, in line with nominal GDP growth, and a terminal return on invested capital equal to WACC for each segment to compute the terminal value.

**Valuation Methodology**

* **Step 1:**  We collected historical financial data for AT&T over the past 10 years from the firm's filings. We reorganized the company's annual reports by business segments (Mobility, Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline, WarnerMedia, Mexico, Latin America, and Corporate and Other). For non-public segments, we used the most recent quarterly reports and six-month numbers to construct annual numbers. Note that, in some cases, the resulting financials may be based on different reporting periods for different business segments.

* **Step 2:** We forecast the company’s financials over the next 10 years.  The forecast horizon is longer than the forecast period used in earlier sections, as maturity for some business units or the business entirely may still be several years ahead. Using the reorganized financials from Step 1, we projected each segment’s revenues and operating profits, incorporating economic and industry trends identified in its earnings calls. We also estimated capital expenditures, working capital, and financing needs.

* **Step 3:** We estimated the cost of capital and the terminal value. For each segment, we estimated its cost of capital (WACC) based on its risk profile and target debt ratios. For the terminal value, we adopted the conservative perpetuity approach.

* **Step 4:**  We discounted the projected cash flows and terminal values to their present values. We discounted the free cash flows for each segment at its cost of capital, and the terminal value at the cost of capital minus the assumed perpetual growth rate.

* **Step 5:** We summed the present values across segments and added the value of nonoperating assets (cash, marketable securities, financial investments, etc.) and subtracted debt and other non-equity claims to arrive at the intrinsic value of equity.

This valuation methodology produced an intrinsic value for AT&T of approximately $120 billion. Given the uncertainty surrounding the company's prospects, our valuation is significantly lower than its market capitalization at the time of this valuation.

> There is always some hidden or other component of a stock valuation and how much of a potential for mischief the shareholder is willing to put up with to get it. A respectable valuation of Chrysler's common is difficult now, as it always has been. Assessing a company based on its financials after a recapitalization that did not generate cash is pretty risky. For a deeper look, see Graham's explanation on this in the commentary on chapter 1. However, assuming some sort of normalcy, the company does have a lot of assets. The question is how will AT&T manage its risks as well as its cash going forward?
