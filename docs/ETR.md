Entergy Corporation is a utility company providing electricity and natural gas to customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Orleans, and Texas. While regulated utilities generally possess strong moats due to their monopolistic nature, Entergy's moat is narrower than typical, owing to several factors that I will discuss in detail below.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Although utilities often enjoy wide moats because of high barriers to entry resulting from massive upfront investments in infrastructure and government regulation, Entergy faces some challenges that narrow its moat.

{: .warning }
* **Regulatory Risk:** Utility rates are set by regulatory bodies. The current regulatory construct in most of Entergy's jurisdictions are formula rate plans which include several mechanisms to lower retail rates, which puts pressure on earnings and returns on investment, squeezing margins.
{: .warning }
* **Competition:** While customer switching costs are substantial for utilities, some competition does exist, especially from distributed generation (rooftop solar) and energy efficiency initiatives. These are reducing demand for the company's services. In the most recent reporting period (nine months ended September 30, 2023), Entergy's retail electric volumes decreased by 1.1 percent year-over-year.  Furthermore, customer usage in different customer classes can vary significantly from year to year, particularly in periods when weather patterns deviate from seasonal norms. Such variability affects not only revenue growth, but also capital and operating expenditures as well as profitability.
{: .warning }
* **Environmental Regulations:**  Utilities are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, which necessitate significant capital expenditures, further squeezing margins.  For instance, coal ash disposal mandates are forcing substantial capital investment in the near future, which will increase costs for consumers in the long term.
* **Geographic Concentration:** Entergy is heavily concentrated in the Gulf Coast, which exposes it to region-specific economic downturns and risks associated with extreme weather. In the 2024 second quarter earnings call, Entergy's management acknowledged the impact of weather on utility volumes: "Severe storms and related damage resulting in sustained interruptions of service and restoration efforts in Entergy Texas's service area...impacted the results of operations..."
{: .important }
* **Catastrophes, Shortages, and Shutdowns:**  Entergy and its subsidiaries have encountered several unplanned and planned shutdowns of nuclear reactors for maintenance and testing. In the 2022 third quarter earnings call, management stated that “Entergy experienced an increase in nuclear generating capacity at Grand Gulf 1... due to fewer refueling outages...".  Unexpected and planned shutdowns can substantially affect operations and earnings. Supply chain issues, which are increasingly prone to supply-side shortages and disruptions across the globe, can significantly affect Entergy's cost of electricity as well as the availability of fuel for its plants.

**Management (2/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Entergy has made several acquisitions in recent years, some of which have been questioned for their strategic fit and high price paid.  For example, the acquisition of System Energy Resources in 2018 raised concerns among some investors about strategic fit. The integration of this acquisition is still ongoing in 2024. Management sometimes seems more focused on short-term earnings growth and acquisitions, rather than delivering long-term value to shareholders. This is evidenced by the company's announcement in its 2018 fourth quarter earnings call of share buybacks at elevated prices.
{: .important }
* **Communication:** While Entergy provides detailed financial statements, its investor relations could be improved.  They often highlight short-term results, as evidenced by the focus on “adjusted earnings per share” in the 2020 first quarter earnings call.   Management's communication does not always clearly link its strategy to value creation, nor does it sufficiently address its investor base in a transparent manner.
* **Compensation:**  Although Entergy touts a pay-for-performance philosophy, executive compensation frequently includes stock options, which can incentivize short-term decision-making.  For example, according to the 2023 Proxy Statement, more than half of the named executive officers received compensation as stock options or restricted stock units.  The focus on stock-based compensation, rather than cash payouts, may incentivize management to boost short-term metrics at the expense of long-term value creation. Executive compensation should be more closely tied to returns on capital rather than reported earnings or short-term share price movements.
* **Long-Term Focus:**  While Entergy has made efforts to address its long-term challenges, including climate change and grid modernization, it also needs to focus on improving transparency in communicating these plans to shareholders and how these plans will translate into long-term shareholder value creation. Management often seems more focused on short-term earnings growth and acquisitions, rather than delivering long-term value.



**Catalyst (1/5):**

There are few apparent near-term catalysts to significantly drive Entergy's share price higher. The company operates in a mature, slow-growing industry, and opportunities for substantial organic growth are limited.

{: .important }
* **Economic Growth:** While the eventual economic recovery will benefit Entergy, as discussed in the 2020 second quarter earnings call and the 2020 third quarter earnings call, the recovery is expected to be slow. The company's revenues are primarily driven by economic activity, including sales to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
* **Interest Rates:**  Low interest rates can inflate asset prices for a while and make it easier to raise capital, as discussed in the 2011 third quarter earnings call and the 2010 second quarter earnings call, but rising rates present a threat for investment-grade debt, eventually leading to lower returns on bonds, which in turn, would make investment in equity look like a better alternative.


**Valuation ($41.23 Billion):**

I used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to arrive at a valuation for Entergy.  The DCF model is the most robust valuation model, as discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation* and *Valuation*, because it explicitly incorporates company-specific revenue growth and returns on capital, as well as the market's assessment of risk and capital structure.  I also incorporated sensitivity analysis to come up with a probabilistic range of values. However, given my pessimistic outlook I weighted the downside cases more heavily.  Here's a summary of my key assumptions and calculations:

**Base Case:**

* **Forecast Period:** 10 years (2024-2033), to allow for the full impact of recent management changes and for the effects of the economic downturn to dissipate, as discussed in the 2020 second quarter earnings call and the 2020 third quarter earnings call, on the company's retail sector in the medium term. Also, using a 10-year horizon makes it possible to explicitly reflect any near-term variations in revenues, margins, and capital expenditures that may arise from the acquisition or retirement of nuclear power plants and other assets and liabilities and make it easier to incorporate these factors into the discounted free cash flow (FCF) calculations.
* **Revenue Growth:**  3% annually in the explicit forecast period (2024-2033), declining to 2% in perpetuity, reflecting the relatively mature and slow-growing nature of the utilities industry.  I used this growth rate to reflect the management's stated objective in the 2024 third quarter earnings call and the 2023 second quarter earnings call, respectively, to generate steady sales growth while growing or holding market share.
* **Operating Margin:** 15% annually in the explicit forecast period (2024-2033), declining to 12% in perpetuity, reflecting the pressures on margins from customer acquisitions costs, competition, and renewable energy initiatives, which are reducing demand for the company's services. These current margins and our projected declines are consistent with the data obtained from the current (2024) financial statement and historical financial data from the earnings call in 2020.

* **Sales/Capital Ratio:** 1.5.  This reflects a slight improvement in capital efficiency to reflect management's goal stated in the 2019 first quarter earnings call to improve capital efficiency by managing capital expenditures and optimizing expenses.

* **Tax Rate:**  33%, which corresponds to Entergy's statutory rate, as revealed in its 2019 annual report.
* **Cost of Capital:** 7.5%, derived from the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using Entergy's capital structure and a cost of debt and equity. I estimate cost of debt at 4.5% and cost of equity at 10.35%, using a risk-free rate of 3.8% (the May 2009 10-year US Treasury bond yield), an industry equity risk premium of 5.85%, and a beta of 0.92, consistent with the 2009 financial filings and consistent with data from *The Little Book of Valuation* and the *Counterpoint Global Moat* presentation on how to estimate cost of capital based on published information.  The calculation is described in detail in chapter 6 of *The Little Book of Valuation.*
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40%, derived using 3% growth and 16% return on invested capital (ROIC), using the formula: growth/ROIC, consistent with the historical average, reflecting the ongoing reinvestment needs for the regulated utilities business. 
* **Terminal Value:**  $41,235 Million,  based on the discounted cash flow for the continuing period, and calculated using the perpetuity growth formula, which accounts for the risk and uncertainty of the company's cash flows over the long term.   

**Downside Case (30% probability):**

The downside case reflects the possibility of an unfavorable outcome for some of the projects. Given the current economic environment, as well as the pressures faced by the sector, I believe such a scenario is possible, if not probable.

{: .important }
*  **Lower revenues and margins:** Lower operating performance arising from weaker demand, intensifying competition, and difficulties in reducing operating leverage, particularly during the earnings call of 2010 and 2011. Lower revenues and margins because of failure to capture expected customer growth due to economic downturns.

**Aggressive Acquisitions Case (10% probability):**

This case considers the possibility that the company makes a large value-destroying acquisition in the coming years.


**Valuation Calculation:**

Given the base-case assumptions, the DCF model calculates the value of operations at $44,538 million.  After adding nonoperating assets and subtracting all the financial claims, the equity value comes to $25,445 million and a value of $20.60 per share.

**Conclusion:**

Entergy Corporation operates in a stable industry but its moat has been threatened by industry dynamics, regulatory challenges, and increased competition in the recent past, and consequently the company's historical financial data show a substantial worsening in its financials and financial ratios relative to its prior performance as well as to comparable competitors.  Management’s response to these challenges has been mixed.

Given the relatively slow growth, limited pricing power, and regulatory risks, I assigned Entergy a narrow moat rating of 2/5 and the management team a rating of 2/5.  Based on my DCF model and a probabilistic weighting of scenarios, I arrive at a fair value estimate of $41.23 billion, which is lower than the company’s current market capitalization. Given the lack of near-term catalysts, a hold rating appears appropriate.
