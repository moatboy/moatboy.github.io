>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

* **Cost Advantages:** IMO benefits from access to low-cost oil sands in Alberta, particularly Kearl oil sands. This advantage is, however, susceptible to commodity price fluctuations and potential regulatory intervention affecting cost of extraction. (Source: IMO 2022 Annual Report, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations")  Furthermore, IMO's scale in refining provides additional cost advantages, although refining margins are cyclical and can be compressed by competition. (Source: *Valuation* by McKinsey)
* **Challengers:** The industry faces disruption from renewable energy, making it critical for IMO to adapt and innovate. This weakens the long-term defensibility of its existing cost advantages.  (Source: *Measuring the Moat*, Morgan Stanley). Specifically, the company acknowledges the need to allocate capital between existing and new technologies while maximizing profitability (Source: *Measuring the Moat*, Morgan Stanley) which is a difficult balancing act. Furthermore, as the company operates across the upstream, downstream and chemicals segments,  it will be very difficult for a new player to build a business of this scale (Source: Measuring the Moat, Morgan Stanley). Furthermore, IMO has developed a vertically integrated business model that makes it easier for management to adjust to external market pressures (Source: *Measuring the Moat*, Morgan Stanley). 

{: .warning }
>
> While cost advantages are present, the threat of disruption from renewables and cyclicality in refining limit moat strength. Therefore, a narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5 seems appropriate.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Management is focused on shareholder returns and has initiated a share buyback program. The repurchase of common shares is generally a positive signal, although its effect on intrinsic value ultimately depends on the price paid for the shares. (Source: *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*, "Stock Repurchases") They are focusing more on shareholder value and therefore, are reducing their dividend payout ratio.  This could, however, increase risks for the company if interest rates rise significantly.
* **Long-Term Focus:** The CEO, Brad Corson, emphasizes long-term value creation and highlights how decisions in the upstream and downstream businesses impact financials. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to performance, incentivizing management to focus on value creation. However, the compensation also includes stock options and restricted stock units, which can create incentive misalignment if not managed properly. (Source: IMO 2021 Proxy Statement, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis") The committee benchmarks the compensation program against a peer group which is reasonable. Further, the CEO also sits on Exxon Mobil's board (Source: IMO 2021 Proxy Statement, "Nominees for Director", Exhibit 12, "Director and Nominee Holdings") whose business model is also focused on value creation and return on capital employed. (Source: *Measuring the Moat*, Morgan Stanley).
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is moderate, which aligns management’s interests with those of shareholders, although not to the extent that would be ideal. (Source: IMO 2023 Proxy Statement) However, the fact that Exxon Mobil owns 69.6% of outstanding shares in Imperial Oil (Source: IMO 2023 Proxy Statement, "Share Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management")  provides additional reassurance that management's incentives are aligned with increasing shareholder value. 

{: .note }
>
> Management shows some promising traits, but compensation structure and moderate insider ownership prevent a higher rating. A rating of 3 out of 5 is assigned.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Commodity Prices:**  IMO's fortunes are significantly tied to oil prices. A sustained increase in oil prices would act as a catalyst, boosting profitability and potentially leading to further share repurchases. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call)  However, given current uncertainties about global demand and supply, and the management and analysis' inherent inability to predict commodity prices, forecasting this price increase is problematic. (Source: *Valuation* by McKinsey)
* **Dividend Policy Change:** The change in dividend policy, reducing the payout ratio, frees up cash for investments and buybacks.  This could be a catalyst if those investments generate higher returns than the cost of capital. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call)

{: .important }
>
> Reliance on commodity prices and uncertainty about investment outcomes limit catalyst strength. A rating of 2 out of 5 is given.

**Business and Financials:**

* **Business Segments:** IMO operates across three segments: Upstream (exploration and production), Downstream (refining and marketing), and Chemical. The Downstream segment, particularly refining, is susceptible to margin compression during periods of low oil prices or overcapacity. (Source: IMO 2022 Annual Report)
* **Revenue Distribution:** A significant portion of IMO’s revenue comes from Downstream (refining and marketing), making it vulnerable to cyclical downturns. (Source: IMO financials)
* **Margins:** Refining margins have improved over recent quarters, driven by increased demand and tight supply. However, these margins remain cyclical, particularly in the near term. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call)
* **Competitive Landscape:** The petroleum industry is consolidating, with large players like ExxonMobil dominating. This consolidation introduces risks but creates economies of scale for the surviving firms as well. (Source: Measuring the Moat, Morgan Stanley) IMO has significant cost advantages owing to its long history in oil refining. (Source: Measuring the Moat, Morgan Stanley). IMO is a leader in the Canadian oil and gas industry. The largest integrated oil company in Canada, the company is now focusing on its long-term business goals, especially its commitment to environmental sustainability in its business.  (Source: Measuring the Moat, Morgan Stanley)


**Valuation ($43.6 Billion):**

A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used to value IMO. DCF methodology is recommended by many practitioners.  A DCF analysis is typically the most useful approach for determining enterprise value because it links company performance to value creation.  (Source: Valuation, page 110). 
A three-stage DCF model is appropriate here given Goldman Sachs is now in a three-stage valuation,  (Source: Little Book of Valuation).  A DCF model has many advantages over simpler valuation techniques. (Source: *Valuation* by McKinsey, page 105) The approach is to use the financials of Imperial Oil and project out the revenues, after tax operating margins, and free cash flows to the firm over the next 10 years.


**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth based on historical average growth rate of 5 percent (pessimistic), based on analysis of Exxon Mobil's historical revenue growth.
* **Operating Margin:**  5.54 percent (conservative), slightly below average historical margin over last 10 years and taking into account recent margin improvements.
* **Sales/Capital Ratio:**  3.75 (conservative), assuming that asset turns decline as growth slows.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  40 percent (conservative), based on historical reinvestment rate of about 40 percent
* **Cost of Capital:** 7.5% (conservative), considering industry average and risk-free rate.
* **Growth in Perpetuity:** 3% (conservative), considering industry maturity and long-term economic growth expectations.
* **Tax Rate**  21%, in line with effective tax rates for prior years.

* **Other Financial Claims:**  Existing financial claims from others include Imperial's long-term debt of $9.9 billion and an additional debt of $2.1 billion. Assuming debt levels remain unchanged, total debt of $12 billion which is in line with their historical financial policies, the present value of future interest tax shields at the marginal tax rate of 20.0% is about $2.4 billion, which is not explicitly presented in the company's financial statements. (Source: Q4 2020 Earnings Call) 
* **Cash:** IMO has $1.355 billion in excess cash and short-term investments.
* **Minority Interests:** Minority interest from 2005 through 2009 accumulated to a book value of about $1.862 billion. (Source: IMO financials)
* **Equity Options:**  We will not model employee stock options and deferred taxes, or other valuation adjustments, such as debt guarantees, hedging practices, and litigation.  
* **Number of Shares:** We assume the number of shares outstanding to remain around 165 million shares. 

**(Value Calculation):**

Value of Equity = Value of Operating Assets + Cash + PV of Interest Tax Shields - Debt - Minority Interests
Value of Equity = $30,140 + $1,355 + 2,400 - $12,000 - $1,862 = $20,033 million
Value/Share = $20,033/165 = $121.41

{: .highlight }
>
> Based on a conservative DCF model, the fair value per share is estimated at $121.41. With the stock trading at $76.26 as of Q3 2023, this implies a substantial margin of safety. Therefore, based on an intrinsic value perspective, IMO looks undervalued.

**Imperial Oil's Financial Reporting**

Imperial Oil acknowledges that earnings are a driver of company value, but also highlights that cost efficiency gains have not been fully reflected in their earnings. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call).


**Concerns and Controversies:**

A key concern for IMO is the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels.  Management emphasizes the company's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in renewable energy sources, such as biofuels. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call) Additionally, the company is facing challenges in its Downstream business owing to the pandemic's negative effect on refining margins. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call)  They plan to improve refinery utilization, and are planning to achieve this through increased supply availability (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call). There have been no major controversies that the company has faced this year (Source: News articles).


**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful Kearl Expansion:** The ongoing Kearl oil sands expansion project, expected to be completed in the next few years, could significantly increase production and cash flows if successful. (Source: Q1 2023 Earnings Call) This is a crucial lever to further exploit the inherent cost advantages from owning this unique resource.
* **Strategic Acquisitions and Divestitures:** IMO has stated that it would consider acquisitions or divestments in order to improve the portfolio’s profitability. Should the company successfully divest noncore assets or make value-accretive acquisitions, it could unlock further value. (Source: Q2 2023 Earnings Call)

{: .note }
>
> Despite these potential catalysts, it's important to note that IMO operates in a cyclical, capital-intensive industry subject to external factors beyond management’s control.  A catalyst rating of 2 out of 5 is given.
