Pessimistic value: $28.4 B

Kroger operates in a highly competitive grocery industry. While it holds a significant market share, its advantages are not insurmountable, warranting a narrow moat rating of 2.  The management team demonstrates some strengths, but also weaknesses in capital allocation and shareholder returns, resulting in a moderate rating of 3. The catalyst rating is 2, reflecting modest potential upside from improved margins or market share gains, but without a clear and compelling catalyst.  My pessimistic valuation, based on a DCF model, comes to $28.4 billion.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Kroger's revenue comes primarily from grocery sales, with a growing contribution from its digital channels and alternative profit streams (fuel, advertising, financial services). It faces competition from other large grocery chains, discount stores like Walmart, and online delivery services.
* **Industry Trends:** The grocery industry is consolidating, with the biggest players (Walmart, Kroger, and Amazon) gaining market share. This trend is likely to continue, putting pressure on smaller players. E-commerce is also growing rapidly, but profitability remains a challenge. The industry is cyclical and dependent on economic conditions.
* **Margins:** Kroger's operating margins are thin, typically in the low single digits. This is common in the grocery industry due to intense price competition. Improvements in margins could come from cost-cutting, increased efficiency, or pricing power. However, sustaining these improvements can be difficult due to the competitive landscape.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Intense competition from larger players and the rise of discount stores pose a significant threat. Kroger's loyalty programs and private label brands provide some differentiation, but switching costs for consumers are low.
* **Differentiators:**  Kroger's vast network of stores and supply chain provide scale advantages, particularly at a local level. These advantages make it easier to enter new geographic areas profitably, but they do not create a large and enduring moat at the national level.

{: .highlight }

Kroger's 2023 Q2 earnings call highlights a focus on improving customer experience and maximizing the value of each store. The management mentioned how the company is improving its product and services by increasing its delivery reach, adding new brands, and upgrading existing stores. They're also working on optimizing fuel efficiency. The CEO mentioned, "This focus on maximizing store performance is central to Kroger's value creation strategy" (Q2 2023 Earnings Call). While these strategies show promise for creating value, there is no guarantee they will increase above-average returns on invested capital and protect Kroger from its highly competitive landscape.  This makes it a less attractive investment for those seeking wide-moat companies.

**Management Assessment**

* **History/Experience:** Kroger's management team has a mixed track record. While the company has maintained a stable dividend and achieved some cost savings, total shareholder returns have lagged the broader market over recent years. 
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation at Kroger appears to be largely performance-based, which is positive. However, the actual performance itself has not been stellar.
* **Insider Ownership:** A moderate level of insider ownership suggests some alignment with shareholder interests, but it is not high enough to be a strong positive factor.
* **Communication:** Kroger's investor relations materials offer some useful information, but they could be more detailed and transparent. For instance, they could provide more specific information on profitability and returns on capital for each business segment.
* **Capital Allocation:**  Kroger has made several acquisitions over the years, which could improve its market position. However, it's not clear whether these acquisitions have been value-creating, particularly given its focus on acquisitions as a way to grow.  Also, it has engaged in share repurchases when the share price is not high - a negative signal.



{: .warning }

A recent concern about Kroger is the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) inquiry into its proposed merger with Albertsons. There is a risk that the FTC will block the merger, which could cause Kroger's share price to drop in the short term. The management has consistently defended the merger in its earnings calls, arguing that it will benefit consumers and create value for shareholders. However, given the FTC's focus on antitrust issues and prior rejections of similar mergers, this should be treated as a clear risk. If the merger does not go through, Kroger will need to consider how to achieve scale, efficiency and revenue growth organically or through a different merger.

**Valuation**

I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Kroger. A DCF model is the most robust approach to valuing companies, as it focuses on the future cash flows generated by a business. However, it is also sensitive to the input assumptions, especially the growth rate and the cost of capital. To address this sensitivity and given my pessimistic outlook, I made the following conservative assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% annually for the next 5 years, declining to 1% thereafter. This reflects the intense competition in the grocery industry and the slow growth of the overall market.
* **Operating Margin:** 1.5% in the terminal year. This is below Kroger's historical average, reflecting the ongoing price competition.
* **Cost of Capital:** 7.56%. This is based on a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) calculation using a cost of equity of 9% and a cost of debt of 4.27%. The weights are based on a target capital structure of 44% debt and 56% equity, which is more conservative than Krogerâ€™s current leverage.
* **Tax Rate:** 25%.

**Valuation Calculations**
* **NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes):** This is the profit available to all investors (debt and equity).
* **Invested Capital:** The book value of operating assets.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** NOPLAT / Invested Capital.
* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** NOPLAT * (1 - Reinvestment Rate).
* **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** The cost of equity and debt weighted by their proportion of value.
* **Terminal Value:** Represents the present value of all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period. It is calculated using the perpetuity growth method as follows:
Terminal Value = (FCF in terminal year * (1 + growth rate)) / (WACC - growth rate)
* **Present Value:** The discounted value of all FCFs and the terminal value. This is done using a discounted rate that is equal to the WACC.

These pessimistic assumptions yielded a DCF valuation of $28.4 billion. This assumes that Kroger will be acquired for its market value of $30.4 billion. The calculations are presented in detail in the table below:

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Operating Margin (%) | NOPLAT ($B) | Reinvestment Rate (%) | FCF ($B) | WACC (%) | PV ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 151.0 | 1.1% | 1.4 | 40% | 0.85 | 8.8% | 0.76 |
| 2 | 154.0 | 1.2% | 1.5 | 40% | 0.91 | 8.8% | 0.74 |
| 3 | 157.1 | 1.3% | 1.6 | 40% | 0.97 | 8.8% | 0.73 |
| 4 | 160.2 | 1.4% | 1.8 | 40% | 1.08 | 8.8% | 0.71 |
| 5 | 163.4 | 1.5% | 1.9 | 40% | 1.15 | 8.8% | 0.70 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  |  |  | 21.46 |
| **Total PV** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **25.10** |
| **Cash, Non-operating Assets** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **3.3** |
| **Estimated Value** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **28.4** |


**Catalyst Assessment**

There is no obvious near-term catalyst for a significant re-rating of Kroger. While improvements in margins or digital sales could provide upside, these factors are unlikely to move the needle significantly given the industry headwinds. The potential upside from the merger with Albertsons is offset by the significant downside risk if the FTC blocks it. This warrants a moderate catalyst rating of 2.


{: .note }

One potentially positive catalyst is a further increase in private label penetration. Kroger has a growing private label business, which tends to be more profitable than branded products. If Kroger can continue to increase its private label penetration, it could improve its margins and make itself more attractive to investors.


**Conclusion**

Kroger is a mixed bag. Its large market share and scale advantages are positives, but the fierce competition in the grocery industry and the thin margins are negatives. The management team has a mixed track record, and there is no compelling near-term catalyst. My pessimistic valuation, based on a DCF model with conservative assumptions, is $28.4 billion.  This suggests that the stock is overvalued at current levels and may not be a good investment for those seeking above-average, long-term returns.
