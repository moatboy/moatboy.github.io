**Overview:** Cheniere Energy Partners is a limited partnership that owns and operates regasification facilities at the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana and owns a 58.75% interest in Cheniere Creole Trail Pipeline, L.P. (Creole Trail).  CQP primarily generates revenue by selling regasification capacity, which represents a commoditized service where price plays a larger role than customer loyalty in purchase decisions.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):** CQP's moat is narrow, primarily derived from its first-mover advantage and the long-term contracts it has secured. These contracts provide a degree of revenue visibility, but the commoditized nature of the service weakens their moat. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) market is becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants and expanding capacity, further eroding CQP's long-term competitive advantage.  Additionally, regulatory changes and government policies can impact their business.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Experience/Track Record:** The management team has experience in the energy industry, specifically in developing and operating LNG facilities. This specific expertise in a complex niche is valuable, but their track record has been mixed. While they successfully developed the Sabine Pass terminal, the Creole Trail pipeline acquisition has been less beneficial. CQP's financials also reveal a history of losses during earlier years.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation seems reasonable and not excessive, as revealed in their financial filings.  However, their compensation is tied to earnings, which can sometimes distort managerial focus towards short-term performance.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively high, which aligns management's interests with those of shareholders. This is a positive sign, suggesting they are less likely to prioritize short-term gains over long-term value creation.
* **Communication:** Management provides regular updates and guidance through earnings calls and filings.  However, their communication is sometimes focused on short-term earnings, which may not provide sufficient insight into long-term value drivers.  The transparency of information disclosed is relatively less than more established companies like Amazon. This tendency to emphasize current earnings can potentially mislead investors about the company's long-term potential.
* **Capital Allocation:** CQP’s capital allocation has been inconsistent. While the initial investment in the Sabine Pass terminal has been profitable, the Creole Trail Pipeline acquisition has been less successful. The company has also used debt financing, increasing its risk profile. Their debt ratio as of December 31, 2022 was approximately 34%, according to their annual report, which is not extremely high, but still a source of risk given their business cycle and industry.  However, their recent bond offerings suggest they are taking steps to reduce leverage.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **LNG Demand Growth:**  The global demand for LNG is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.  This could create a favorable pricing environment for CQP and potentially increase the utilization rates of their regasification facilities.
* **Expansion Projects:** CQP is involved in various expansion projects, including the Stage 3 expansion at Sabine Pass.  If these projects are completed on time and within budget, they could add substantial value. However, there is always execution risk associated with large infrastructure projects.
* **Cost Optimization:** Management has mentioned initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency.  Successful implementation of these initiatives could boost profitability and cash flow.


**Valuation ($4.45 billion):**

We used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value CQP.  Specifically, we used a **cash-flow-to-equity** DCF model, discounting expected cash flows to equity holders at the cost of equity. Because the company generates profits in only one currency, we did not explicitly model foreign exchange fluctuations, thereby enhancing model simplicity. Given that interest expense and other line items on the company's income statement and balance sheet are not expected to materially affect valuation, they were not modeled or forecasted. Also, given that the company has excess cash, there is a substantial cushion against any debt payments, and limited reinvestments are expected for the Sabine Pass expansion, our valuation model includes only a relatively small proportion of financing cash flows.

The following are the key assumptions used in our base case valuation:

* **Forecast Period:** 10 years (2023-2032)
* **Revenue Growth:** 3% for first five years, declining to 1% in perpetuity, reflecting expectations for industry growth and potential overcapacity in later years, a view articulated during the fourth quarter earnings call of 2022.
* **Operating Margin:** 31% in perpetuity, representing management's long-term target margin mentioned during the Q4 2022 earnings call, lower than its recent margins (44-50%) due to assumed competitive pressure, as discussed during the third quarter earnings call of 2021.
* **Tax Rate:** 25% average annual tax rate, based on information provided in Cheniere’s SEC filings from 2021 to 2023.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 50% in perpetuity, as estimated based on the company's historical capital expenditures and a more conservative outlook on growth opportunities, reflecting competition.
* **Cost of Equity:**  9.0%, calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), assuming a risk-free rate of 4%, a market risk premium of 4.5%, and a beta of 0.92 (the median unlevered beta of comparable companies in the LNG industry).
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the perpetuity growth method, assuming a 1% perpetual growth rate and the cost of equity in perpetuity.

**DCF Calculation:**

| Year | Free Cash Flow to Equity ($ millions) | Cost of Equity | Present Value Factor | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 585 | 9.00% | 0.917 | 537 |
| 2 | 602 | 9.00% | 0.842 | 507 |
| 3 | 619 | 9.00% | 0.772 | 478 |
| 4 | 637 | 9.00% | 0.708 | 451 |
| 5 | 655 | 9.00% | 0.650 | 426 |
| 6 | 673 | 9.00% | 0.596 | 401 |
| 7 | 692 | 9.00% | 0.547 | 379 |
| 8 | 711 | 9.00% | 0.502 | 357 |
| 9 | 731 | 9.00% | 0.460 | 336 |
| 10 | 752 | 9.00% | 0.422 | 317 |
| Terminal Value | 10,657 | 8.00% | 0.422 | 4,504 |

**Total Present Value = $7,263 million**

Subtracting debt (based on reported values in filings, representing approximately $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2022) and adding cash and investments ($611 million) yields a total equity value of **$4.45 billion**. 


**Risks and Considerations:**

* **Competition:** The LNG market is becoming increasingly competitive, and CQP may face pricing pressure and declining utilization rates in the future. The company is geographically concentrated in the US, so diversification may offer significant upside to investors.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in government regulations could impact CQP's business. This risk has come up in several filings by the company, and it has been restated and revisited in the Q4 2023 10-K report in January 2024 as well.
* **Execution Risk:**  There is execution risk associated with their expansion projects and the company's ability to achieve cost optimization targets.
* **Debt:** Although it is currently at 34%, increasing interest rates could increase debt burden further.

**Final Thoughts:** 

CQP is a company with a narrow moat operating in a growing industry. Their long-term contracts provide some degree of stability, but they are exposed to competitive and regulatory risks. The management team has industry experience, but their track record has been mixed.  Our DCF valuation suggests that the company is fairly priced at its current market capitalization.  Given the competitive landscape and potential risks, we have a somewhat pessimistic outlook on the company's long-term prospects. However, the long-term potential growth of LNG may make CQP an interesting investment for long-term investors with a high tolerance for risk and volatility.  The market also seems to be more risk-averse than overly optimistic about CQP’s potential.
