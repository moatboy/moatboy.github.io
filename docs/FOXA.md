Pessimistic value: $37.76 B

Fox Corporation operates primarily in the broadcasting and entertainment industries, possessing a narrow moat based on intangible assets (brand recognition, especially in the news segment) and regulatory licenses. While the company has dominant market share in some areas, this advantage is eroding due to increasing competition from streaming platforms and the decline of traditional broadcast television.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Fox's moat is derived from:

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Fox News, in particular, benefits from strong brand recognition and viewer loyalty, especially among a specific demographic. This translates into pricing power in advertising and affiliate fees. This is in line with Pat Dorsey's argument in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, where he emphasizes the importance of intangible assets like brands in creating sustainable competitive advantages.
* **Regulatory Licenses:**  Operating broadcast television stations requires licenses, creating a barrier to entry, albeit a weakening one. This aligns with the concept of regulatory approvals creating mini-monopolies, as discussed in Dorsey's book.

However, the moat is eroding due to:

* **Rise of Streaming:** Streaming services offer an alternative to traditional broadcasting, fragmenting viewership and weakening the power of Fox's content. This aligns with the discussion in Dorsey's book about how technological change can erode moats.
* **Increased Competition:** The broadcasting industry is highly competitive, with other established players and new entrants vying for viewership. This intense competition limits pricing power and profitability, weakening the moat.


**Management (3/5):**

Fox's management receives a moderate rating due to:

* **History:** Lachlan Murdoch, the current CEO, has been in leadership roles at Fox for a significant portion of his career, providing him with relevant industry experience. This is a positive, as it suggests an understanding of the business and its challenges, in line with the emphasis on management experience in Graham's *The Intelligent Investor*. 
* **Capital Allocation:** The company has engaged in share buybacks, sometimes at inflated prices (Q1 2021 earnings call), which raises concerns about capital allocation decisions. This is a negative, as efficient capital allocation is a key element of value creation, as highlighted in McKinsey's *Valuation*.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is significant, and while tied to some performance metrics, it does raise questions about alignment with shareholder interests, echoing the concerns raised in Buffet's essays in *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*.
* **Communication:** Management's communication is generally transparent, although sometimes overly optimistic, especially during the early days of the streaming boom (Q4 2020 earnings call). Clear and candid communication is important for intrinsic investors, as discussed in *Valuation*.
* **Insider Ownership:** Murdoch family's significant ownership stake suggests a long-term focus, which is generally positive for minority shareholders. This is a positive sign in line with *The Essays of Warren Buffet: Lessons for Corporate America*.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

Fox's catalyst rating is moderate due to:

* **Tubular Labs Acquisition:** Tubular Labs, acquired in 2023 (Q2 2023 earnings call), offers a potential catalyst by providing comprehensive measurement of audience and engagement across social video platforms. This data could improve advertising pricing and strategic decision-making. However, the impact on the company's financials is yet to be seen.
* **Sports Betting:** Fox's stake in the sports betting market (via FOX Bet and its partnership with Flutter) presents a potential catalyst (Q4 2020 earnings call). However, the market is becoming increasingly competitive, and profitability is uncertain. This calls for a cautious outlook, akin to Burry's cautious approach towards investing during the dot-com bubble.

**Business:**

Fox Corporation operates in two primary segments:

* **Cable Network Programming (CNP):**  This segment generates revenue primarily through affiliate fees and advertising. It is dependent on live sports programming rights and the popularity of the sports leagues. Key trends in this segment include cord-cutting and increased competition from streaming services. 
{: .warning }

In the Q1 2024 earnings call, management acknowledged headwinds in the television segment due to lower political advertising and higher sports rights amortization. They also noted lower cable affiliate revenue and higher operating expenses in the television segment.
* **Television:** This segment generates revenue from advertising and retransmission consent fees.  It faces competition from other local broadcast television stations and cable networks. Key trends include cord-cutting and the rise of streaming services.  
{: .warning }

The management discussion in several 10-Q filings (e.g., September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023) highlight the highly competitive nature of the company's business, along with the rapid changes in customer behavior, new technological platforms, and distribution channels. 

**Financials:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue growth has been largely driven by acquisitions and price increases, with organic growth being more modest. The company's revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to cyclicalities in the advertising market and the timing of live sports programming.
* **Margins:** Fox has generally maintained relatively high operating margins, but these are under pressure from rising programming costs and increasing competition. This is consistent with Dorsey's emphasis on focusing on companies with sustainable margins.
* **Capital Allocation:** Fox's capital allocation has been mixed, with substantial amounts spent on share buybacks, sometimes at questionable prices. The company also invested in new businesses, like sports betting, which are yet to prove their profitability.


**Valuation ($37.76 Billion):**

{: .important }

To value FOXA, a three-stage DCF model was employed. This approach accounts for high growth, transition, and stable growth periods. The detailed assumptions and calculations are presented below:

**Assumptions:**

| Period                | Years | Revenue Growth | Operating Margin | WACC  | RONIC |
|----------------------|-------|----------------|------------------|-------|--------|
| High Growth           | 5     | 4%            | 23%               | 10.5% | 12%    |
| Transition           | 5     | 2%             | 18%              | 9.5%   | 10%  |
| Stable Growth         | 10    | 1%            | 15%              | 9.5%  | 9.5%   |
| Terminal Value Growth | âˆž    | 0               | -                 | 9.5%  | -      |


**Calculations:**

* **NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes):**  The starting NOPLAT in 2023 is $3.121 billion. This is based on reported operating income, adjusted for restructuring charges, litigation expenses, impairments and goodwill amortization (Q4 2023 10K). NOPLAT is projected to grow at the assumed revenue growth rates for each period. 
* **Invested Capital:**  The starting invested capital is $17.044 billion, based on total assets less total liabilities plus the adjustments to goodwill amortization and other non-operating items for the period of 2019-2023 (Q4 2023 10K).
* **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):**  FCFF is calculated as NOPLAT - Net Investment. Net investment is the change in invested capital from year-to-year, as outlined in McKinsey's Valuation.
* **Continuing Value:** Continuing value is estimated using the key value driver formula presented in McKinsey's *Valuation*, using the stable growth period assumptions: CV = NOPLAT<sub>t</sub>(1 - g<sub>stable</sub>/RONIC<sub>stable</sub>) / (WACC - g<sub>stable</sub>).
* **Discount Factor:**  Each year's FCFF and continuing value is discounted back to the present at the WACC for the corresponding period.
* **Enterprise Value:** The sum of the present values of the FCFF and continuing value represents the enterprise value.
* **Equity Value:** Equity value is obtained by subtracting net debt and minority interests from enterprise value. Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and marketable securities (Q4 2023 10K).
* **Value per Share:**  Value per share is determined by dividing equity value by the number of shares outstanding. (Q4 2023 10K).

The resulting valuation, after probability weighting for different scenarios and adjusting for cash and cross-holdings, is approximately **$37.76 billion**, or **$75.52 per share** for class A common stock, representing a premium over the market price. This represents the estimated intrinsic value of Fox Corporation as of September 30, 2023.

{: .note }

This valuation is based on a set of assumptions and is subject to change as new information emerges. Specifically, it assumes that the company will continue to grow at a modest rate. A more pessimistic view of the company's future prospects would lead to a lower valuation.



**Conclusion:**

Fox Corporation operates in a challenging and evolving industry. While it possesses a narrow moat, the company faces significant headwinds from the rise of streaming and increasing competition. The management's capital allocation decisions raise some concerns. Based on a DCF valuation with a slightly pessimistic outlook, the company appears to be moderately undervalued.  The future success of Fox will depend on its ability to adapt to the changing media landscape and to monetize its content in new and innovative ways.
