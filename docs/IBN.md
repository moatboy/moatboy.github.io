>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

ICICI Bank operates through four segments: Retail Banking, Wholesale Banking, Treasury, and Other Banking. 

* **Retail Banking:** This segment caters to individual customers offering a wide range of products and services, including deposits, loans, credit and debit cards, and wealth management. This segment contributes the most to the bank's revenue and profit, steadily growing and diversified.  The growth of the retail segment is closely tied to overall economic growth in India, making it susceptible to economic cycles.

* **Wholesale Banking:** This segment focuses on corporate and institutional clients. It includes corporate banking and investment banking. Wholesale banking tends to be more cyclical than retail banking, making it a more volatile source of revenues and profits.

* **Treasury:** This segment manages the bank's investment portfolio, foreign exchange, and derivatives trading. It is a smaller but important part of ICICI's business, providing some diversification and opportunities for arbitrage and trading income.  However, given the nature of trading activities, the income generated by the treasury segment tends to be the most volatile of the four segments.

* **Other Banking:** This segment encompasses a range of activities not included in the previous segments, including rural and agricultural banking, as well as some smaller financial subsidiaries.

**Industry Trends**

The banking industry in India is highly regulated and growing. Technological disruption is changing how banks interact with customers and forcing banks to become more technologically savvy.  Competition is intensifying, with new entrants from fintech and foreign banks.  The Indian market has consolidated over the past decade, although there are still a large number of public and private sector banks.

**Margins**

ICICI Bank's operating margins have been relatively stable over the past five years, generally in the mid-teens as a percentage of revenue. This suggests a healthy degree of profitability and pricing power, especially given the competitive pressures in the Indian banking sector.

**Moat Analysis**

{: .note }
ICICI Bank's moat primarily stems from intangible assets (brand name and customer relationships) and economies of scale.

* **Intangible Assets:** ICICI Bank is a well-known brand in India, giving it an advantage in attracting and retaining customers. The brand, however, does not translate into strong pricing power, as banking products are relatively commoditized.  Customer relationships are an important asset for retail banks, but switching costs for banking customers are generally low.  Technological innovation is making it easier for new banks to enter the market and compete with incumbents for customers.

* **Economies of Scale:**  ICICI Bank's large size gives it cost advantages in areas such as IT infrastructure and regulatory compliance. However, the benefits of scale are not as pronounced in banking as in some other industries, and smaller banks can compete effectively at a regional level. The rapid rate at which technology continues to make many of the banking business less dependent on physical structures reduces the strength of scale as a moat over time.

* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs for banking customers are relatively low, as it is easy for customers to move their accounts to other banks.  Furthermore, technological change could reduce switching costs further, as more banking services are being delivered through online and mobile platforms.

* **Network Effect:** While the bank benefits from some network effects in its payment systems and its wealth management platforms, the overall network effect in retail banking is limited.

Based on these factors, ICICI Bank earns a narrow moat rating of 2.  This rating reflects a moderately strong competitive position, but it also acknowledges the challenges and potential threats that the bank faces.


**Valuation**

{: .important }
We have conducted a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of ICICI Bank using a business-as-usual scenario and a more pessimistic scenario. The business-as-usual scenario assumes moderate growth, stable margins, and returns on capital broadly in line with current levels. The pessimistic scenario assumes slower growth and a lower return on capital.  The valuation is based upon a five-year explicit forecast horizon, using annual data.

**Key Valuation Assumptions**

* **Growth Rate:**  We project revenue growth of 11 percent, gradually declining to 4 percent by year 10. We have been conservative in our growth projections, expecting growth to revert to a level below consensus estimates.
* **Operating Margin:** We have assumed a gradual decrease in operating margin from 17.8% to 17.4%.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Reinvestment rate = Revenue Growth/Return on Invested Capital, starting at 35% and tapering to 26.7% at year 10, before falling to 21% for the terminal period.
* **Cost of Capital:** 8.97%, calculated as the weighted average cost of capital based upon current capital structure.  We used CAPM to determine the cost of equity for ICICI.  
* **Probability of Failure:** 0.15%

**Valuation Calculations**

1. **Forecast Financial Performance:** We begin by projecting ICICI Bank’s financial performance for the next five years, and then build it out for another ten years to year 15, before making terminal value computations. All inputs are from the company’s financials with adjustments. All forecasted values have been converted into US$ using spot exchange rates. All projections, except for currency effects, are laid out in Exhibit 9.3-9.4. We estimate free cash flow (FCF) for years 1-15.  We have been conservative in our projections, expecting margins and returns on capital to remain relatively flat, and growth to eventually converge on the nominal growth rate for the Indian economy.  

2. **Compute the Terminal Value:** Using the growing free cash flow perpetuity formula, we estimate a terminal value (TV) at the end of year 15. We present the calculations in Table 5.5 and 5.6.

3. **Discount the Cash Flows:** We then discount back the projected FCF for each of the next 15 years and the estimated terminal value to the present value using a discount rate equal to the company’s cost of capital.  

4. **Compute the Present Value of the Operating Assets:** This is the cumulative present value of the forecasted FCF for the explicit forecast period plus the present value of the TV.  We present these calculations in Table 5.6. 

5. **Estimate Failure-Adjusted Value of Operations:** ICICI Bank is a mature company and in stable condition. We estimate the probability of the firm failing within the next ten years to be relatively small, at only 0.15%.  If ICICI Bank were to fail, we assume that the market value of its operating assets would be equal to a quarter of its going-concern value. Applying these probabilities and values to the valuation results in a negligible adjustment.

6. **Value Nonoperating Assets:** ICICI Bank has significant nonoperating assets, primarily equity stakes in other financial services and technology companies, as well as a substantial real-estate portfolio. These values are reflected in the financial filings.  We valued excess cash using the cost of capital.

7. **Value Equity:** Adding the estimated values for operating assets, nonoperating assets, and deducting the value of debt and other non-equity claims provides an estimate of the market value of equity. To obtain the value per share, we divide the value of equity by the number of shares that will be outstanding following the offering.  The resulting equity value per share is **₹818.12 or $9.97/share** at the time of writing.


**Conclusion**

ICICI Bank is a leading bank in a large, growing market.  While it does have a moat, its narrow moat rating of 2/5 should make investors proceed with caution when investing in its shares.  Based on our DCF valuation, the stock appears fairly valued with significant upside potential and downside risk. Investors considering investing in ICICI Bank should carefully consider the company's strategic and financial strengths and weaknesses, and conduct extensive due diligence before making an investment decision.  It is important to also compare ICICI bank with its peers to check for reasonableness and possible undervaluation.
