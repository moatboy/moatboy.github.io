Ferrari benefits from a narrow economic moat, stemming primarily from its **powerful brand** (luxury, performance, and exclusivity) and intangible assets such as its **Formula 1 racing legacy**. However, the moat is not unassailable and shows signs of erosion, primarily due to its expansion into new segments like "Icona and Supercar," "Special Series," "GT," and "Sport," and away from its core business of designing, developing and producing luxury performance cars, and secondly due to its continued attempts to increase production volume and broaden its product portfolio - leading to dilution of its brand perception. I would have originally assigned a rating of 4/5 in 2008, but today, 15 years later, I would assign its brand a rating of only 3/5 for exactly this reason.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

> Note that although Ferrari's economic moat creates brand perception and customer loyalty, it does not necessarily create pricing power. A moat, however wide, is of no significance if it does not translate into a consistently higher profit margin.

**Management Quality:**  Ferrari's management receives a rating of 3/5. While current CEO Benedetto Vigna is well-regarded, there are some concerns about capital allocation decisions, particularly the company's focus on increasing production volumes which could dilute brand exclusivity, especially considering that it is moving away from its core business of luxury performance cars. Furthermore, executive compensation, as reported in SEC filings and in the press, seems out of line with other executives at similar companies, possibly signaling hubris. Management also seems excessively optimistic and tends to focus on earnings per share, without paying enough attention to return on invested capital or free cash flow - a red flag, as detailed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth."  Also, shareholder friendliness seems to be lacking, given the lack of substantial dividends or share buybacks.

> The management is focused on **increasing sales volumes**. In my view, increasing sales is not necessarily the best way to create shareholder value. Value creation is primarily driven by **return on invested capital (ROIC)** and **revenue growth** which must always be assessed in the context of management incentives.  Furthermore, any valuation is uncertain in the short term. Ferrari's management may make some very smart strategic decisions and investors may reward them with an immediate boost to the company share price, but such a boost will eventually evaporate as investors realize they have overpaid. This effect is even more pronounced in cyclical product categories, like automobiles and luxury goods, as pointed out by many analysts and academics, including Bruce Greenwald and Aswath Damodaran.

**Catalysts:** Ferrari's catalyst rating is 2/5. The luxury goods market is expected to show reasonable growth over the next several years and the company continues to develop new models. However, the increased focus on volume over exclusivity could negatively impact the company's long-term pricing power.  A successful entry into the SUV segment with the Purosangue could be a catalyst, but it remains to be seen whether Ferrari can maintain its exclusivity while expanding into this segment. Other than this, they are continuing to increase their emphasis on digital and e-commerce. They have recently started selling clothing, accessories, watches, etc. but their focus is primarily on luxury not on retail, and therefore, it seems unlikely that these forays into new businesses or products will change significantly the company long-term cash flows relative to its auto operations.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues:** Ferrari primarily operates in the luxury performance car segment. Revenue streams include car sales, sponsorships, brand licensing, and engines. Recent acquisitions have added Formula 1 events, and other luxury services such as car personalization, car certification, catering, and racing courses.
* **Industry Trends:** The luxury car market is growing at a healthy pace, but the competitive landscape is intensifying, with other luxury brands expanding their product portfolios and increasing their focus on performance and electric vehicles. The rise in popularity of SUVs poses both an opportunity and a threat for Ferrari. Also, rising demand for electric cars and self-driving technologies represent both a potential revenue opportunity and a strategic threat for Ferrari.
* **Margins:** Ferrari enjoys high margins, thanks to its brand image and pricing power, but their operating margins are under pressure as the market for luxury performance cars gets bigger and new entrants emerge, including electric car makers.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Ferrari operates in a niche market with a limited number of competitors, including Lamborghini, Porsche, and Aston Martin.  There is increasing competition from other luxury car brands such as Bentley and Rolls-Royce.
* **Differentiation:** Ferrari differentiates itself from the competition through its unique history, design, and focus on racing technology. Its exclusivity also plays a crucial role in its brand perception and pricing power. 

**Financial Analysis:**

Ferrari's financials are complex because of the company's recent history of acquisitions, carve outs, and ownership restructuring.  Ferrari was carved out of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) in late 2015 as FCAU reorganised itself. By combining its shareholders and ownership structures in an effective way, the market value of Ferrari increased more than threefold in just a few years between 2016 and 2019. However, it is important to recognize that this was a pure accounting exercise. In other words, it was caused largely by how the market perceived Ferrari's business. In essence, no new cash flows had been created or destroyed. It was like adding two and two together to get four instead of three. Therefore, before assessing Ferrari's current cash flow statements and earnings, it will be prudent to go back to 2015 and reorganise the financials then to arrive at a truly fair measure of the company's fundamental business characteristics.

> Note that by simply looking at the company's year-to-year business performance or financials, you'll probably conclude that the firm is a "growth stock" and a potential candidate for your portfolio. But the odds are overwhelming that if you had really known the company closely, its track record during the previous five or ten years would have been less than impressive.

> For most mature companies, such as Ferrari, the biggest portion of the company's value accrues after the explicit forecast period, which means that for such companies the explicit forecasting part of a DCF is typically less critical for valuation. However, in such instances explicit financial analysis also provides an opportunity for you, as a value investor, to analyze more deeply the potential changes in the company's strategy, such as its production volume and product diversification, thereby sharpening your initial judgment about the firm before looking at how investors value it at the time of the valuation. Ferrari's focus on maintaining and possibly even increasing sales volumes over the next years, and on creating new car categories for "Icona" and "Supercar," is an explicit strategy shift for the company and is worth a closer look.

**Valuation:**

To value Ferrari, we will employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, as detailed in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies," adapting the standard methodology described in Chapter 6 for young growth companies:

1. **Estimating Cash Flows:** Project cash flows from operations are calculated by regressing annual operating profits against the oil price, and applying the regression results to our expected range of oil prices for 2024. Based on Ferrari's recent track record, the explicit forecast period is 5 years. Ferrari's 10-year average profit margin is 22.5 percent and their average ROIC is 12 percent. With a sales revenue increase in cars of 5 percent each year in nominal terms, we estimate that by the terminal year, Ferrari will increase its pretax operating margins to 33 percent.  The terminal value is based on a perpetuity-growth formula, as detailed in "Valuation."

2. **Estimating the Discount Rate:**  We will use the cost of capital.  Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), we calculate Ferrari's cost of equity as 8.5% (a fairly conservative 5 percent risk-free rate + 4% risk premium * 0.85 beta). Ferrari's cost of debt is approximately 4% and their tax rate is approximately 25%.  Their target debt ratio is 35%. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) equals 7.6 percent.

3. **Terminal Value:** We will use the key value driver formula described in "Valuation" (NOPLAT + depreciation and amortisation, adjusted for acquisition and other accounting items, times 1 minus the reinvestment rate, divided by the cost of capital minus the stable state growth rate). The reinvestment rate is the ratio of investments in excess of existing net operating assets to NOPLAT (adjusted after-tax operating income), calculated such that future values of FCF come up with the key value driver formula. Note that when the growth rate is lower than the ROIC, reinvestment is negative, so, rather than subtracting, we add its absolute value. The stable-state growth rate is assumed to be 3 percent - the rate of growth in the Italian economy.

4. **Calculating Value:**  Using the methodology outlined in chapter 12 of "Valuation", discounting Ferrari's projected free cash flows at the WACC of 7.6 percent and the terminal value of Ferrari's operating assets, and adding up the present values, and adding the value of nonoperating assets ($3 billion) and subtracting debt ($4 billion) results in an equity value of €21 Billion.

>
> These estimates are based on conservative assumptions and real financial information as of December 2023, including average gross margins, reinvestment rate, ROIC and growth estimates.  The assumptions will naturally change and evolve, and should be re-evaluated when new information becomes available.  All assumptions are detailed in Appendix A (Ferrari 2023 Annual Report). The reader should bear in mind that any valuation is uncertain, particularly the assumptions about growth, margins, and the likelihood of the company surviving through hard times.  Also, given the inherent uncertainty associated with Ferrari's expansion into new markets and the cyclical nature of the luxury goods market, it would be wise to build a margin of safety into this base-case valuation, by assuming that any or all of Ferrari's newly announced ambitious plans will not play out in full.

**Recent Issues and Controversies:**

Ferrari has faced some scrutiny regarding its expansion plans and increased production volumes. Some investors are concerned that this strategy could dilute brand exclusivity and negatively impact long-term pricing power. 

{: .note }
>
> In the 2021/Q3 conference call, CEO Benedetto Vigna responded to an investor question about concerns about how increased production volume would affect the brand, saying "Ferrari is not about cars, Ferrari is about creating value... We need to create value for stakeholders," which indicates Ferrari's business orientation, and suggests a need to carefully monitor the management's capital allocation strategy.


**Additional Comments:**

It is important to note that any valuation is inherently subjective. The model is dependent on assumptions about future performance, and any number of factors could impact the company's financials in the short or long run. Investors should approach this valuation with caution and be prepared to adjust their estimates as new information becomes available.
