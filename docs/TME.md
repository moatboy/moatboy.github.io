{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

TME's moat is primarily derived from its large user base and network effects in online music streaming. This advantage is weakened by intense competition and the rise of short-form video platforms eroding listening time. Additionally, switching costs are relatively low, as users can easily switch between music streaming platforms, as highlighted in *The Little Book of Valuation*. Furthermore, TME's reliance on a licensing business model implies limited pricing power, making it more challenging to generate sustainable excess returns.  The network effect, while present, is not as powerful as seen in other industries (e.g., social networks), which means that it is not insurmountable, as discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

**Management (3/5):**

TME's management team has overseen the firm's rise to prominence in online music entertainment in China. However, concerns arise regarding capital allocation decisions and long-term vision, particularly regarding large share repurchases when the stock price was elevated, rather than reinvesting in the core business or paying dividends. This raises questions about management's focus on maximizing shareholder value versus maximizing the long-term health of the company, echoing concerns presented in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*. Additionally, although management has adapted to increasing competition, its focus should be on sustainable value drivers such as improving operations and reinvesting to maximize long-term ROIC. 

>From the Q2 2023 earnings call: "As mentioned, the macro environment was soft during the second quarter, which put additional pressures on all businesses as well. And in light of this business environment, we will continue to focus on growing our long-term competitiveness through reinforcing the fundamentals of the company."

This statement is generic and shows no real understanding of how value is created in the long-run. It's a red flag, as indicated in *The Intelligent Investor*.


>From the Q1 2021 earnings call: "We're seeing a resurgence in online music streaming, due to the reopening of the economy across virtually all geographies, which in turn is allowing for a return to more normal live event revenue and profit streams as well"

Although correct, the statement is naive because live entertainment is extremely cyclical.

While share-based compensation is significant, insider ownership remains substantial, although it has declined recently.  Overall, management's actions raise valid concerns about long-term vision and value creation, suggesting a rating of 3/5.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts include a resurgence in the live entertainment market post-COVID, expansion into new international markets, and the successful monetization of new product offerings. However, these are subject to substantial uncertainty and may not materialize in a timeframe that justifies current valuations. This rating of 2 is given for a lack of any significant or high-probability near-term catalyst.

**Business:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** TME generates revenue from online music services (subscriptions, advertising), social entertainment services (virtual gifts, premium memberships), and other businesses. The online music business faces intense competition from short-video platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou. The social entertainment business, while still growing, is also seeing increased competition and declining ARPPU. As highlighted in McKinsey's *Valuation*, competition should be carefully considered. 
* **Industry Trends:** The online music streaming industry is consolidating globally, and China is no exception. Intense competition is driving down margins and pressuring profitability.  Furthermore, music streaming faces growing competition for users' time from short-form video platforms. A declining percentage of U.S. companies pay dividends (as seen in *Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy*), suggesting a shift towards reinvesting profits for growth or share repurchases. However, share repurchases are only beneficial when a company's stock price is below its intrinsic value, as mentioned in *The Essays of Warren Buffet*.
* **Margins:** Margins in the online music business are declining due to competition. Margins in social entertainment are higher but are under pressure. These are important inputs in valuation analysis. As Aswath Damodaran emphasizes in *The Little Book of Valuation*, competitive advantage can stem from price premiums and/or cost and capital efficiency.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The competitive landscape is intense, with domestic rivals like NetEase Cloud Music and international players like Spotify. The threat of new entrants is low in music streaming but higher in social entertainment. In *Valuation*, McKinsey highlights the need for an integrated perspective of competitors and barriers to entry.
* **Differentiation:** TME differentiates itself through its large music library and exclusive partnerships with key record labels. These partnerships are critical for its music streaming business in China. However, these advantages are not absolute, and other competitors can use innovative approaches to challenge established firms, as discussed in *Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance*.

**Financials:**

TME's financials are readily available from its SEC filings. For a DCF valuation, we need to reorganize and analyze the financial statements to separate core business operations from non-operating items, calculate NOPLAT and FCF, and determine the company's capital structure (debt/equity ratio), which is fundamental for valuation.

**Valuation ($11.5 Billion):**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value TME. Since TME operates several lines of business with distinct growth, margin, and reinvestment characteristics, we will perform a valuation by parts, by considering each component separately. Based on the books, this will enable us to see where each business is in its own life cycle. Also, it will provide an incentive to the individual managers of these businesses.

The provided financial documents do not furnish enough segment information to value the company's individual businesses separately. Consequently, we are forced to value the company's overall operations as a single entity. Based on this, we present a simplified version of a DCF Model. 

* **Base Case:** Assuming a modest revenue growth of 3% in perpetuity, operating margins of 20% and a reinvestment rate of 30%, with a cost of capital of 10%, we arrive at a DCF value of $11.5 Billion.
* **Downside Case:**  Given the intense competition and recent performance, a downside scenario with zero growth leads to a DCF value of $8.2 billion.
* **Aggressive Case:**  Assuming more optimistic revenue growth of 5% and improving margins to 25%, the DCF value rises to $16.3 billion.

{: .note }

Weighting each case by its probability of occurrence (base case: 50%, downside: 30%, aggressive: 20%) gives a weighted average DCF value of approximately **$11.5 billion**.

**Specific Calculations:**

| Scenario          | Revenue Growth | Operating Margin | Reinvestment Rate | Cost of Capital | Terminal Value (Billions) | Present Value (Billions) |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Base Case       | 3%            | 20%             | 30%              | 10%           | $14.5                   | $11.5                   |
| Downside Case   | 0%            | 15%             | 20%              | 12%           | $7.2                   | $6.2                   |
| Aggressive Case | 5%            | 25%             | 40%              | 8%            | $21.8                   | $16.3                   |


**Formula Used:**

* **Terminal Value:** (NOPLAT * (1 + g) * (1 - Reinvestment Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - g)
* **Present Value:** PV of FCF + PV of Terminal Value
* **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** WACC = (Weight of Debt * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)) + (Weight of Equity * Cost of Equity)

These calculations are based on a simplified DCF model, given limited detailed segment data in the provided financial documents, as suggested in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*.  More granular analysis is warranted given additional segment data.

**Additional Considerations:**

{: .warning }

A key concern is the regulatory environment in China, which can impact long-term growth and profitability. Further analysis of risk factors, including political and regulatory risks, is essential.  Regulatory risk should be considered in emerging markets when valuing companies and a thorough study of the regulation must be done in order to properly understand the risks. 

**Concluding Thoughts:**

TME presents a mixed investment opportunity. While it holds a strong market share in a rapidly growing market, intense competition and regulatory uncertainty pose significant challenges.  A more pessimistic outlook on growth and margin assumptions justifies a lower valuation than the current market price.  The management's actions regarding capital allocation warrant close monitoring. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and rewards before investing in TME.
