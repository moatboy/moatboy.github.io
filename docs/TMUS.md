>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

>Cost advantages and the network effect are significant, and these aren’t easily copied overnight, but they aren’t as sturdy as they seem on the surface.
>—Pat Dorsey, The Little Book That Builds Wealth

T-Mobile benefits from **cost advantages** stemming from its history as a scrappy underdog. It initially targeted less-price-sensitive customer segments, allowing it to undercut larger competitors on price. This also meant that it did not need the same network density as its larger rivals, resulting in a lower cost structure. However, as T-Mobile grows larger, these advantages are diminishing.  The company now faces more intense competition from other low-cost carriers and from larger players that have retooled their operations.

T-Mobile also benefits from a **network effect**. The company's extensive network allows it to serve more customers more efficiently, which makes it harder for smaller firms to compete. The value of the network increases with the number of subscribers, as each new subscriber benefits from the larger pool of users to connect with. The merger with Sprint significantly enhanced T-Mobile's network. However, the network effect is less powerful for companies like T-Mobile that operate in open networks (where users can switch between different service providers), unlike closed networks such as American Express or video game consoles.

**Management (3/5):**

* **History and Experience:** Management has a demonstrably successful track record, having taken T-Mobile from a struggling underdog to a leading wireless carrier.  They have executed well on acquisitions, network buildouts, and marketing. However, their emphasis on subscriber growth over profits—and the accounting gimmicks sometimes employed to achieve those growth targets—raises some concerns.

>Management matters...But the cold, hard truth is that some CEOs just have an easier job.
>—Pat Dorsey, The Little Book That Builds Wealth

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** T-Mobile's aggressive acquisition strategy is a double-edged sword. While the Sprint merger created value, some other large acquisitions have not been as successful. The company’s tendency to prioritize growth over profits can also lead to value destruction if the company invests in businesses where it lacks a competitive advantage.

>Acquisitions are good for the economy when they allocate resources more efficiently between owners.
>—McKinsey & Company, Valuation

* **Communication:** Management communicates regularly with investors through earnings calls and other forums, but often focuses on short-term metrics. Their communication is generally clear, but it can also be promotional at times.

* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:**  Executive compensation at T-Mobile is competitive, but not excessively so. Insider ownership is also at a reasonable level. 

* **Long-Term Focus:** The jury is still out on how effectively T-Mobile will be able to navigate an increasingly competitive landscape.  While the company’s current investments position it well for the near term, maintaining the pace of growth while preserving margins will be challenging.  Management’s ability to adapt and innovate will be critical.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **5G Rollout and Network Improvements:**  T-Mobile's 5G network and its continuing network improvements could be a source of competitive advantage for years to come. This could lead to greater market share and improved customer retention, which would boost the stock price. 
    >...our network is just getting better and better… we have more opportunity to add customers and continue to improve our cost structure and enhance shareholder value.
    >—Peter Osvaldik, President and CFO, Q2 2023 Earnings Call

* **Expansion into New Markets:** T-Mobile has been expanding into new geographic areas and introducing new service offerings, which could drive additional growth.
    >...we're adding share across pretty much all demographics. We're continuing to add ultra capacity to our network… and we're starting to turn on our standalone 5G services.
    >—Mike Sievert, President and CEO, Q2 2023 Earnings Call


**Valuation ($140 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was used, valuing the firm using free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), and considering the company’s risk profile and competitive position. A long-term growth rate and stable operating margin are assumed, reflecting the maturity of the wireless industry.

>Valuation levels for the stock market as a whole clearly reflect the underlying fundamental economic performance of the real economy.
>—McKinsey & Company, Valuation

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% annually (in line with expected long-term economic growth and slightly below historical organic growth in the sector)
* **Operating Margin:** 15% (below the company's current margin but reflecting increased competition and incorporating a moderate degree of pessimism)
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 8% (assuming modest increases in the cost of equity and cost of debt)


**Calculations:**

1. **Projected Free Cash Flow (FCFF):**  Using historical financials and applying a 2% growth rate and a 15% margin, project FCFF for the next 10 years.  
2. **Terminal Value:** Compute a terminal value at year 10.  I have used a perpetuity model, assuming cash flows will grow at a constant rate in perpetuity. 
3. **Present Value:** Discount the projected FCFF and the terminal value back to today's dollars using an 8% WACC.
4. **Non-Operating Assets:**  Add the value of non-operating assets. T-Mobile has limited non-operating assets and these are included in the valuation as part of operating assets for simplification.
5. **Debt:** Subtract the market value of debt and the value of debt equivalents.
6. **Equity Value:** Arrive at the value of equity and equity value per share.

Note: It is important to highlight that because T-Mobile is subject to ongoing spectrum auctions and is actively managing its capital structure (retaining earnings, issuing debt, making acquisitions, returning capital to its investors), these valuation calculations could change if any of these actions were undertaken or planned.


**Note:**

This valuation is based on a number of assumptions, and the actual value of the company could be higher or lower.  The inherent uncertainty associated with valuing any company is substantial, particularly so for a company with the characteristics of T-Mobile.  The margin of safety in a DCF model is your greatest friend and your worst enemy.  A wide spread in valuations by various analysts suggests there is room for error in this model. The market can also become disconnected from fundamentals as observed in 2000.

>In relative valuation, the market prices based on how similar assets are priced in the market...Valuation stories and numbers must play out.
