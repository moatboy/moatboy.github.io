>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


### Moat: 4/5

Costco's **wide moat** stems primarily from a combination of **cost advantages** and the **network effect**:

* **Cost Advantages:**  Costco leverages its massive scale to negotiate favorable pricing from its suppliers and operates efficiently with a focus on high sales volumes and low margins. This allows it to consistently offer lower prices than its competitors, as highlighted in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*.  Their business model of charging membership fees also contributes to this cost advantage by providing a steady stream of high-margin revenue, partially insulating the company from thin margins on merchandise sales, as mentioned in  *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*. Their quarterly reports consistently highlight increasing membership fees and renewal rates.
* **Network Effect:**  As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, the network effect is a powerful moat for companies like Costco. More members attract more suppliers, which allows Costco to offer a wider variety of merchandise and services at even lower prices. This, in turn, attracts more members, creating a virtuous cycle. The 10-K filings consistently show an increasing number of members and warehouses. Further, management often discusses increasing penetration in existing markets in their earnings calls, and opening new markets and new warehouses.

Costco's moat is not unassailable, and challenges do exist. The retail landscape is always evolving, as exemplified by the rise of e-commerce, which is being addressed by Costco through expansion of its online business as well. Competition, both domestically and internationally, remains intense. However, the durability of cost advantages and network effects make Costco's moat quite defensible. This is why we assign a rating of 4/5.

### Management: 3/5

* **Capital Allocation:** Management's capital allocation decisions have primarily focused on expanding warehouses and growing the company organically. Returns on invested capital have been impressive over the long term, averaging around 17%. However, more recently, ROIC has seen a mild decline. Further, there has been a growing emphasis on share buybacks which haven't always added value, as shown in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*.  This raises concerns about management's ability to allocate capital efficiently as growth slows down.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to performance metrics such as net sales growth and earnings. However, the absence of detailed disclosure of performance metrics in annual reports is a concern.  While executive compensation seems to be in line with peers, as noted by Counterpoint Global, specific numbers on executive compensation and returns on capital are lacking in 10-K filings. The lack of transparency is somewhat disconcerting.
* **Communication:**  Management provides fairly detailed information about current operations and results in its earnings calls. Quarterly financial disclosures are also reasonably detailed. However, a pessimistic investor might find management's comments about the future to be overly optimistic, and their emphasis on beating earnings targets is a bit worrying, as discussed in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*.  There have been some quarters, where there has been bad news, that is covered up by management.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is quite low at less than 1%. While this is common for larger companies, a more skeptical investor might prefer to see greater alignment between management and shareholders’ interests, as emphasized in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.

{: .warning }
Overall, Costco's management seems competent, but some factors like low insider ownership and lack of detailed disclosure in some areas keep us from giving a high rating.

### Catalyst: 2/5

* **International Expansion:** Costco continues to expand into new markets, primarily in Asia and Australia. These new markets have the potential to drive long-term growth, though building out infrastructure in these markets takes time, as discussed in management's comments in earnings calls.  Management often comments on increasing penetration in existing markets like Taiwan and China in earnings calls.
* **E-commerce:** Costco's e-commerce business is growing. This segment could become a more significant part of the business over time and enhance customer convenience, as exemplified by Amazon's success, as mentioned in Counterpoint Global’s report. However, this also might not be a meaningful driver of higher sales growth.
* **New Products and Services:** Costco continues to add new products and services, such as gasoline and more recently fresh foods, as mentioned in their earnings calls.  The potential for these products and services to have a big impact on overall profitability are slim.

The above catalysts may increase earnings over time, but the company is facing pressures from changing consumer behaviors and a challenging competitive landscape.  We therefore assign a catalyst rating of 2/5, indicating a limited near-term upside.

### Valuation: $220 Billion

We'll use a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, specifically the **free cash flow to the firm (FCFF)** approach discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation*. This approach is chosen because it removes the distortion caused by financial leverage and focuses on cash flows generated by operations.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% for the next 5 years and then 1% (terminal growth).
Given the maturity of the U.S. economy and retail sector, revenue growth is likely to be in the low single digits. We will use more conservative rates than what management projects in its discussions, as is our philosophy.
* **Operating Margin:** 3.5%, as per historical averages and in-line with current margin.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 30% declining to a stable growth rate of 10%.
Costco continues to reinvest in new warehouses and e-commerce; however, we are assuming a lower rate than the current rate as growth slows.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 7.5%.
This reflects a risk-free rate of 4%, a beta of 0.6 (obtained from regression against a global index), an equity risk premium of 4.5%, an after-tax cost of debt of 4%, and a 15/85 debt-to-equity ratio, in line with the company's current capital structure. The recent increasing financial leverage is likely to reverse itself to lower levels.

**Calculations:**

1. **FCFF:**  We'll use the following formula to compute free cash flow for the next 5 years:
FCFF = EBIT(1-t) + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Working Capital
Based on the financials, Costco generated about $8.8 billion in FCFF in the fiscal year 2023.
{: .highlight }

The current revenue growth rate is above 10%--which is unsustainable. Management claims the company is benefiting from a continued reopening recovery after the pandemic. However, they also comment on increased shopping frequency at existing stores. This could indicate some structural improvements, but needs to be monitored further.
{: .highlight }

2. **Terminal Value:**  We use a perpetuity growth model in conjunction with our conservative assumptions.
Terminal Value = FCFF(1+g)/(WACC-g)
3. **Present Value:**  Discount the FCFF for the next 5 years and the terminal value back to the present at the WACC of 7.5%.  We then add the present values to arrive at the total firm value. This firm value needs to be adjusted by adding back cash balances (excluding marketable securities), the value of non-operating assets, and subtracting debt and the value of any non-equity claims. 
{: .highlight }

As seen in the firm’s financial reports, Costco has purchased shares at much higher prices. However, as seen in the valuation books, this does not increase the value of the company for its existing shareholders. Repurchasing shares when the share price is overpriced is a very dubious value-adding activity.
{: .highlight }



Dividing the resulting value of equity by the number of shares outstanding yields a value per share.  Based on these conservative assumptions, we estimate a fair value of approximately $220 billion for Costco.

### Additional Comments and Recent Concerns

* **Inflation:** As highlighted by Aswath Damodaran, inflation can compress margins and impact profitability. Costco is particularly exposed to this risk, as evidenced in their earnings calls and in their annual reports, because grocery items are sensitive to price changes. However, as management indicated in recent earnings calls, the company seems to be navigating this environment effectively by selectively raising prices and also through effective supply chain management and cost controls.  They also comment on the increased volumes from higher shopping frequency from its members, although they do not quantify what portion of this increase stems from higher frequency and what portion stems from a continued reopening recovery.
* **Competition:** Competition from other warehouse clubs, traditional retailers, and e-commerce companies remains intense.  Management acknowledges this risk in its 10-K filings and comments on it in its earnings calls. They believe that their moat gives them an edge, as mentioned in the Counterpoint Global’s report. There has been a case, where there was some information leakage, that caused some of the company's suppliers to give some confidential information, which led to some of the company's new product developments. However, as seen in the recent earnings reports, they seem to be doing very well, so there does not seem to be any lingering adverse effects. Further, given our already fairly conservative estimates on revenues and operating margins, we do not need to build in any additional buffer or penalty for possible information leakage.
* **Cybersecurity Risks:**  Costco, like any other company that operates in an online environment, is susceptible to cybersecurity threats.  The company acknowledges these risks in its 10-K filings. However, there haven't been any major cybersecurity breaches reported in recent years.  They also claim to have the resources and processes in place to minimize these risks.
