{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

GPN possesses elements of a narrow moat, primarily derived from high switching costs, network effects, and economies of scale.

* **Switching Costs:** Merchant payment processors are integrated into a business's operations. Changing providers requires time, effort, and resources to transition contracts, retrain employees, and test new systems.  This creates stickiness, discouraging merchants from switching, which is further reinforced by the fact that the cost of switching is small in relation to the potential disruption of payments.
* **Network Effects:**  GPN benefits from network effects, particularly within its specific verticals. Its value proposition strengthens as more merchants and consumers use its platform, similar to Visa and Mastercard. More users mean greater volume, more volume means greater purchasing power, and greater purchasing power results in lower prices for merchants. Thus, as the company gains more merchants, it becomes more attractive to new ones. This dynamic generates natural monopolies and oligopolies.
* **Economies of Scale:**  As a large payment processor, GPN benefits from economies of scale, especially in sourcing, negotiating, and distributing its products.  Larger size results in lower average costs for a company when fixed costs and variable costs relative to total costs are large. GPN has very large operating income per branch. This type of cost advantage can be highly durable, however, is not as strong as the above two moat sources.

However, GPN's moat is not without its weaknesses:

* **Competition:** The industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with large players like Fiserv, Fidelity National Information Services, and new entrants consistently vying for market share.  This intense competition can put downward pressure on pricing and profitability. GPN management recognizes the threat of competition and are taking steps to protect the company's position including providing the company's differentiated offerings with a strong emphasis on pricing and value (2021 10-K). 
* **Technological Disruption:** Rapid technological change can erode competitive advantages. As GPN's moat is based in part on its technology, it must continuously adapt to avoid falling prey to newcomers offering better solutions at lower cost.  The company mentions the importance of evolving and adapting business models to changing competitive pressures (2023 Q1 Earnings Call).

**Management (3/5):**

GPN's management receives a mixed assessment, warranting a cautious outlook.

* **History and Experience:**  GPN management has a decent track record over the past few years but it has hardly been exceptional. Their returns on invested capital have been largely driven by acquisitions and not so much by organic growth.  
* **Capital Allocation:** GPN's aggressive acquisition strategy has added to its size and revenue but not always its profitability. The Evo Payments acquisition increased earnings, but it is too soon to tell how well it has performed on a cumulative basis (2023 Q1 Earnings Call). Its previous purchase of Total System Services, however, delivered mixed results. Management seems to understand that acquisitions must ultimately be accretive and value-enhancing (2019 Q3 Earnings Call).
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears to be performance-linked, which is positive. However, there is a potential concern about the extent to which stock options and grants contribute to executive pay.  As Michael Burry pointed out, options can create a perverse incentive to pursue short-term stock price movements. 
* **Communication:** Management appears to be engaging with investors but has a tendency to focus on adjusted earnings and other non-GAAP measures, potentially obscuring the true economic performance. It's essential for them to balance positive messaging with candid disclosures, especially during difficult times, as noted by Warren Buffett (The Essays of Warren Buffett).
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is not exceptionally high, which might raise concerns about management's long-term commitment.  However, this is not a significant issue as intrinsic investors are not excessively concerned with the specific percentages of insider ownership (The Essays of Warren Buffett).

**Catalyst (2/5):**

There are no immediate, strong catalysts evident for substantial share price appreciation.

* **Emerging Markets:**  GPN has been expanding in faster-growing emerging markets (2023 Q2 Earnings Call).  However, country risk needs to be carefully considered in these markets, and its contribution to potential future growth is uncertain. Further growth into new emerging markets has to be carefully considered, especially given the recent devaluation of the Argentine peso.
* **New Products/Services:** The company is investing in new services, technology, and product innovation (2023 Q1 Earnings Call).  New products and services are the highest value creators, however, new entrants often struggle to maintain profitability, and achieving profitability and sustaining growth becomes increasingly challenging given intense competition from the incumbents.
* **Industry Consolidation:**  The payments sector is undergoing consolidation. Strategic acquisitions can be positive for the acquirer if synergies are realized and the purchase price is not excessive.  However, as Aswath Damodaran writes, acquisitions are challenging to value due to potential for overpaying, difficulty integrating the merged company, and relying upon overoptimistic synergy or revenue improvement assumptions.
* **Cost-Cutting:**  Management is focusing on streamlining and improving efficiency (2023 Q2 Earnings Call). These efforts could improve margins in the short term, however,  cost-cutting and increased efficiency efforts are notoriously difficult to sustain in competitive markets (The Little Book That Builds Wealth).

**Valuation ($31.4 Billion):**

A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, using a five-year explicit forecast period, was employed to estimate GPN's intrinsic value. The DCF approach is the most appropriate for valuing banks because the operational and financial cash flows of these organizations cannot be separated (Valuation, McKinsey & Company). Given the heightened uncertainty in the market, we will adopt a pessimistic outlook.  

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** A modest 1 percent annual growth rate was used, given the mature nature of the business and increasing industry competition.  
* **Target Operating Margin:** A target operating margin of 20 percent was used based on industry averages and assuming the company would succeed in its stated plans for margin improvement.
* **Sales/Capital Ratio:** A conservative ratio of 0.7 was employed, reflecting reduced capital expenditures compared to the historical rate, and considering management's focus on return on invested capital.
* **Tax Rate:** 25 percent was assumed.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  Starting at 7.3 percent for the first three years (based on a 4 percent risk-free rate, 1.22 beta and 5.4 percent equity risk premium,  25 percent marginal tax rate and using the company's current financial statements data).
* **Terminal Value:** Assuming a 3 percent terminal growth rate, consistent with a mature, stable company in a moderately growing economy.

{: .note }

Note: These assumptions were chosen on the conservative side, reflecting industry pressures, competition, and global economic uncertainty. The rationale for these specific numbers stems from a blend of historical data, industry trends, management’s own statements in its earnings calls, and the principles detailed in "Valuation" by McKinsey & Company and "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham.

**Calculations:**

1. **NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes) Forecast:**  Projected out for the next five years using the revenue growth and margin assumptions. 
2. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Forecast:** Calculated as NOPLAT – Net Investment (Change in invested capital).
3. **Present Value of FCF:**  Each year's FCF was discounted back to the present using the WACC.
4. **Continuing Value (CV):**  Calculated using the terminal value formula (CV = FCF<sub>terminal year</sub> * (1+g) / (WACC - g)).
5. **Present Value of CV:** Discounted back to present using WACC.
6. **Enterprise Value:** The sum of the present values of FCF and CV.
7. **Equity Value:** Enterprise value, less the market value of debt and other non-equity claims (minority interests, employee stock options).
8. **Fair Value per Share:** Equity value divided by the number of shares outstanding.

| Year | Revenue ($M) | Operating Margin (%) |  NOPLAT ($M) | Net Investment ($M) | FCF ($M) | PV of FCF ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2024 | 13,837 | 20.0% | 2,767 | 310 | 2,457 | 1,710 |
| 2025 | 14,016 | 20.0% | 2,803 | 315 | 2,488 | 1,631 |

| 2027 | 14,379 | 20.0% | 2,876 | 324 | 2,552 | 1,480 |

**Adjustments:**

Subsequent to this, adjustments were made for cash and cash equivalents of $1,413 million, nonoperating assets of $1,103 million, debt of $11,526 million and minority interest of $879 million (as per financials of December 31, 2023). The result was a total equity value of $19,684 million.  

**Final Value:** Dividing the equity value by diluted shares outstanding (212.4 million) provided a value per share of $92.67 and a total market capitalization of **$19.7 billion**


**Additional Considerations:**

* GPN operates in a rapidly changing industry landscape. The rise of fintech, mobile payments, and other payment technologies pose both opportunities and threats. The company's ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial to its future success. They mention that they are taking a structured approach to managing the portfolio across cash, bonds and equities (2023 Q2 Earnings Call).
* Regulatory changes and government intervention can significantly impact the payments industry.  Recent regulatory actions regarding data privacy, security, and interchange fees should be factored into the valuation.   
* The company's recent acquisition of Evo Payments should also be considered, although it is too early to fully assess its long-term impact.  

**Conclusion:**

Despite the uncertainties surrounding the payments industry and GPN's competitive landscape, the company's current market valuation seems broadly in line with its intrinsic value. Given the pessimistic assumptions employed in this valuation, there appears to be a small margin of safety for a long-term investor.  The company's future performance will be driven by its ability to navigate industry changes, integrate acquisitions successfully, and capitalize on growth opportunities in emerging markets. Given the lack of strong catalysts, and a competitive industry landscape, I would refrain from giving a higher catalyst score for the company.
