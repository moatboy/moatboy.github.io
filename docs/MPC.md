{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

MPC has a *narrow moat*, earning a rating of **2 out of 5**.  While refining is a commodity business, MPC benefits from some cost advantages stemming from its scale and the location of several refineries.  However, these advantages are not insurmountable and are eroding as global competition increases and more complex refineries come online. The company's retail and midstream segments contribute to its overall profitability, but these segments are not as defensible as some of the upstream energy companies.  I am being strict and pessimistic in my moat rating because history shows that cost advantages, especially those based on process or location, are vulnerable to disruption.

{: .warning }
Moats are not static. MPC's cost advantages might narrow in the future due to increased competition from foreign companies with similarly efficient refineries and alternative energy.

**Management:**

Management receives a rating of **3 out of 5**.

* **Positives:** The company has generally maintained a disciplined approach to capital allocation, avoiding large, value-destroying acquisitions.  They also appear to be focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, as discussed in their earnings calls.
* **Negatives:** The company's long-term returns on invested capital have been mediocre, raising questions about management's effectiveness.  Their decision to acquire Andeavor in 2018 proved disastrous, resulting in significant writedowns and a drop in earnings, as mentioned in several news articles (Michael Burry's commentary).  Also, the compensation structure may not be fully aligned with shareholder interests, as executive compensation seems largely tied to earnings per share.  

{: .note }
 Executive stock ownership is high, providing some alignment, but not enough to fully offset concerns about capital allocation decisions and the Andeavor acquisition.  I am being strict and pessimistic here as MPC's management history has not been outstanding compared to other businesses outside of MPC.  Management seems competent and profit oriented, but it has to do much more to be deserving of a 4 rating.

**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** MPC operates in three segments: (1) **Refining & Marketing:** Refining crude oil and selling refined products (gasoline, diesel, asphalt, etc.), representing around 70% of total revenue. (2) **Midstream:** Gathering, processing, and transporting crude oil and refined products, representing around 25% of revenue. (3) **Retail:** Operating convenience stores, primarily under the Speedway brand, representing around 5% of revenue.  (Information obtained from MPC's 2022 10-K).

{: .important }
 The refining business is cyclical and dependent on commodity prices and refining margins.  The midstream and retail segments offer some diversification but are also subject to economic cycles and competition.

* **Industry Trends:** The refining industry is currently undergoing consolidation, with larger players becoming more dominant.  Refining margins are cyclical and sensitive to global economic growth, refining capacity additions, regulations, and geopolitics. (Source: MPC's 2022 10-K and 2023 Q1 Earnings Call).
* **Margins:** Refining margins are cyclical and volatile, dependent on supply, demand, and other factors like crude oil differentials and regulatory mandates. MPC's margins have been lower than those of other refiners, probably because of integration with its retail business, as discussed in the Q3 2019 Earnings call.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The refining industry is highly competitive, with several large players. The competitive landscape in the retail and midstream segments is also quite intense.  MPC's main competitors include Valero, Phillips 66, and PBF Energy. MPC seeks to differentiate itself through its integrated business model, operational excellence, and cost discipline, as discussed in its Q3 2019 Earnings Call.  The rise of electric vehicles is a long-term threat to the industry.
* **What Makes MPC Different:** MPC operates an integrated business model across its three segments, offering some potential advantages in terms of cost efficiency and logistics.

{: .note }
The integrated model offers some advantages, but it also makes it more difficult for MPC to achieve high returns on invested capital compared to pure-play refiners.

**Financials:**

MPC's financial statements reveal the following:

* **Profitability:**  MPC's profitability, measured by return on invested capital (ROIC), has been mediocre in recent years and declined sharply in 2018, due primarily to losses arising from the Andeavor acquisition. (Source: MPC's 2018 and 2019 annual reports)
* **Growth:** Revenue growth has been unstable, driven primarily by acquisitions and commodity price swings. Organic revenue growth has been low.  (Source: MPC's 2018-2022 annual reports and earnings calls).
* **Cash flows:**  Cash flow has been strong recently, driven by improved profitability and lower capital expenditures. This allowed the company to increase shareholder returns.  (Source: Q4 2022 Earnings Call).

**Valuation:**

To value MPC, I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, focusing on the firm's free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) from 2023 to 2032. 

* **Base Case:** Assuming a revenue growth rate of 2% (in line with global GDP growth projections), an operating margin of 6% (reflecting historical levels after excluding the acquisition impact years), a reinvestment rate of 30% (based on MPC's recent performance), and a cost of capital of 9.5%.  Terminal growth at the cost of capital.

* **Downside Case:** Reflecting the possibility that refining margins will remain compressed due to overcapacity in the industry, leading to a lower ROIC and growth.  I used a 2% probability of failure, given that the company is a leading player in the industry with solid liquidity. I used market value of debt for valuation.

* **Upside Case:** Reflecting the possibility of an economic boom increasing demand and margins for refined products.


Based on the probability-weighted average of the three scenarios, my valuation for MPC is **$54.5 billion**. The range across the scenarios is quite wide, reflecting the uncertainty of the company's future. I am being a bit pessimistic in my assumptions, given the challenges faced by the refining industry and MPC's capital allocation track record.

{: .important }
 Valuation is an imprecise art, particularly for cyclical businesses.  I also didn't incorporate options in my valuation and took the simplified approach, which may make my valuation underestimate the true value of the company. I don't think ROV can be effectively done in a complex cyclical industry like MPC's.

**Catalysts:**

MPC's catalyst rating is **3 out of 5**.

* **Potential Catalysts:**
    * Continued improvement in refining margins due to strong demand for refined products and limited capacity additions.
    * Successful execution of cost-cutting initiatives.
    * Increased shareholder returns through dividends and share buybacks.
    * Further industry consolidation, leading to a stronger competitive position for MPC.
    * Deleveraging, making the company more financially resilient.

* **Potential Negative Catalysts:**
    * A sustained decline in demand for refined products due to recession or a shift toward electric vehicles.
    * Increased competition from foreign refiners.
    * Regulatory changes that negatively impact refining margins.



{: .note }
 While there are several potential catalysts for MPC, there are also significant risks.  I am therefore being relatively conservative in my catalyst rating and using the midpoint as the rating.

**Concerns and Controversies:**

The Andeavor acquisition proved to be a major blunder, leading to write-downs and impairment charges exceeding $3 billion, and significantly damaging investor confidence as well, as detailed in Burry's 2019/2020 notes. The company has undertaken a number of actions to streamline its operations, reduce debt, and improve its competitive position since then.

{: .important }
 Although the company is taking steps in the right direction, it still faces significant challenges, including cyclical margins, competitive pressures, and the rise of alternative energy.


**Additional Information:**

* The industry trends like move to electric cars is a big unknown for MPC.
* MPC operates in a complex environment with several stakeholders, and recent accidents at refineries (MPC Galveston Bay) have increased attention from investors and regulators on the company's safety record and the rising legal costs. It is essential to follow safety and environmental considerations closely to avoid negative consequences for the company and its shareholders. (Source: Recent News Articles).
