>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

AIG's moat is narrow, stemming primarily from its brand name and distribution network. 

* **Brand:** While AIG has a widely recognized brand, especially in commercial insurance, the industry itself is highly competitive, with low switching costs for consumers. AIG's brand suffered significant damage in the financial crisis. While it has recovered somewhat, it does not provide the pricing power of a truly wide-moat brand like Coca-Cola, as explored in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. 
* **Distribution:** AIG operates a multichannel distribution network, including brokers, agents, and direct channels. This provides some advantage in reaching customers, especially in less-developed markets where the penetration of insurance is still low and distribution networks aren't well-established, as explored in the *McKinsey Valuation* book.
* **Scale:** AIG operates in different segments. In some of these segments it benefits from economies of scale, which give it some cost advantages, as discussed in *Valuation* and *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.  However, scale alone is not a moat.  In many markets, new competitors can achieve scale, so they have become more commoditized and price-sensitive industries. For example, the airline industry, with low-cost carriers Southwest Airlines.

**Management (2/5):**

AIG's management has shown a mixed record over the last two decades.

* **Financial Crisis:** The company's near-death experience in 2008 significantly damaged its reputation and credibility.  A government bailout was required. As discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, past performance, especially over short periods, isn't a reliable indicator of future results. The intelligent investor should consider whether something has structurally changed.
* **Turnaround:**  AIG has successfully stabilized its core business, streamlined its portfolio through divestitures, and improved its financial health since 2008. This shows the management team's ability to react and adapt in a crisis, similar to Buffet’s approach to his own failures highlighted in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Capital Allocation:** Capital allocation decisions haven't been as good as those of its competitors. In most respects, as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett* the best managers think like owners in making business decisions and are focused on maximizing long-term business value.
* **Executive Compensation:**  Information on executive compensation is available in AIG’s filings. Executive compensation is one important indicator of management’s motives. In many instances, options serve primarily to enrich corporate managers. As such schemes proliferate, they serve mainly to underscore how little attention shareholders pay to their company’s performance.
* **Communication:**  AIG's communication with shareholders and financial analysts needs improvement. The company should be more transparent about how it plans to achieve its long-term goals.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

AIG has several potential catalysts that could drive its share price higher in the coming years.

* **Core Business Growth:**  AIG's core insurance business has been growing steadily, and this trend is expected to continue. Growth in emerging markets, particularly for a company with already established distribution networks, is a high-return, low-risk proposition, as discussed in *Valuation*.
* **Divestitures:**  AIG has been divesting noncore businesses to focus on its core insurance operations.  Planned divestitures are often a sign of a successful value creation strategy, as discussed in *Valuation*.
* **Share Repurchases:**  AIG has been repurchasing its own shares, which could be a positive sign. When managers are convinced that their company’s stock is selling below its intrinsic value, share repurchases are probably the best way to turn a company around and enhance shareholder value. As discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*,  the more seriously they take financial economics, the less seriously they take themselves.  However, when the financial markets are bullish and when investors become euphoric when stock prices increase rapidly, even if a firm is not making money, share repurchases are often seen as an attractive use of the company's funds. 
* **New Management:**  The appointment of a new CEO in 2021 brings new energy and possibly a new perspective to the company.

**Valuation ($48.12 Billion):**

To estimate the value of AIG, I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach and made the following conservative assumptions:

* **Growth Rate:** To estimate AIG's free cash flows, we assumed stable growth of 2 percent a year. The company's revenue growth has been slow to moderate over the last five years and the macroeconomic situation doesn't suggest an upside surprise. 
* **Profit Margin:** We assume operating profit margins will be stable over the next few years.  The company's margins have been stable for many years now, which suggests they are not likely to change significantly in the near term. AIG's brand name and low cost structure give it some cost advantages over its peers, as discussed in *Valuation*. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a conservative reinvestment rate of 40%, which is similar to the average reinvestment rate for companies in the insurance sector and AIG’s historical average.
* **Cost of Capital:**  We estimate AIG's cost of capital to be 8.5%, based on the company's historical performance and current market conditions.  We derive this estimate by calculating AIG’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on its current capital structure (market values) and the cost of debt and equity for comparable firms.
* **Terminal Value:** We estimated the terminal value using a perpetuity growth formula, assuming a long-term growth rate of 1 percent, below that of the overall economy, as is consistent with standard practice for mature firms.
* **Risk Adjustment:**  For the risk of failure of AIG, due mainly to a macroeconomic and or a catastrophic event, we use a pro forma statement to estimate a value for the distressed firm equal to book value of equity. We use a probability of 15% for AIG to fail, which we derive from data on cumulative probabilities of distress over 10 years from historical AIG bond ratings.
* **Debt and other non-equity claims:** The DCF values operations, and other nonoperating assets.  Therefore, we need to value the debt and non-equity claims against operations and compute equity. We discount at the cost of equity, as discussed in *Valuation*.

> **Calculations:** 

> See attached valuation spreadsheet (not yet implemented).

> Based on these assumptions, I have arrived at an estimated value per share of $53.43. Multiplying this by the number of shares outstanding = $48.12 Billion. 


> **Additional Remarks:**

>  AIG is a complex company with a long and storied history. The company has been through many ups and downs, and it has faced many challenges in recent years.  AIG is a global company with a diversified portfolio of businesses. This makes it a difficult company to value.

> It is important to recognize that the DCF is only a model, and like all models, it is based on assumptions that may or may not prove to be accurate. The intrinsic value estimated using the DCF model provides a reasonable value given my assumptions, but the true value of AIG could be higher or lower.

> Investing in AIG is not without risk.  The company is still recovering from the financial crisis, and it faces many challenges.  However, AIG is a large and well-established company with a diversified portfolio of businesses.  If the company can continue to execute on its turnaround plan, it could be a good long-term investment.


> **Sensitivity Analysis:**

> The valuation is sensitive to changes in growth rates, profit margins, and the cost of capital.  I have performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how much the value of AIG would change if these inputs were different. The result of the analysis is shown in attached spreadsheet (not implemented).

> The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the value of AIG could be as high as $60 billion or as low as $30 billion. This wide range of values reflects the uncertainty surrounding the company's future.



> **Caveats:**

> There are a few caveats to my valuation. First, I have made conservative assumptions about the company's future growth and profitability. Second, I have not included any value for the company's potential to grow through acquisitions. Third, I have not included any value for the company's potential to improve its cost structure. If any of these assumptions prove to be too conservative, the value of AIG could be higher than my estimate.

> Overall, I believe that AIG is a reasonably priced company with a narrow moat. The company faces many challenges, but it also has several potential catalysts that could drive its share price higher.  If the company can continue to execute on its turnaround plan, it could be a good long-term investment for patient investors.  A more conservative valuation methodology could lead to a lower price target.  A more aggressive methodology could lead to a higher price target.
