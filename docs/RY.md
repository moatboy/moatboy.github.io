{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):** RY has a *narrow moat*, primarily derived from its substantial market share in Canada and some customer switching costs (as discussed in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth" by Pat Dorsey, customer switching costs can create a competitive advantage, although not always a durable one). Its large size also confers some scale advantages in its home market. However, the banking industry is generally competitive, limiting RY's pricing power and overall moat strength.  International expansion faces additional competitive challenges. Unlike some sectors discussed in "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" by Philip Fisher (like pharmaceuticals or specialized software), banking is susceptible to cyclical pressures and rapid technological change, thus limiting the durability of any advantage.

**Management (3/5):** RY's management receives a middling rating due to a combination of factors.

* **Positive:** They've maintained a focus on consistent dividend payments (Graham emphasizes the importance of dividends for the defensive investor in "The Intelligent Investor") and seem to allocate capital with a focus on sustaining existing businesses rather than aggressive growth into riskier areas.
* **Negative:**  Compensation structures, while not excessive, may not always be optimally aligned with long-term shareholder returns. Also, there is a risk that the firm's size and scale can create insularity in its decision-making process, similar to what is termed the “institutional imperative” in "The Essays of Warren Buffett." Recent underperformance in U.S. investment banking and capital markets, as highlighted in earnings calls (Q1 and Q2 2023), and the need for restructuring mentioned in the Q3 2023 earnings call raise some concerns about strategic execution, similar to Michael Burry's skeptical approach outlined in his writings.

**Catalyst (2/5):**  Potential catalysts for RY include a broader economic recovery, especially in the U.S., and continued success in wealth management. Restructuring in capital markets and U.S. investment banking may also yield some gains, but this is a "show-me" story as the management admitted (Q3 2023 earnings call). As discussed by Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels in "Valuation", successful restructuring is not always straightforward and can sometimes result in more value destruction. Also, there is a real possibility of rising loan losses as interest rates continue to be high. Hence, I'm applying a conservative catalyst rating.

**Valuation ($115 Billion):**

**Method:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) as discussed in "Valuation" by Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels. This is the most robust method available, particularly for financial institutions where book value can be misleading.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% for the next 5 years, declining to 2% in perpetuity (pessimistic view given the macroeconomic headwinds and competitive landscape, as discussed in Q3 2023 earnings call).
* **Operating Margin:** 35% (in line with historical averages, but a slight decline from recent peaks reflecting margin pressure in several of the bank's businesses as highlighted in recent earnings calls).
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  10% for the next 5 years, declining to 5% in perpetuity (reflecting a commitment to maintaining the business rather than aggressive growth, as expressed by management).
* **Cost of Equity:** 9.00% (based on a risk-free rate of 3.80%, a beta of 0.82 (reflecting a slight discount compared to industry average, assuming a normalization to the pre-2008 levels as highlighted in the book "Valuation"), an equity risk premium of 5.70%, and a marginal tax rate of 25%).
* **Cost of Debt:**  4.27% (based on the yield on RY's debt adjusted for the marginal tax rate and probability of default, the likelihood of default remaining quite low). 
* **Target Capital Structure:** 15% debt and 85% equity (conservative, reflecting management's intent to reduce leverage given the heightened economic volatility, as highlighted in earnings calls (Q3 2023)).
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2% (in line with long-term economic growth expectations).
* **Discount Rate (WACC):** 8.0%


**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Projected FCF is derived based on revenue projections, margin assumptions, and reinvestment rates (see Table 1 below for detailed calculations). 
2. **Terminal Value:** Computed using the perpetuity growth method: 
   Terminal Value = (FCF<sub>11</sub> * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g).
3. **Present Value of FCF:** Each year's FCF is discounted back to the present value using the WACC.
4. **Enterprise Value (EV):** Sum of the present value of FCF and the present value of the terminal value.
5. **Equity Value:** EV – Net Debt + Cash.
6. **Fair Value per share:** Equity Value / Shares Outstanding.

> **Table 1: Free Cash Flow Projections (All amounts in USD millions)** | Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | Tax Rate | Reinvestment | FCF |
> |---|---|---|---|---|---|
> | 1 | 56,555 | 35.0% | 25.0% | 10.0% | 13,011 |
> | 2 | 58,252 | 35.0% | 25.0% | 10.0% | 13,493 |
> | 3 | 59,994 | 35.0% | 25.0% | 10.0% | 13,987 |
> | 4 | 61,783 | 35.0% | 25.0% | 10.0% | 14,495 |
> | 5 | 63,619 | 35.0% | 25.0% | 10.0% | 15,018 |
> | Terminal Value |  |  |  |  | 375,350 |


**Result:** Based on these assumptions, the approximate fair value for RY is around **$115 billion**. This valuation does not include any potential upside from unrealized gains on investments. However, given the recent downturn in several business segments and the potential for continued margin pressure and a possible increase in loan losses, this conservative valuation provides a margin of safety (a core concept of value investing as discussed in "Margin of Safety" by Seth Klarman).

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

As highlighted in recent earnings calls (Q1, Q2, Q3 2023) RY has faced challenges in its U.S. investment banking and capital markets business, necessitating restructuring. It has also encountered revenue declines and higher loan-loss provisions across several of its businesses, potentially exacerbated by rising interest rates.  The bank will likely face further regulatory scrutiny for its involvement in the recent TD-First Horizon acquisition deal's failure (Q2 2023 earnings call) - a reminder of how regulatory environment shifts can impact even large well-established companies, as discussed in "Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits" by Philip Fisher.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

A catalyst for RY would be a combination of an accelerated U.S. economic recovery coupled with a stabilization in its investment banking business (earnings calls (Q1, Q2 2023)).  Also, there may be further tailwinds from an unexpected decline in interest rates in the near future. These catalysts could lead to increased earnings and potentially higher valuations.
