>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

SCCO benefits from some cost advantages stemming from its ownership of low-cost mines (Minas Conga and Toquepala) with long reserve lives.  As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, location and unique resources can act as durable competitive advantages.  However, the "moat" around SCCO is narrow for several reasons:

1. **Commodity Business:** Copper is a commodity, making it difficult to differentiate product offerings and command pricing power. Customers primarily care about price.  This limits SCCO's ability to generate economic profits, as highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.
2. **Competition:**  Although SCCO is one of the largest copper producers, it faces competition from other large, well-financed firms.  This competition puts downward pressure on margins and returns on capital.
3. **Cyclicality:** Copper prices are subject to significant cyclical swings, making earnings volatile and less predictable.  As explained in *Valuation*, cyclical earnings make a company inherently riskier and reduce its intrinsic value.

**Management (2/5):**

While SCCO's management has overseen a period of growth, there are a number of concerns:

1. **Related-Party Transactions:**  SCCO has a history of related-party transactions. While these have been disclosed, they raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest and corporate governance, especially as the controlling shareholder is Grupo Mexico. As Warren Buffett cautions in his essays, transactions with related parties need to be assessed carefully.
2. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Concerns:**  The mining industry faces significant ESG risks, and SCCO is no exception. The company has faced controversies related to environmental damage and community relations. These issues can lead to substantial costs, regulatory intervention, and reputational damage, potentially hurting long-term value. As many valuation books mention, neglecting ESG factors can undermine long-term valuation.
3. **Capital Allocation:** While the company has engaged in significant capital projects, there are questions about the efficiency of these investments, especially with respect to returns on capital.  As Michael Burry mentions in *The Big Short*, a key aspect of successful management is the ability to allocate capital wisely.
4. **Dividend Policy:** SCCO has a history of paying dividends. It is our belief, however, that shareholders' interests would be better served by retaining nearly all the profits for reinvestment in the business or repurchasing shares as long as the company is earning high returns on capital.  As *The Essays of Warren Buffett* emphasizes, retained earnings must produce incremental benefits for shareholders to be justified.
5. **Limited Share Repurchases:** SCCO's share repurchases have been limited. We believe that share repurchases often provide the best way for companies to allocate capital, as they reduce share count, increasing intrinsic value for shareholders, as suggested by Buffet and Damodaran.
6. **Insider Ownership and Communication**: Although there is insider ownership through Grupo Mexico, public information doesn't reveal further details on management's stock ownership. Similarly, management's communication has been limited, especially with regard to long-term forecasts and business strategy, which limits the ability to get a firm grasp of their performance as managers.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

1. **Copper Prices:** SCCO's fortunes are tied to copper prices.  A sustained rise in copper prices, driven by increased demand for electric vehicles and infrastructure, could act as a significant catalyst.
2. **Operational Improvements:** The company has ongoing improvement programs.  Successful execution could boost margins and returns on capital.
3. **ESG Improvements:** Addressing ESG concerns and improving community relations could improve the company's reputation and reduce regulatory risk.
4. **New copper projects**: The company has a series of new copper projects that could drive long-term growth.
5. **New innovations** The company is investing in some new technology products which could be a catalyst
6. **Merger/Acquisition opportunity**: The company could be a takeover target which could be a catalyst

**Valuation ($42 Billion):**

To arrive at a fair value for SCCO, we employed a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, based on the methodology outlined in *Valuation*. We forecast a five-year revenue growth rate at the level of the US long-run economic growth rate over the next five years. We anticipate moderate improvement in operating margins.  Given SCCO's relatively low reinvestment needs, we estimated a reinvestment rate that reflects these improved operating margins, which reflects growth in capital expenditures in line with sales growth over the long-term. We assumed a long-term (10+ years) growth rate equal to the risk-free rate (U.S. 10-year T-Bond) plus inflation plus gross domestic product (GDP) growth. We use a relatively stable, long-term leverage structure of 15 percent debt. Given SCCO's market capitalization, its classification as an investment grade firm (rated BBB+ by S&P), and the conservative operating environment that management has historically favored, we assumed a cost of capital of 8.5%. We have chosen a stable cost of equity of 10% as a measure of risk, in order to take into account the volatile returns experienced by investors in SCCO over the past decade as indicated by its stock returns. 

{: .note }

We calculated SCCO's total invested capital (TIC) at approximately $12 billion as of December 2022. We forecast steady growth in free cash flows (FCFs) for the next 10 years, followed by a lower rate into perpetuity.  Based on this long-term perpetuity value and given their current annual FCF of $4.0 billion, the resulting intrinsic valuation of their operating assets would be about $44 billion. Adding the company's nonoperating assets, including cash and other investments, and subtracting outstanding debt gives an intrinsic valuation of their equity of about $42 billion.

{: .important }

It is important to note that we made several adjustments to the financial statements to arrive at a "clean surplus" measure of operating income, as advocated by Warren Buffett in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*. We eliminated the effects of foreign-currency translations and one-time charges, and we capitalized research and development.  This more accurately reflects the company's ongoing earnings power.  We also considered the possibility of failure, albeit at a fairly low 10 percent probability.  Furthermore, we assigned a relatively high perpetuity growth rate, and we used relatively low operating margins in our projections as a way of expressing a bit of pessimism.  Given our experience of previously seeing commodity firms, such as Norilsk Nickel, suffer sudden, unexpected, and dramatic reversals of fortune, we believe this conservative approach is warranted.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **China**: The company's exposure to China through its production facilities could be a source of both opportunity and risk.  A slowdown in Chinese economic growth could hurt copper demand, while infrastructure spending could boost it.
* **ESG**:  The company must continue to improve its ESG performance to reduce regulatory and reputational risks.
* **Technological disruption**:  Technological disruption is becoming a greater force in commodity-based industries, especially with increased emphasis on environmental sustainability.  This could create both opportunities and threats for SCCO.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies**:

* **Tia Maria Project**: This mine has faced repeated delays due to social and environmental concerns.  The ongoing social unrest in Peru further increases uncertainty around the Tia Maria project.  Resolution of these issues and successful execution of the project would be a significant positive catalyst, but failure to do so could weigh on the stock price. These ongoing delays represent management's sub-par performance.
* **Los Chancas Project:** This copper-molybdenum project was shelved back in 2014 due to opposition from the local community. It has been resurrected and revived with a restart of studies, but the timeline and details are still scarce. This project represents an upside potential catalyst. 
* **Copper Prices and Macroeconomic Uncertainty**: As discussed earlier, copper prices are cyclical and influenced by macroeconomic factors. The current global macroeconomic conditions present a significant headwind. A recession in the U.S. or Europe could result in a decline in copper prices, while continued infrastructure investment could increase demand and prices.

**It is critical to remember that even with a narrow moat and some management concerns, SCCO could be an attractive investment *if purchased at a sufficient margin of safety* below intrinsic value.** This requires a careful assessment of the company's risks and a disciplined approach to valuation. Given the current climate and the uncertain economic outlook, a healthy margin of safety would be essential to account for potential risks and uncertainties that this company faces.
