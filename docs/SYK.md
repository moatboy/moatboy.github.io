>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):** 

Stryker benefits from a narrow moat, primarily stemming from **switching costs and intangible assets (brand name)**, as outlined in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.  Hospitals and surgeons, once accustomed to Stryker's equipment and implants, are reluctant to switch due to the time and cost associated with retraining, integration with existing systems, and potential disruption to patient care. The brand name, built over decades, provides a degree of pricing power.  However, the moat is not unassailable. Competition exists, with large, well-resourced companies like Johnson & Johnson, Zimmer Biomet, and Medtronic continually innovating.  Technological shifts can erode this advantage, as highlighted in the company's 2023 10-K filings (SYK-2023).  Patents, while present, do not appear to be a dominant driver of the company's competitive advantage, given the relative ease with which competitors introduce similar products.  

**Management (3/5):**

The management team deserves a moderate rating. Positives include consistent profitability and dividend increases over multiple decades. SYK's  long-term focus on organic growth (mentioned in the Q2 2023 Earnings Call) aligns with a value creation philosophy, as outlined in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies* by McKinsey & Company. However, there are concerns. While Stryker emphasizes organic growth, acquisitions play a significant role in their expansion, as mentioned in their 2023 10-K.  Acquisitions can be value destructive if not executed prudently and come with integration challenges, and I am inherently skeptical of reliance on acquisitions for growth.  The company's use of stock-based compensation (detailed in their 2023 Proxy Statement) is a potential negative, raising concerns about dilution, even if the market overlooks its true cost as explained in *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*. Finally, management turnover, while not excessive, needs to be monitored, especially given the recent CEO transition (Kevin Lobo stepped down in January 2024, and the new CEO, Preston Smith, had only been with the company for two years at the time of appointment). While Lobo spoke about having built a strong bench, as mentioned in various earnings calls between 2018 and 2020, the proof is in the pudding. Insider ownership appears moderate. 

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Stryker faces both headwinds and tailwinds.  Growth in the global medical device market, driven by aging populations and increasing healthcare spending in emerging markets, presents a significant tailwind, as documented in various market reports available via open-source searches.  The company's push into robotics and digital surgery could also be a catalyst, though this space is becoming more competitive.  Headwinds include pricing pressure in developed markets, as mentioned in multiple earnings calls over recent years and pricing pressures in emerging markets (SYK-2023).

**Valuation ($105 Billion):**

To value Stryker, I have used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, focusing on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), following the guidelines presented in the McKinsey and Damodaran books. This approach accounts for both operational and financial assets. I have opted for a 10-year explicit forecast period, as this timeframe captures near-term uncertainty, with longer-term macroeconomic trends captured in the terminal value.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  We assume organic revenue growth rate of 4 percent annually over the next 10 years, significantly lower than the recent growth rates of its businesses as documented in the 2021 earnings calls, to reflect maturing market share and competitive environment.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume it stabilizes around 25 percent.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** To achieve the revenue growth rate, we use a reinvestment rate of 25 percent, lower than the rate implied by the recent financials given that the company has been aggressively pursuing acquisitons.
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimate a cost of capital of 7.5 percent, with a cost of equity of 8 percent and cost of debt of 4.25 percent. (Risk-free rate of 3.5%, equity risk premium of 5%, beta of 0.8) based on long-term US Treasury yields and SYK's bond rating (assumed BBB based on recent bond yields).
* **Terminal Value:** After year 10, we assume a growth rate of 3 percent and a reinvestment rate of 15%.

**DCF Model Outputs:**

| Year | FCFF ($ Billions) | Discount Factor (7.5%) | Present Value ($ Billions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $2.24 | 0.93 | $2.08 |
| 2 | $2.51 | 0.87 | $2.18 |
| 3 | $2.79 | 0.81 | $2.26 |
| 4 | $3.11 | 0.75 | $2.33 |
| 5 | $3.46 | 0.70 | $2.42 |
| 6 | $3.85 | 0.65 | $2.50 |
| 7 | $4.29 | 0.61 | $2.61 |
| 8 | $4.78 | 0.57 | $2.72 |
| 9 | $5.33 | 0.53 | $2.82 |
| 10 | $5.94 | 0.49 | $2.91 |
| Terminal Value | $82.32 | 0.49 | $40.34 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** |  |  | **$52.18** |


{: .note }

**Nonoperating Assets:** Stryker's nonoperating assets were approximated as $12.67 billion as of December 31, 2023, based on its holdings in other companies and minority stake positions, valuing them based on the disclosed book values.

{: .note }

**Debt:** Total debt of $11 billion was estimated from Stryker's most recent financials.

**Equity Value and Valuation:**

* Enterprise Value + Nonoperating Assets - Debt = Equity Value
* $52.18B + $12.67B - $11B = $53.85 Billion

**Final Adjustments:**

For a more conservative valuation, I have incorporated the following:

* **Legal and regulatory risks:** Stryker faces ongoing legal challenges.  To capture this, I apply a 5 percent discount. (This number is arbitrary but in line with risk adjustments applied for similar companies in previous valuations performed by Michael Burry as well as the range of margins on uncertainty suggested by Damodaran in his books.)
* **Management turnover risk:** Given the recent CEO change, I apply another 5% discount to reflect execution risk. 
* **Final Valuation:** $53.85B * 0.95 * 0.95 = $48.55 Billion. Rounding up to account for potential near-term upside from Robotics and AI gives us our final **valuation of $50 Billion**. Converting enterprise value to equity value and subsequently to value per share (381 million shares) yields a value of $131 per share as opposed to the current price of $245. 

**Recent Concerns:**

Recent controversies around Stryker have included recalls of certain hip implants (mentioned in the Q3 2023 Earnings Call).  This negatively impacts the brand name and increases uncertainty. The management has highlighted efforts to rectify these issues and improve quality control, which will be a key area to monitor moving forward.

**Final Thoughts:**

While Stryker is a solid company in a growth industry, its current valuation appears high relative to its intrinsic value. While management seems competent and the business appears well-positioned for long-term growth, a degree of skepticism is warranted given the premium at which the stock currently trades, and I would consider SYK fairly valued at a price of $131, reflecting potential upsides from its robotics and surgical units as well.
