>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Stryker operates in three primary segments: MedSurg, Neurotechnology and Spine, and Orthopaedics. As of 2023, MedSurg accounted for roughly 40% of sales, Orthopaedics for about 35%, and Neurotechnology and Spine for the remaining 25%. Geographically, the majority of Stryker’s revenues are generated from the Americas (primarily North America), with Europe and Asia accounting for smaller portions.
* **Industry Trends:** The medical technology industry is undergoing consolidation, driven by factors such as increased regulation, technological advancements, and pricing pressure. This has led to larger companies acquiring smaller players, creating a more concentrated market. While innovation is a key driver of growth, maintaining high margins is a challenge due to increased competition and commoditization of some products and services. The rise of value-based care is also influencing the industry, with a greater focus on outcomes and cost-effectiveness.
* **Margins:**  Stryker has historically generated healthy operating margins, typically above 20% of sales. However, recent trends show margin pressure due to intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. As of 2023, operating margins are closer to 17%.

**Moat Analysis:**

Stryker's moat is based on a combination of factors, with none being truly dominant. This warrants a moat rating of 3 out of 5.  

* **Intangible Assets:** Stryker benefits from a strong brand name, particularly in its core orthopedic and MedSurg segments. However, brand name alone is not enough to create a substantial moat in an industry where product innovation is rapid and commoditization is a constant threat. Patents play a minor role in Stryker’s moat, making them easy to ignore in moat analysis.

* **Switching Costs:**  In some product categories, such as medical instruments and surgical equipment, Stryker benefits from moderate switching costs due to the integration of its products into hospital systems and the training required for medical professionals. However, these switching costs are not insurmountable, and the increasing emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare may put pressure on these costs.

* **Network Effects:** Network effects are not a significant driver of Stryker’s moat.  While there are some benefits to having a large installed base of products (for training and maintenance), this is not as powerful as the network effects seen in other industries.

* **Cost Advantages:**  Stryker has some cost advantages due to its scale and efficient manufacturing capabilities. However, these advantages are not as significant as those seen in other industries, and they are constantly being challenged by competitors, both large and small.


> {: .warning } There are some concerns about the durability of Stryker’s moat. The medical technology industry is subject to rapid innovation, which can quickly erode competitive advantages.  The increasing emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare may also put pressure on margins and pricing.

**Valuation:**

> {: .important } **Method:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) with a two-stage model

> {: .important } **Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Consistent with its revenue generating track record from the last five years, the base case model assumes a revenue growth rate of 3% for 2024-2028 and then for the perpetuity. Given the market's current sluggishness we have decided to take a rather more conservative stance by assuming no revenue growth for the terminal valuation.
* **Margins:**  Margins are assumed to gradually improve from 17% to 20% over the next 10 years, reflecting management's cost-cutting initiatives and pricing power. However, the valuation assumes that margins would stay at their current level for the terminal valuation.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** The reinvestment rate is assumed to be 10% of after-tax operating income.
* **Cost of Capital:** 
    * Risk-free rate: 4.5% (10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate)
    * Equity risk premium: 6%
    * Beta: 1 (using adjusted industry average)
    * Cost of equity: 4.5% + 1 * 6% = 10.5%
    * Cost of debt: 3% (using the implied bond rate given SYK's credit rating)
    * Tax rate: 25%
    * Debt-to-equity ratio: 0.25
    * Cost of capital: 9.6% (calculated using the weighted average cost of capital formula)
* **Terminal Growth:** 0% (No-growth perpetuity assumption)


> {: .important } **Calculations:**

Using the two-stage DCF model, assuming after-tax operating income of $2.2 billion (2023), a discount rate of 9.6%, and no terminal growth yields a valuation of $44.5 billion for operating assets.

| Year | After-tax Operating Income | Discount Factor | PV |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $2.322 | 0.913 | $2.120 |
| 2 | $2.448 | 0.834 | $2.044 |
| 3 | $2.581 | 0.762 | $1.967 |
| 4 | $2.721 | 0.695 | $1.890 |
| 5 | $2.869 | 0.635 | $1.822 |
| 6- perpetuity |  |  | $22.671 |
| Total PV |  |  | $32.514 |

> {: .note } The total value of the company includes cash and short-term investments ($3.2 Billion), but we exclude equity investments ($0.5 Billion). We do not have any information on cross-holdings and acquisitions, nor any financial statement on leases and/or pensions, so we will assume their values are immaterial. In effect, we are computing an adjusted enterprise value. 

```
$32.5 billion (Operating Assets) + $3.2 Billion (Cash) - $0.5 Billion (Equity Investments) = $35 billion.
```

Rounding down to a value of **$35 billion** for a rather conservative estimate and then tripling it to get the value of the entire enterprise, leads us to a value of **$90 billion**, which is my final estimate of enterprise value (assuming a margin of safety).




> {: .note } Given the challenges in valuing growth companies, inherent uncertainties, and the tendency to overpay for growth, this valuation should be treated with caution.
