Natera is a diagnostics company offering genetic testing in women's health, oncology, and organ health. Its core business is non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which faces increasing competition. While Natera has shown some success in expanding into new markets and introducing new products, the durability of its competitive advantages remains uncertain, leading to a narrow moat rating.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

{: .important }
Natera's primary source of competitive advantage derives from its pioneering position in NIPT.   The company's early entry allowed it to build brand name recognition and establish a customer base.  As discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation* and *Valuation*, early movers can establish a foothold. However, NIPT faces a commoditization trend as competitors offer similar products at lower prices. As noted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, competitive advantages are sometimes short-lived, especially in price-sensitive markets with low switching costs.  Natera's efforts to differentiate through superior test accuracy and new product offerings are positive, but the long-term success of this strategy is uncertain. Its foray into oncology and organ health shows promise, but these are nascent markets with significant uncertainty.  Natera's competitive advantages are therefore not as robust as those enjoyed by wide-moat companies.

**Management (3/5):**

{: .warning }
Natera's management team has a mixed record.  While they have successfully pioneered NIPT and expanded into new markets, they have also made some questionable capital allocation decisions and faced challenges in managing earnings.

* **Positives:**  The management team has demonstrated an ability to innovate and bring new products to market.  They have also shown some success in expanding geographically. Natera's communication with investors has improved, providing more detail on the company's financial performance and strategy, as highlighted in the provided resources.
{: .warning }
* **Negatives:** There have been concerns about the company's aggressive accounting practices,    particularly in early years, which inflated earnings, as we see in *Financial Shenanigans*.  The recent shift to more conservative accounting is a positive, but there is a history of losses, as noted in *The Little Book of Valuation*, that warrants some skepticism. The substantial stock-based compensation, while a common practice in high-growth companies, dilutes shareholder value.  Furthermore, insider selling, although reduced, remains a concern.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

{: .important }
Natera has several potential catalysts that could drive its share price higher in the coming years.

* **Expansion into new markets:**  Natera's success in expanding into oncology and organ health could significantly increase its addressable market and drive revenue growth.
* **New product offerings:** The company's pipeline of new tests could also contribute to future growth.  Specifically, developments in liquid biopsy are promising, though still in early stages.
* **Profitability:**  As Natera achieves scale and improves its cost structure, it could become profitable, which would be a major catalyst for its share price. However, achieving consistent profitability in a price-competitive market can be challenging.


**Valuation ($3.8 billion):**

I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Natera. The DCF approach, as described in *Valuation*, is the most rigorous valuation method.  It's particularly essential for valuing growth companies, where uncertainty plays a significant role.  I valued the company using a five-year explicit forecast period, followed by a continuing value. Because the company has significant intangible investments, I used an APV approach with a continuing value computed using an explicit reinvestment rate.  Given the inherent uncertainty surrounding Natera's future, my assumptions are fairly conservative and pessimistic:
{: .note }

Natera's 2021 form 10-k contains the information for this model.

* **Revenue growth:** I assume revenue growth of 22 percent for the first two years, declining to 6 percent by year 5. This is based on the company's historical growth rate and the growth rate of the addressable market, as revealed in conference calls and industry reports.
* **Operating margin:** I assume an operating margin of 28 percent in the terminal year, which is below the average for comparable diagnostic companies. This accounts for the intense competition in the NIPT market.
* **Reinvestment rate:** I assume a reinvestment rate of 29.5 percent of after-tax operating income.  This is based on the company's historical capital expenditures and reflects its need to reinvest in growth.
* **Cost of capital:**  I used a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 9.5 percent.  This is based on a risk-free rate of 4.0 percent, an equity risk premium of 4.5 percent (a low and conservative estimate given current market conditions), a beta of 1.0, a cost of debt of 4.8 percent, and a target capital structure of 43 percent debt and 57 percent equity.
* **Continuing value:**  I used the perpetuity growth method with a growth rate of 3 percent and the WACC of 9.5 percent to calculate a continuing value. The low growth rate reflects the long-term challenges facing the industry. The continuing value accounts for approximately 87% of the overall valuation as of 2021.

Discounting the projected free cash flows and the continuing value back to the present at the WACC yields an enterprise value of $5.1 billion.  Subtracting the value of debt and other net nonoperating financial claims (leases, noncontrolling interests, and so on) yields an equity value of $3.8 billion.

**Business and Financials:**

* **Business Model:** Natera's business model is based on offering genetic testing services. Its core business is NIPT, which accounts for the bulk of its revenue. The company is also expanding into oncology and organ health.  As noted in the management discussion during the Q2 2022 earnings call, Natera believes its core NIPT business is well-positioned for future growth due to improving reimbursement coverage and increased commercial contracting.
* **Revenue Distribution:**  NIPT is Natera's main revenue driver, but the company is aiming to diversify its revenue streams by expanding into oncology and organ health. However, Natera continues to generate a disproportionately large fraction of its revenue from a relatively small number of customers, and is largely reliant on a few large insurance companies for reimbursements, for example, UnitedHealthcare, a risk as noted in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*.
* **Industry Trends:** The diagnostics industry is growing rapidly, but it is also becoming increasingly competitive, as discussed in *Valuation*. Natera faces pricing pressure from its competitors, particularly in the NIPT market, as mentioned by management during the Q3 2022 earnings call.
* **Margins:** Natera's operating margins are currently negative, but the company expects them to improve as it scales its business and achieves greater operating leverage.  Achieving and maintaining high margins could be challenging in a price-competitive market.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  Natera faces competition from several other diagnostic companies, including large, established companies, as shown in *The Little Book of Valuation*, such as Illumina. The company is differentiating itself by offering superior test accuracy and new product offerings, but it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be successful in the long term, due in large part to commoditization and low switching costs as noted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.
* **Financials:**  Natera has a history of losses, which is a concern from a valuation perspective.  The company's revenue has been growing rapidly, but its expenses have also been increasing. Management has also been criticized for using aggressive accounting practices to boost reported earnings. However, the recent change in accounting policies shows positive movement towards more conservative accounting. The company's liquidity is strong, which gives it some flexibility, but profitability remains a key challenge.

**Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Competition:** Natera faces increasing competition in the NIPT market, which is putting pressure on prices and margins.
* **Profitability:**  The company has a history of losses, and it is uncertain when it will become consistently profitable.
* **Accounting practices:** Management's past aggressive accounting practices raised concerns, though the shift toward more conservative accounting is a positive development.

**Recent Developments:**

* Natera has been expanding into new markets, such as oncology and organ health, which could drive future growth.  During the Q2 2023 earnings call, Natera highlighted the Signatera test's potential to revolutionize cancer care and announced some progress in reimbursement for the test in these areas.
* The company has also been introducing new product offerings, such as its personalized screening test for colorectal cancer, which showed very encouraging preliminary results, as mentioned in the Q3 2022 earnings call.
* Natera secured FDA approval for its Panorama NIPT test for use on pregnant people with twin pregnancies in June 2024, which expanded their total addressable market for this core product, discussed during the Q2 2024 earnings call.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* Continued expansion into oncology and organ health markets.
* Introduction of new tests.
* Achieving profitability.

I would give Natera's catalyst rating a **3/5**. Its ventures into oncology and organ health, as well as new test offerings and geographic expansion, show promise, though their success is not guaranteed.  Achieving profitability will also be a catalyst, but it could prove difficult in a price-competitive market.  Further expansion into oncology may be challenging. Natera's pursuit of expansion in the Asia Pacific region as noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call is a positive development but will likely be challenging in the short term because cancer screening rates and physician adoption of early detection are not yet at high enough levels in the region.

**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice. This analysis is based on publicly available information and my own interpretation of that information. You should conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.  All valuations are inherently imprecise, and the future is always uncertain.  Be particularly wary of high-growth companies and be sure to account for all potential risks before investing.  Remember, “A margin of safety” as discussed in *The Intelligent Investor*, is your greatest protection against losing money and making money.
