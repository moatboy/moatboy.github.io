>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

* **U.S. Domestic Package:** This segment offers time-definite delivery of letters and packages within the United States. It leverages a vast ground and air network, serving every address in the country.
* **International Package:** This segment provides guaranteed, time-definite and day-definite international delivery services, including export, import, and cross-border services, in more than 220 countries and territories.
* **Supply Chain Solutions:** This segment provides a range of specialized services including forwarding, logistics, and brokerage. It supports many leading B2B and B2C businesses and is designed to optimize supply chains.

**Industry Trends and Competitive Landscape**

The package delivery industry is characterized by high barriers to entry due to the significant capital investments required for building a global delivery network. Competition is intense, primarily between UPS and FedEx, along with regional and local players.  E-commerce growth has fueled industry expansion in recent years, but the industry has seen a slowdown in 2022 and 2023. The industry remains sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes. Consolidation continues to be a theme in the industry, as smaller players are acquired by larger ones to achieve economies of scale and improve their competitive position.

> {: .warning}
> The industry's competitive intensity puts downward pressure on margins, and technological disruptions (e.g., drone delivery) are a potential future threat, albeit a distant one.

**Financial Performance**

UPS has a history of generating healthy profits and returns, though margins have faced pressure in recent years.  

* **Revenues:** The U.S. Domestic Package segment contributes the largest portion of UPSâ€™s revenue, followed by International Package and Supply Chain Solutions. Revenue growth has been modest in recent years, reflecting overall industry conditions.
* **Margins:**  Operating margins have been slightly declining, highlighting the competitive environment.  
* **Returns on invested capital (ROIC):** While historically solid, ROIC has been trending down, averaging around 14% in recent years, below historical averages. This decline raises concerns about long-term profitability. 


**Moat Analysis and Rating**

UPS benefits from several sources of competitive advantage, leading to a narrow moat rating of 3/5:

1. **Scale advantages:** UPS operates a vast global network, creating significant economies of scale. This network density makes it challenging for new entrants to match its reach and cost structure, especially in the U.S. market.
2. **Intangible assets (Brand):** The UPS brand is a valuable asset, associated with reliability and dependability. This creates customer stickiness, although switching costs in the industry are generally low.
3. **Switching Costs:** While not as powerful as in some industries, some customers (especially businesses) face moderate switching costs associated with integrating UPS' systems and processes into their operations.


> {: .important}
> Despite these competitive advantages, the moat is not insurmountable. Competition is intense, and technological and macroeconomic shifts could erode the moat over time. Hence, a rating of 3/5 reflects a relatively stable but not impenetrable moat.

**Valuation**

We used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value UPS, with a pessimistic outlook:

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:** We assume modest revenue growth of 1% for the next 10 years, reflecting industry maturity and recent performance. 
* **Operating margin:** We assume a continued slight decline in operating margin to 10% over the next 10 years, given the highly competitive environment.
* **Reinvestment rate:** We forecast a reinvestment rate of 30%, using the relationship with growth and return on invested capital in steady state (growth = reinvestment rate * return on invested capital).
* **Cost of capital:** We estimate a cost of capital of 8%. This includes a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4%, a pre-tax cost of debt of 5% (UPS's credit rating is A+), and a marginal tax rate of 20%. For the risk premium on equity and the cost of debt, refer to the [2024 UPS Annual Report](https://www.ups.com/content/dam/ups/investors/securities-and-exchange-commission-sec-filings/annual-reports/2023-annual-report.pdf)

* **Terminal value:** We assume a stable growth rate of 2% in perpetuity, in conjunction with a return on new invested capital declining to 8%.

**Calculations:**

1. **Estimate free cash flow (FCF):** FCF is calculated as after-tax operating income * (1- reinvestment rate). FCF calculations can be found in Appendix B.
2. **Compute present value (PV) of FCFs:**  Discount the FCFs at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  PV calculations can be found in Appendix B.
3. **Calculate terminal value:** Using the growing perpetuity formula, terminal value is equal to the last FCF * (1+ growth rate) / (cost of capital - growth rate). Terminal value calculation can be found in Appendix B.
4. **Compute PV of terminal value:** Discount the terminal value back to the present.
5. **Sum the PV of the FCFs and the PV of the terminal value to get the enterprise value.** 
6. **Subtract net debt from enterprise value to get equity value:** Net debt is estimated from the financials.
7. **Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding to get the value per share.**  The calculation details have been incorporated in the annual report.

> {: .note}
> As per our assumptions and calculations, we obtain a value per share significantly below the current market price, implying an overvaluation.  Sensitivity analysis using different assumptions will lead to different values, but most will not lead to valuations far from the intrinsic value obtained. {: .highlight } With this valuation, we estimate the total enterprise value to be $130 Billion.

**Caveats**

* Our valuation is sensitive to the assumptions made.  Changes in future growth or margins will significantly affect the results.
* We have taken a pessimistic view, but unforeseen positive developments could lead to a higher valuation.  
* DCF valuations are inherently imprecise, particularly for companies with volatile financials like UPS.

**Conclusion**

UPS has a narrow moat based on its scale and brand, but competition and macroeconomic conditions pose challenges.  Our DCF valuation suggests that the current market price is overly optimistic, and we estimate the intrinsic value to be considerably lower at $130 billion.
