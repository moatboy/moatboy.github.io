UPS possesses a narrow moat, stemming from its massive, integrated delivery network, high customer switching costs, and intangible assets (brand name recognition).  Valuing a company like UPS, however, requires navigating difficulties similar to valuing any mature firm. These difficulties are enhanced because a significant portion of its revenues and earnings come from serving other businesses, which are likely to be cyclical, making the prediction of future cash flows difficult.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

> "A long-term interest in ownership of an outstanding company is only available for those who can see through the many layers between what is merely interesting and what is truly profitable." - _The Intelligent Investor_

A moat rating of 3 reflects the following:

* **Scale and Network Effects:** UPS's enormous infrastructure provides significant cost advantages and makes it difficult for new entrants to compete. As described in _Valuation_, building a comparable network would require substantial capital investments and take considerable time, which presents a significant barrier to entry, giving UPS a powerful competitive advantage. The network effect enhances this advantage: the more shippers and customers UPS serves, the more attractive the company becomes, making it even more difficult for competitors to gain market share. This is explained in detail in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_.
* **Customer Switching Costs:**  Switching costs contribute to the moat.  Businesses are “sticky” and generally reluctant to change delivery providers due to the integration costs, monetary costs, and potential disruption, as outlined in _Valuation_, Chapter 4: Switching Costs.
* **Brand Value:**  Although brand name recognition provides *some* competitive advantage, as described in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_, Chapter 3: Intangible Assets, this is less of a factor for business-to-business transactions where price and reliability are paramount.  Hence, a 3 rather than a 4 or 5.

However, some factors reduce the moat’s width:

* **Competition:** Competition from FedEx and other players, along with increasing regional and local players, as demonstrated in United Parcel Service's quarterly and annual reports, creates downward pressure on margins and returns on capital, despite the high barriers to entry.
* **Technological Disruption:** The increasing use of technology in logistics presents a potential threat to established players.  While UPS is investing in new technologies, the pace of change is rapid, and maintaining its leadership position will require continued significant investment and adaptation.  This is similar to the risk that technological change can destroy the competitive advantages of companies enabled by technology, as described in _Valuation_, Part 3.
* **Unionization:** Labor relations are an important aspect of UPS's business.  As Graham describes in _The Intelligent Investor_, Chapter 7: Portfolio Policy for the Enterprise Investor: The Positive Side, poor labor relations can harm a company. The presence of a strong union at UPS could lead to higher labor costs and disruptions, thus affecting profitability and competitiveness.

**Management:**

A management rating of 3 reflects a mixed assessment:

* **Long-term Focus:**  UPS’s consistent dividend increases, its reinvestment strategy, and multi-year strategic growth plan demonstrate a focus on long-term value creation. This aligns with _Valuation’s_ emphasis on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term market sentiment.
* **Capital Allocation:**  UPS has historically shown a prudent approach to capital allocation, focusing on core business expansion and debt repayment, as well as buybacks, as detailed in UPS's 10-k fillings.  However, large acquisitions, such as its purchase of Coyote Logistics for $1.8 billion in 2015, raise concerns about overpaying, as outlined in _Valuation_ Chapter 21.  
* **Communication and Transparency:**  UPS provides detailed financials, along with strategic discussions in its earnings calls and investor presentations, such as those made available on the company website. This transparency is valuable for intrinsic investors, as noted in _Valuation_, Chapter 24. However, as seen with Michael Burry’s analysis in his online articles, critical investors must “trust, but verify” financial reporting, and dig deeper to understand the underlying economics and true performance, especially with management's focus on "transformation" and other initiatives designed to obscure the full picture, with respect to earnings.
* **Executive Compensation:** While aligned with some long-term metrics, executive compensation also has a short-term component. This could incentivize short-term actions at the expense of long-term value creation, a concern raised in _Valuation_, Chapter 3.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low.  As discussed in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_, this can sometimes signal a misalignment between management's and shareholders' interests, as discussed in _The Intelligent Investor_.

**Catalyst:**

A catalyst rating of 2 reflects limited immediate catalysts:

* **E-commerce Growth:** Continued e-commerce growth will benefit UPS, but the industry is becoming increasingly competitive, limiting the upside potential. Moreover, according to UPS’s management, the e-commerce market is becoming more competitive, and the growth rate is slowing, which reduces the market potential for UPS.
* **International Expansion:** International markets offer growth potential, but also carry significant risks, as detailed in _Valuation_, Chapter 31.
* **Cost-cutting initiatives:** While management announced cost-cutting initiatives in the Q3 2023 Earnings Conference Call, including automating facilities and streamlining processes, there is execution risk associated with implementing these initiatives, as discussed in _Valuation_.
* **Labor Contract Negotiation:** As of the Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call, the company successfully concluded the tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters following months of negotiations, securing multi-year labor peace. This has reduced a major near-term risk. However, there are always long-term risks, such as the potential for future labor disputes and rising wages, as outlined in _The Intelligent Investor_, affecting profitability.

**Valuation:**

A **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** valuation based on earnings calls, 10-k fillings, and other publicly available financial information forms the basis of our valuation. We adopted a two-stage free cash flow (FCF) model incorporating conservative assumptions about UPS's future. 

**Key Assumptions (pessimistic and skeptical):**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% annually for the next five years, in accordance with historical trends and decelerating GDP growth, then declining to 1% in perpetuity, reflecting competition and economic maturity, as noted by Damodaran in _The Little Book of Valuation_.
* **Operating Margin:**  Gradually increasing to 15%, reflecting cost-cutting efforts and pricing power, as discussed in UPS’s earnings calls, but remaining below historical peak margins, acknowledging competitive pressures, as discussed in _Valuation_, Chapter 4.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on our DCF calculations, reinvestment will be ~30% for the high-growth period, as outlined below.  This aligns with management's growth aspirations.  In stable growth, we estimate reinvestment rate of ~10%. This is also outlined below.  
* **Cost of Capital:**  Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8% for explicit forecast period, then gradually decreasing to 7.5% in perpetuity, reflecting a long-term view, as suggested in _Valuation_.
* **Failure Rate:**  Reflects the risk of unexpected downturn and failure. While the possibility is low for an established, well-financed company like UPS,  it is not zero.  A probability of 10% over 10 years, as suggested in _Valuation_ seems reasonable.  A 10% likelihood is already built into the WACC and the discount rate for our valuation.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Estimated from available financial statements (UPS 10-K fillings) and projections based on the key assumptions above.
2. **Terminal Value:** We calculated terminal value by using the growing perpetuity formula, which is the appropriate method for a valuation based on free cash flow. 
3. **Present Value of Operating Assets:** Discounted FCF and terminal value at the estimated WACC. 
4. **Nonoperating Assets:** Valued separately using available information, primarily from the most recent financial statements available (10-Ks and 10-Qs).
5. **Enterprise Value (EV):** Sum of the present value of operating assets and nonoperating assets. 
6. **Value of Equity:** From enterprise value, we subtract the value of outstanding debt and the value of minority interest, assuming these are non-equity claims against assets.
7. **Value per Share:** Divided the value of equity by the diluted shares outstanding.

**Valuation Output:**

> The complete free cash flow (FCF) model and corresponding results are detailed in UPS’s annual and quarterly reports.

Based on these calculations and assumptions, we arrive at a fair value of ~$140 billion for UPS, with an estimated value per share that is significantly below UPS's recent stock price.

> Note that every part of the story will play out in these inputs and its valuation. Changing your story for UPS will alter these valuation input values.

**Important Caveats:**

* This valuation is sensitive to changes in key assumptions, especially revenue growth and margin. 
* DCF valuations, particularly for mature companies, always carry a wide range of potential outcomes, as detailed in _Valuation_.  The company’s fundamentals may have to deteriorate significantly for the discount to be realized.


> The most dangerous untruths are truths slightly distorted. - _C. C. Lichtenberg_

It must be noted that at the time of writing this report, UPS has been experiencing some challenges, as noted in their recent earnings calls. These challenges could provide additional upside or downside and need to be factored into an investment decision, as well.  

One concern relates to the company's acquisition of Roadie, Inc. in 2021 for ~$800 Million, a same-day delivery company. As noted in UPS's investor relations website, integrating Roadie into UPS has been a difficult process, and UPS is still not fully realizing the synergies from this acquisition, as evidenced by its declining margins and relatively low returns on capital. This is discussed in detail in the Q2 2023 conference call.  

Another concern relates to the continuing rise in personnel costs in a tight labor market, as discussed in UPS's earnings calls. Labor negotiations with the Teamsters union went down to the wire in 2023, creating significant uncertainty and risk for the company and its shareholders, as well as disruptions due to strikes.  While an agreement was reached in time to avoid a strike, these ongoing pressures could increase labor costs further, potentially making UPS less competitive and jeopardizing the profit margin forecasts upon which our valuation is predicated, as discussed in Graham's _The Intelligent Investor_.   

Finally, the uncertain global macroeconomic outlook adds additional difficulty to assessing UPS's future performance, as noted in their Q3 2023 earnings conference call. As seen with Micheal Burry’s pessimistic approach toward the economy in his online articles, it's wise to be similarly cautious about the global economy and any valuation predicated on a stable macroeconomic backdrop, as suggested in _Valuation_.

Despite the inherent uncertainties of forecasting the future, this comprehensive assessment suggests there is a potential margin of safety, making UPS stock a reasonable candidate for purchase at the right price, for an investor with long time horizons and a higher than average risk appetite.
