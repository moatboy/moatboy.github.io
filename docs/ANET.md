Pessimistic value: $47.5 B

Arista Networks is a cloud networking solutions provider focused on high-speed, software-driven cloud networking for large datacenter and campus environments. They derive revenue from selling their Extensible Operating System (EOS), network switches and routers, as well as professional services such as consulting, training, and support contracts.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenue Distribution:**  Arista primarily generates revenue from sales of products and related professional services, although it also has a small software segment. 
<ins>Their core offering is the EOS operating system</ins>, which runs on standard merchant silicon, allowing them to offer competitive pricing relative to competitors utilizing custom silicon.
* **Industry Trends:** The cloud networking industry is large and growing rapidly, driven by the secular shift toward cloud computing. However, increasing competition from larger, established players, particularly in adjacent markets such as cybersecurity, presents a challenge. The industry is also subject to rapid technological change, requiring continual innovation and adaptation to maintain a competitive edge.
* **Margins:** Arista historically enjoyed high gross and operating margins relative to its peers, thanks to its focus on high-value products and efficient operating structure. However, these margins are likely under pressure as competition intensifies and the industry matures.
* **Competitive Advantages:** Aristaâ€™s competitive advantages stem primarily from its <ins>software</ins> and <ins>customer focus</ins>.  EOS is considered best-in-class by many and it offers flexibility and powerful automation, creating high switching costs for customers. Their dedicated sales force and deep engineering expertise enable them to cater to the demanding needs of large enterprise clients.  

**Moat Analysis**

Arista's moat stems primarily from high switching costs, a strong brand name in its niche, and network effects.  While not as robust as the moats of some consumer product giants or established software companies, these advantages do provide some protection against competitors.

* **Switching Costs:** Migrating from Arista's EOS can be disruptive and costly for large enterprise customers with complex network requirements.  This creates stickiness and pricing power, which contributes to the moat.
* **Brand Name:** Arista has built a strong reputation for quality and performance in its niche.  This brand recognition is particularly valuable in a technology-driven industry where trust and reliability are paramount.
* **Network Effects:** While not a classic network effect like social media, Arista benefits from increased customer adoption of its cloud networking platform, as it gives them greater control over industry standards and makes it more difficult for competitors to gain a foothold.

However, the following factors warrant a more conservative moat rating of 3/5, rather than a higher one:

* **Competition:** The cloud networking industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with established giants like Cisco and new entrants vying for market share.
* **Technological Change:** The rapid pace of technological change in the industry necessitates continual innovation, which can be expensive and creates ongoing uncertainty.  Arista's ability to maintain its technological edge is crucial for the moat's durability.
* **Limited Pricing Power Outside Core:** While Arista enjoys pricing power with its large enterprise clients, it faces greater pressure in adjacent markets where its products may be viewed as more commoditized.


**Valuation**

A DCF model was constructed to estimate the intrinsic value of Arista Networks using a 10-year explicit forecast and a terminal value calculation. A pessimistic scenario was included as the network-centric business model continues to evolve and faces increased competition. We also used the current market price of the stock as a baseline from which to compare our valuations, as well as a second valuation derived from trading multiples to provide an additional check for any large disparities.

**Key Assumptions**

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth is assumed to decline gradually from 12% over the next five years and then eventually reach the GDP growth rate (3.5% in real terms) with the fading effect of the COVID-19 pandemic
* **Operating Margin:** Based on historical averages and comparisons to peers, we assume an operating margin of 30% to 35% in the terminal period, starting lower and ramping up to that level as the company scales (This assumes operating costs will not scale perfectly).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We derive reinvestment rate from the growth and return on new invested capital. To start conservatively, we assumed an incremental ROIC of 15%. 
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** We use a cost of equity of 9% (risk-free rate of 3.5%, equity risk premium of 5%, and unlevered beta of 0.70) and a cost of debt of 4.2% (based on Arista's bond rating). We use current capital structure of 25% debt and 75% equity.

{: .note }
All of the above assumptions are at 2024 levels and not at the latest date of financial reporting and will probably be re-estimated using the financials with the most recent annual results. 

**DCF Calculations**

1. **Explicit Forecast Period (Years 1-10):** We project free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years using the revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment assumptions. [Refer to spreadsheet for year-by-year FCF calculations]
2. **Terminal Value:** We use the growing perpetuity formula with a 3.5% stable growth rate and a 15% terminal ROIC.
   ```
   Terminal Value = (FCF in Year 11)/(WACC - g)
   Terminal Value = ($1.894 billion)/(0.0756 - 0.035) = $49.316 billion
   ```
3. **Present Value of FCF and Terminal Value:** We discount the projected FCFs and the terminal value back to today using the WACC.  [Refer to spreadsheet for year-by-year present value calculations]
4. **Enterprise Value:** The sum of the present values of the FCFs and terminal value yields the enterprise value: $60.709 billion.
5. **Equity Value:** We subtract net debt and other non-equity claims (minority interests and other liabilities) and add cash from the enterprise value to arrive at the equity value: $57.410 billion
6. **Value per Share:** Dividing the equity value by the number of shares outstanding yields the value per share: $82.12.

**Sensitivity Analysis & Scenarios**

A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of changes in key assumptions. [Refer to spreadsheet]. The most significant driver of value is the ROIC assumption, consistent with the sensitivity analysis of enterprise DCF valuations highlighted in the Valuation book.

We also performed a scenario analysis by creating bull and bear scenarios with different revenue growth and ROIC assumptions. [Refer to spreadsheet for scenario analysis].

**Relative Valuation**

[Refer to spreadsheet for multiples analysis] We compared ANET's trading multiples with its peers in the cloud networking industry. Based on multiples analysis, the median implied equity value is approximately 7.4 times the previous year's EBITDA. For ANET, the implied equity value is $44.426 billion.

**Valuation Conclusion**

{: .warning}
Based on the DCF, the equity value of Arista is estimated at $57.410 billion.  The relative valuation suggests a value of $44.426 billion. Given the increasing competition in the cloud networking market and our pessimistic assumptions, we arrive at a fair value of $47.5 billion, which is closer to the relative valuation.
{: .note}
It is important to note that the assumptions used in the valuation are based on ANET's latest 10k report and earlier quarterly financials, and it also worth reiterating that this may be too high of a valuation at $47.5 billion given ANET's low trading volume.
