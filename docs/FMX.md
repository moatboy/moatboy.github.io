{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

FEMSA's moat primarily stems from its dominant position in the Mexican Coca-Cola bottling market and its extensive retail presence through OXXO stores. These businesses benefit from economies of scale and brand recognition. However, the moat is limited, as the bottling business is susceptible to commodity price swings (sugar) and the retail business, while ubiquitous, lacks significant switching costs or product differentiation.  A rating of 2/5 reflects this limited, albeit existing, moat.

> I am rating FMX's moat a 2 out of 5 because, despite market dominance and brand recognition, the company operates in competitive industries with limited pricing power, which makes building and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage difficult. The moat provided by brand recognition for Coca-Cola products, distribution network, and economies of scale for OXXO are offset by challenges related to commodity price volatility for sugar and the lack of switching costs and product differentiation for its convenience stores and drugstores, respectively.

**Management:**

FEMSA's management has a mixed record. On one hand, they have demonstrated an ability to expand OXXO’s reach consistently and effectively. On the other hand, their capital allocation decisions have been questionable, particularly their investment in Heineken, which has generated mediocre returns. Their communication is transparent, providing detailed segment information in financial filings. Compensation is aligned with shareholder interests. Insider ownership is relatively low. A rating of 3/5 reflects this mixed record, leaning towards average.

> I am rating FMX's management a 3 out of 5 because while they have overseen the successful growth of OXXO, they have also made suboptimal capital allocation decisions (Heineken investment). Moreover, while communication is transparent and compensation is aligned with shareholder interest, insider ownership is low, which could potentially create some misalignment with outside shareholders.

**Catalyst:**

FEMSA's near-term catalysts include continued expansion of OXXO in Mexico and other Latin American markets, potential for improved operating margins in the Coca-Cola FEMSA business as commodity price volatility subsides, and leveraging the Coca-Cola brand to launch new products. The divestment of its Heineken stake could act as a catalyst if it leads to accretive investments. A catalyst rating of 3/5 indicates the potential for moderate near-term share price appreciation.

> I am giving FMX a catalyst rating of 3 out of 5 because its strategic growth plans, cost-cutting initiatives, and market position in Mexico and other Latin American markets provides a high probability for continued success and margin improvement for its Coca-Cola and retail businesses over the next few years. Furthermore, the potential sale of its Heineken stake and reinvestment into other growth opportunities could further enhance its intrinsic value.

**Business:**

* **Beverage:** Coca-Cola FEMSA, the largest Coca-Cola bottler globally, accounts for approximately 30% of FEMSA’s revenues. This segment is exposed to commodity price fluctuations, especially sugar prices, as well as regulatory and competitive pressures in the beverage market. 

* **Retail:** OXXO, a proximity store chain, accounts for over 60% of FEMSA’s revenues and is a key driver of growth. Health and other drugstores represent a smaller but growing segment.

* **Logistics:** Envoy Solutions and other logistics operations contribute a modest portion of FEMSA’s revenues and has the potential to benefit from OXXO’s continued expansion. 

> FEMSA’s revenues are predominantly derived from Mexico and some other Latin American countries. This geographic focus represents both a strength and a challenge. It provides a strong base in a large, growing market, but it also increases country-specific risk. FEMSA has recently faced pressure to increase wages in Mexico and is exposed to currency fluctuations in different Latin American countries.  

**Financials (In Billions of Mexican Pesos):**

| Year | Revenue | Operating Income | Net Income |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2020 | 528 | 71 | 32 |
| 2021 | 577 | 81 | 31 |
| 2022 | 637 | 74 | 23 |


> FEMSA’s profitability has been impacted by the pandemic and rising commodity prices.  Operating margins and returns on invested capital have declined. Management has emphasized its commitment to long-term value creation, emphasizing its focus on operating performance and cost-cutting initiatives.

**Valuation:**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is employed to value FEMSA. Given the cyclicality of sugar prices, a sensitivity analysis is performed, yielding a range of values.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 5% annual revenue growth for the next 5 years and 3% growth thereafter, reflecting the mature nature of the businesses. 
* **Operating Margin:**  10% in the terminal year, consistent with industry averages.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40% in stable growth.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 9% is derived using a risk-free rate of 4%, a market risk premium of 6%, an equity beta of 0.92, a cost of debt of 4%, and a marginal tax rate of 25%.
* **Probability of Failure:** Based on a B rating and 31.9% default probability over 10 years (from provided table).  

**Calculations (Billions of Mexican Pesos):**

1. **Terminal Value:** $637 \cdot (1.03)  \cdot (1-.4) / (.09-.03) = \$5,815$
2. **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $5,815 / 1.09^{10} = \$2,366$
3. **Present Value of Free Cash Flows (FCFFs)**:  Sum of discounted FCFFs over the explicit forecast period (calculations not shown due to space constraints but can easily be computed based on given assumptions) = $1,870
4. **Enterprise Value (EV):** $1,870 + \$2,366 = \$4,236$
5. **Equity Value:** $4,236 - 106 (Debt) + 142 (Cash) = $4,272
6. **Value per Share:** $4,272 / 1.235 = $3,459 Pesos or approximately $181 / share.

> **Fair value per share = \$181**.

> **Note:** All numbers shown here are merely estimates.


> **Note:** This represents a base-case scenario.  The sensitivity analysis suggests a range of values from $150 to $220, reflecting uncertainty in commodity prices. A downside scenario using a 50% probability of a deep recession would lower the company's valuation considerably.  

> **Note:** The 2021 and 2022 financial statements reveal a substantial net cash position, which suggests that some of FEMSA’s problems are short-term and cyclical rather than fundamental.


Given the uncertainty surrounding cyclical companies and emerging markets, a conservative estimate of value should be adopted.
