## Moat Rating: 2.5 / 5

{: .warning }
While FEMSA has some moats, they are narrow. It doesn't have a strong moat as the competitive landscape is very intense.
*   **Brand Strength:** While Coca-Cola is a powerful brand, FEMSA is its bottler and doesn't own the brand itself. A strong brand, which has loyal customers, provides them with pricing power, enabling the firm to generate a premium price with strong and repeat sales and profits.
*    **Distribution Network:** FEMSA has an extensive distribution network that allows them to reach a wide range of clients.
     *  This moat is relatively solid and provides a certain level of protection, it doesn't stop entrants from getting into the market.
*  **Scale:** The company has scale in its main operations which, by itself doesn't provide any solid competitive advantage. 
    *    Large scale allows FEMSA to produce efficiently, which will allow them to have a relative advantage when it comes to pricing, but it's replicable.

## Risks to the Moat
*    **Rising inflation and currency fluctuations:** These factors, if not managed well, could negatively impact margins and revenues.
*   **Competition:** The beverage market, as well as convenience retail, is very competitive and changes are very frequent, so new products from competition can capture market share from them.
*    **New Entrants:** Although the company has good penetration, it still has the risk of new entrants who can develop a better, more efficient value chain.
*   **Economic Downturns:** Global and local economic downturns can affect consumer spending, therefore affecting sales.
*  **Regulatory changes:** Changes in tax law or other regulations can alter the company’s operations, margins, and revenue.

## Business Resilience
*   The company has shown resilience during turbulent periods, especially during the COVID pandemic and is showing positive trends.
*   It has a good mix of brands as well as channels (convenience store chain, etc), which have different characteristics and therefore provide resilience to some downturns.
*  They have also shown ability to innovate to keep up with changing consumer preferences.

## Understandability: 3 / 5

While FEMSA's operations are relatively clear, analyzing its complex financial structure with various operations and its exposure to different geographies adds some complexity and requires more in-depth understanding. It's a well-established business, but it's operations are still quite complex, making it above the easy-to-understand segment.

## Balance Sheet Health: 3.5 / 5

*   The company has been making good progress in deleveraging and remains below their financial goal of a 2X Debt to EBITDA Ratio.
*  They have decent liquidity.
*   They also have some currency risk and a big debt pile, which brings some concerns.
* While all of these things are happening, the company is still a cash-generating machine.

## Conclusion
FEMSA is an interesting business, with leading brands in the Latin American region, an expansive distribution network, and a high-margin business that is relatively resilient. However, the highly competitive environment and increasing prices still do pose some risk to its moat. The company has great potential for growth, and has shown good financial performance, but some concerns still remain.
