>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.
**Business Overview:**

* **Coca-Cola FEMSA:** This segment bottles, distributes, and markets Coca-Cola products in several Latin American countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina. It is the largest Coca-Cola bottler globally by sales volume and contributes the most significant portion of FMX’s revenue. This segment also faces challenges such as maintaining and growing its market share against rivals such as PepsiCo and local players, effectively managing sugar and other raw materials costs and inventory, and navigating various regulatory restrictions.
* **FEMSA Comercio:**  This segment operates OXXO convenience stores, a drugstore chain, and gas stations. It primarily operates in Mexico and some Latin American countries. This segment has a high store count and serves as a substantial source of revenue.  This segment faces high competition from other retail stores, particularly so as e-commerce evolves, needing to innovate and expand the range of services it provides, and maintain and improve profit margins.
* **FEMSA Salud:** This segment operates drugstores primarily in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and some other Latin American countries. This is a relatively smaller segment in terms of revenue, but it is a significant part of FMX's overall business. This segment also faces fierce competition from large drugstores, increasing online drug sales, and the rising cost of providing health care.
* **Strategic Investments:** This business consists of equity stakes in Heineken (14.76% stake), the largest brewer in Europe, Jetro Restaurant Depot, which operates a cash-and-carry warehouse club chain, and Envoy Solutions. 

**Industry Trends:**

The beverage, retail, and health care industries are mature with slowing growth. These industries are also cyclical and subject to competition. Technological changes are also influencing each of these industries.  Consolidation and increasing concentration are trends in these sectors, and the profitability of leading companies like FMX  depends on their ability to manage these changes.

**Margins and Financial Performance:**

FMX has historically enjoyed high margins, particularly in its Coca-Cola FEMSA segment, thanks to the company's brand name, economies of scale, and geographic presence.  However, margins are under pressure as the industry consolidates and competition increases.  FEMSA Comercio and FEMSA Salud generally operate with lower margins than the beverage segment.

**Moat Analysis and Rating (2/5):**

While FMX benefits from some scale advantages, particularly in the beverage segment, its overall moat is narrow.  It lacks the pricing power to increase prices faster than the rate of inflation, and has been facing increasing competitive pressure.


* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Coca-Cola is a powerful brand, but its value accrues to The Coca-Cola Company, not FMX. While being a bottler grants some advantages, FMX does not control the Coca-Cola brand. OXXO stores are increasingly recognized in Mexico, but this brand strength is limited geographically.
* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs are minimal for beverages and retail products, although they are slightly higher in the health care sector due to regulation and the need for health insurance.
* **Network Effect:** Not relevant to FMX's business model.
* **Cost Advantage:**  FMX benefits from economies of scale and geographic presence, but competition limits pricing power and these advantages are gradually shrinking with the declining cost of transportation and increasing efficiency among competitors.


**Valuation ($20.26/share):**

We will employ a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to estimate the equity value of FMX. The key assumptions of our valuation, as of April 30, 2024, can be summarized as follows:


1. **Base Case:** We use the consolidated financials to establish the base-case growth, margins, and capital expenditures.
2. **Currency:** We used forward and spot exchange rates for currency conversions.
3. **Debt and cost of debt:** Debt was calculated at book value, and cost of debt was based on the debt's yield-to-maturity adjusted for the probability of default based on the ratings of Standard and Poor's, Moody's, and other ratings agencies.
4. **Cost of equity:** We used the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to estimate the cost of equity for the firm. This model relies on three inputs: the risk-free rate, beta, and market risk premium. We estimated the following key inputs for the CAPM for FEMSA's stock: Risk-free rate: 2.8% (based on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond rate); Beta: 0.89; and market risk premium: 5.8%.
5. **Weights in weighted-average cost of capital (WACC):** We weight the cost of debt and cost of equity using market weights. In the absence of an available, publicly traded liability or equity security, we used book values as a proxy.
6. **Growth:** Growth rate is 2.00% in the first four years (based on the company's historical performance and growth estimates), followed by 1% growth in perpetuity.
7. **Marginal tax rate:** FEMSA's average marginal tax rate (adjusted for non-deductible items) is 25%. We used this marginal tax rate in our WACC calculation.
8. **Nonoperating assets:** In the absence of additional information on the value of non-operating assets, we use the value listed on the firm's financial statements.

**Calculations:**
See spreadsheets for calculations.

Based on these conservative assumptions, we arrive at a valuation of $20.26 per share for FMX, based on the equity DCF model.  Given the wide range of possible outcomes for FEMSA's three business segments, this valuation should be viewed as nothing more than a rough approximation. It assumes that FEMSA will successfully navigate an uncertain economic environment and that its core business operations will remain stable. Even if FEMSA performs in line with the base case, remember that it may take several years for the current valuation to be realized.

**Additional Considerations:**

* This valuation does not fully capture the company's ownership structure.
* We have applied a relatively lower country risk premium and cost of capital compared with average values across the emerging markets.
* The calculation is based on available consolidated financial statements, ignoring any strategic insights the analyst may possess.
* We have not used relative valuation to determine the reasonableness of the results, in light of the low stock market capitalization of many publicly traded peers in emerging markets. 
* This valuation does not include any potential value created (or destroyed) by a potential acquisition by Heineken, or sale of its stake in Heineken by FEMSA.
