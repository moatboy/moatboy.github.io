>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Fastenal's moat stems primarily from **high switching costs** and **economies of scale**, particularly at the local level.  As highlighted by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, switching costs create a significant advantage. For businesses, changing suppliers of fasteners, which are essential but represent a small fraction of total costs, is a hassle they'd rather avoid. This "stickiness" gives Fastenal pricing power.  Furthermore, their vast network of stores and distribution centers, far exceeding those of competitors, enables them to offer faster delivery and on-site services. This creates a scale advantage, allowing them to outcompete smaller, local players.  Fastenal's large size also makes it difficult for new players to enter this specific market. However, this moat is not impregnable. The increasing consolidation of the industrial distribution industry means Fastenal is facing tougher competition from larger rivals, like W.W. Grainger, which also have scale and resources.  Technological innovations in inventory management, while not likely to disrupt existing relationships soon, could eventually reduce switching costs.

**Management (4/5):**

Fastenal's management team displays a long-term focus and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. Their history of consistent dividend increases and share repurchases underscores this commitment, as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*. Executive compensation is reasonable and largely tied to company performance.  Management communicates clearly and thoroughly in earnings calls and financial filings. For instance, in the Q4 2022 earnings call, management gave valuable insights on current margin and growth expectations, which are helpful in assessing the company's prospects. While insider ownership is low, executive tenure is high, which suggests a solid corporate culture. However, management's recent pursuit of growth through acquisitions and new product launches is slightly concerning. Acquisitions, while potentially value-creating, can often be value-destroying if synergies are not fully realized. A more conservative and cautious approach to acquisitions might be warranted.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

There are no obvious, imminent catalysts on the horizon for Fastenal.  The ongoing recovery in industrial production, however, could provide a mild tailwind.  Management’s continued focus on cost controls and operational efficiencies could lead to margin expansion and improve returns on invested capital. This incremental improvement in the business, though not a large catalyst, could potentially attract investors. Further consolidation of smaller players in the industrial distribution industry could make Fastenal an acquisition target for a larger player.  These potential outcomes, however, are already partially baked into the current stock price and are not likely to dramatically increase shareholder value.

**Business:**

Fastenal operates through a massive network of around 2,000 stores in the United States. It distributes a wide variety of maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) products to manufacturers and contractors. Its business is somewhat cyclical, as it is tied to industrial activity.  Fasteners are a key product category, but the company also distributes a wide range of other products, including safety and metalworking products.  Their competitive advantage is primarily local.  Fastenal's strategy focuses on increasing penetration of existing customers by adding new product categories and offering more convenient purchasing solutions.

One important trend in the industry, as mentioned by management in recent earnings calls, is the trend toward vendor-managed inventory (VMI). This trend benefits Fastenal because it tightens relationships with customers and increases switching costs.

**Financials:**

Fastenal has generated impressive returns on invested capital (ROIC), averaging over 20 percent for over a decade. Net profit margins are thin (around 10%) compared to other more specialized industrial companies, but Fastenal’s business model generates significant amounts of free cash flow. This resilient business model is in fact reflected in their substantial share repurchases. Financial leverage is very low.
{: .important }

However, revenue growth has slowed in recent years, and the ongoing consolidation of smaller distributors has significantly increased competition from larger rivals. Revenue growth rates and ROIC, although above average, have been declining over the last 3-5 years.


**Valuation ($38.2 Billion):**
We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Fastenal.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We project revenue growth of 2 percent per year for the next five years, declining to the long-run GDP growth rate of 1.5 percent thereafter. The industrial production growth outlook is weak. These growth rates are significantly below management’s stated goals of 30 percent annual revenue growth.
* **Margins:** We assume that operating margins will remain stable at 20 percent. Margins are sensitive to industry pricing trends.
* **Reinvestment:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 40%.  This is higher than historical levels due to their increased focus on acquisitions and new product launches.

* **Cost of Capital:** We will use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.5 percent. This is based on a risk-free rate of 3.5% (10-year U.S. Treasury bond), an equity risk premium of 4.0%, a beta of 1.05 (estimated from regression analysis using monthly returns over the past five years against returns for the MSCI World Index), a marginal tax rate of 25%, a debt-to-capital ratio of 20%, and a cost of debt of 5% (the approximate yield on Fastenal's bonds at the time of the valuation). The cost of equity is estimated to be 7.75%, computed using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).


**Calculations:**

* **NOPLAT:** $1.81 Billion (2022) growing at 2% annually over the next five years before tapering off to 1.5%.
* **Free Cash Flow:**  Calculated as after tax operating income *(1- reinvestment rate)*
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the growth in perpetuity approach and incorporating the assumed perpetuity growth rate and terminal reinvestment rate.  Calculated as: *(NOPLAT * (1+ Growth rate))/ (Cost of Capital - Growth rate)*
* **Present Value:** Discounted by WACC.
* **Total Enterprise Value:**  Sum of present values of free cash flow and terminal value. 
* **Equity Value:** Enterprise value minus debt and plus cash.
* **Value per Share:** Equity value divided by number of shares outstanding.


**Fair Value Approximation:** $38.2 Billion, or approximately $48.00 per share.  This valuation is significantly below Fastenal's recent market cap of around $43 Billion.  Given the weak economic growth outlook, intense competition, low insider ownership, and the somewhat speculative nature of their acquisition and new product launches strategy, a degree of caution is warranted.
{: .warning }

It is worth reiterating that this valuation is based on conservative assumptions. There is a wide range of possible outcomes, and the current stock price suggests investors have built in considerable optimism.


**Recent Concerns:**

Fastenal’s financials have been strong historically, but recent results have revealed some soft spots. As of Q2 2023, revenue growth had slowed significantly. Management attributed this slowdown to macro headwinds and the tough year-over-year comps in the face of unanticipated strength in 2022 results. 


**Additional Considerations:**

One factor not explicitly considered in the DCF valuation is the option value embedded in Fastenal’s business model.  As a dominant distributor, Fastenal has the option to expand into adjacent markets or develop new products. However, these opportunities are challenging to value with any precision.
{: .note }

The book *Valuation* by Aswath Damodaran highlights the significance of incorporating optionality, but also notes its complexity and subjectivity.

Overall, Fastenal is a high-quality company with a strong track record and a well-defined moat.  However, the current valuation implies considerable growth, and the market has already begun to reflect a slowdown in performance.
