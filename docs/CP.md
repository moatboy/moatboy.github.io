>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

CP benefits from a narrow moat, primarily stemming from **economies of scale and the network effect.**  The railway industry is capital intensive with high barriers to entry, requiring significant upfront investments in infrastructure (tracks, terminals, rolling stock) and regulatory approvals.  This creates a structural advantage for existing players like CP. As Dorsey points out in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, companies that control distribution networks often gain moats based on the advantages they have over new entrants.

*However*, while physical infrastructure can limit some competition, it does not create an insurmountable barrier.  Competition from trucking, while not a perfect substitute, does exist and limits pricing power. Moreover, as discussed in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, the network effect is far more relevant to tech and digital platforms. Hence the 3/5 moat rating.

**Management (3/5):**

CP’s management receives a moderate rating due to a mixed record on several factors:

* **History/Experience:** The current CEO, Keith Creel, has been with CP for over 20 years, providing considerable railroad experience. However, the company’s overall performance during his tenure as CEO has been solid but not outstanding, with returns on invested capital fluctuating. This suggests competence but not exceptional capital allocation skill, as emphasized by Buffett in *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is significant but appears largely tied to operating and financial performance indicators and share price, according to the company's annual reports. This is good alignment to shareholder incentives. While stock awards and options do exist, they do not appear excessive relative to industry peers.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership, including that of the CEO, is relatively low, based on company filings, though not enough to be a red flag, and similar to others in the industry.
* **Communication:** CP’s investor relations materials provide reasonable breakdowns by commodity type and geography, along with annual metrics and commentary on key value drivers. However, the level of detail and transparency, particularly concerning individual business units' financials and costs, could be better. Greater transparency, as emphasized by Damodaran in the investor communication section of *Valuation*, would benefit sophisticated long-term investors.
* **Capital Allocation:** CP has shown both good and bad examples of capital allocation. In 2021, it acquired Kansas City Southern (KCS), which seems to have been a sound decision strategically, creating a North American rail network.  However, while CP has engaged in share repurchases, they don’t seem to have consistently bought back shares at attractive prices. This raises concerns about capital allocation savvy.

{: .important }

Overall, CP's management demonstrates a reasonable level of competency, but there is room for improvement in capital allocation and communication transparency, thus justifying the 3/5 rating.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Near-shoring and supply chain reorganization:**  CP’s transcontinental network could benefit from companies seeking to reduce their reliance on Asian suppliers and shorten their supply chains.  However, the extent of this benefit remains to be seen and competition from trucking will continue to be a factor. Hence the moderate 2/5 rating.

**Business:**

* **Revenues:**  CP generates revenue from six major segments: Grain, Coal, Potash, Forest Products, Energy, Chemicals and Plastics, Metals, Minerals, and Consumer Products, Automotive, and Intermodal.  Grain is the company’s largest revenue segment, contributing around 28% of total revenues (Q3 2023 earnings call). The geographic mix of CP is concentrated in Canada and the U.S.  
* **Industry Trends:** The railroad industry is consolidating, with a handful of major players dominating the North American market.  This consolidation is likely to continue, driven by economies of scale and cost advantages.  CP’s acquisition of KCS fits into this trend, creating the only single-line railway connecting Canada, the U.S., and Mexico (Q3 2021 earnings call).
* **Margins:**  Operating margins in the railroad industry tend to be reasonably stable and above average, although fuel costs can cause some volatility. CP's operating ratio (a key efficiency metric for railroads) has historically been good relative to peers.  

{: .warning }

*Recent concerns:* In the Q4 2023 earnings call, management noted that Canadian grain volumes have been impacted by lower crop production. CP is also facing an increase in operating expenses due to inflation. The labor force is unionized (cp-20211231.htm), and the company faces wage pressures.

**Financials (In-Depth):**

CP’s financials have been analyzed using data from its 2019-2023 annual reports. The key financial metrics are:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue growth has been lumpy due to acquisitions, most notably KCS, and the cyclicality of certain commodity types. The KCS acquisition closed in 2023 (cp-20230331.htm). 
* **Profitability:**  CP has consistently generated returns on invested capital above its cost of capital, though the level has fluctuated. A key focus has been improving the operating ratio to reduce costs. However, inflationary pressure and wage pressures are threatening to narrow profit margins. 
* **Capital Structure:** CP is moderately leveraged, which is typical for a railroad.  The company has increased its debt significantly to fund the KCS acquisition, but still maintains an investment-grade credit rating.
* **Cash Flows:** Free cash flow is robust but can vary considerably from year to year due to the lumpiness of capital expenditures inherent in railroad operations.

**Valuation ($70 Billion):**

{: .new }

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used to value CP, focusing on free cash flow to the firm.  A 10-year explicit forecast period was used, followed by a continuing value.  Key assumptions, based on a pessimistic and skeptical view, are as follows:

* **Revenue Growth:** A gradually declining revenue growth rate is assumed, starting at 2% and declining to 1% in perpetuity, reflecting the cyclical nature of some business lines and the maturity of the industry.
* **Margins:**  Margins are assumed to remain relatively stable in real terms, but nominal growth is incorporated to reflect inflation using CP's disclosure of inflation rate in Canada.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** A reinvestment rate equal to the previous year’s reinvestment rate is assumed for the first five years in order to avoid naive base year extrapolation. For the terminal value, the reinvestment rate was computed using a more conservative long-term return on incremental invested capital. The result is lower than the rate shown in the company's capital budget projection table.
* **Cost of Capital:** A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.0% is used, based on a conservative estimate of the cost of equity (using capital asset pricing model) and the cost of debt (based on the company's bond rating). The company’s tax rate is assumed to be 25%.
* **Probability of Failure:**  A probability of failure of 5% is used for the valuation, reflecting challenges such as rising input costs and economic uncertainty.

*The resulting DCF valuation is approximately $70 billion.*  This represents an approximately 15-20% discount to the company's trading price at the time of this analysis.

{: .note }

It is important to note that this valuation is based on a number of assumptions, and the actual value of CP could be higher or lower depending on the accuracy of those assumptions and how they evolve over time.  The margin of safety embedded in the valuation should provide some downside protection, but there is no guarantee of future returns.


It's worth noting that management has repeatedly expressed confidence in the company’s long-term prospects, citing strong demand for freight transportation, the benefits of the KCS acquisition, and its own operational efficiency initiatives (Q3 2023 earnings call). These positive comments contrast somewhat with the more conservative assumptions used in the valuation model.



If there's anything that looks unusual or risky on CP's financial statements, mention it with a callout block.
