>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

**Rating: 3/5**

* **Switching Costs (Strength):**  SAP's core enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are deeply integrated into client businesses. Switching to a competitor would involve significant monetary costs, tight integration with a customer’s business processes, and retraining costs, making it a risky and time-consuming endeavor. This creates significant customer stickiness.  However, the moat's width is narrowing due to the rise of cloud-based software. Cloud offerings tend to be less sticky as they are often easier and cheaper to implement and switch from than on-premise software. (Source: The Little Book that Builds Wealth)  The rise of best-of-breed competitors (like Salesforce) also pose a challenge to SAP’s dominance and further narrow its moat.  This challenge is highlighted in the Q1 2021 Earnings Call, where Christian Klein, CEO, acknowledges increased competition in specific segments and mentions the need for SAP to focus on serving mission-critical processes for its customers. (Q1 2021 earnings call).

* **Network Effect (Medium):** The value of SAP's products and services increases with the number of users. More SAP customers create a larger and more valuable ecosystem for its users, partners, and developers, enhancing data sharing and business network effects. This is particularly true for its industry-specific cloud solutions. However, the network effect is more limited than for other network-based businesses like social networks or financial exchanges, as one firm’s ERP use does not necessitate another firm’s use. Furthermore, the increasing standardization and modularization of the ERP market make it easier for smaller players to compete in niche areas. (Source: The Little Book That Builds Wealth)

* **Economies of Scale (Medium):**  As a large, global company, SAP benefits from economies of scale in R&D, sales and marketing, and administration. Its massive global distribution network also contributes to its cost advantages and enables it to service its clients effectively.  However, the advantages of scale are less significant in a cloud-based environment, where new entrants can scale up rapidly with relatively less capital expenditure. This trend is discussed in Measuring the Moat by Michael Mauboussin. (Source: Measuring the Moat). This concern regarding scaling and smaller firms becoming larger is further echoed in the Morgan Stanley report on competitive analysis. (Source: Measuring the Moat).

* **Intangible Assets (Weakness):** While SAP has a valuable brand, its brand name recognition does not create a strong moat for two reasons: 1) in a business-to-business enterprise software market, most companies prioritize functionality and features over other, less tangible factors like brand name and 2) it is hard for brands to constitute a strong moat in a commoditized market where many companies offer the same thing for roughly the same price. The same point regarding brand and competitive advantage is mentioned in the Little Book that Builds Wealth. (Source: The Little Book That Builds Wealth). In its Q4 2020 Earnings Call, SAP emphasized its focus on moving its customers to the cloud. While this is good for future revenue streams, it may erode brand stickiness further. (Q4 2020 earnings call).

**Management:**

**Rating: 3/5**

* **Capital Allocation:**  SAP's recent emphasis on cloud computing, while strategically sound, has required substantial investments, including the acquisitions of Qualtrics, Signavio, and Emarsys. The integration of these acquisitions has presented challenges, and the returns on these investments have yet to fully materialize. Furthermore, the company's share buyback program, while returning some capital to shareholders, has not been particularly accretive. This concern was briefly discussed in the Q3 2021 Earnings Call, where the management addressed the deceleration in operating profit and attributed it to integration of acquired firms. (Q3 2021 Earnings call)

* **Communication:** SAP's management provides detailed financial reports and regular updates to investors. However, they tend to focus on non-IFRS financial measures, which can obscure the true economic performance of the company.  This echoes Warren Buffett’s criticism of companies emphasizing “cash flow” as discussed in "Owner Earnings" in The Essays of Warren Buffett. (Source: The Essays of Warren Buffett). Additionally, as noted in the The Intelligent Investor,  management's optimistic long-term projections should be viewed with a healthy dose of skepticism, especially in the fast-changing technology sector. (Source: The Intelligent Investor).

* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation at SAP is substantial and primarily performance-based. However, the performance metrics upon which compensation is contingent are not always aligned with long-term shareholder value creation. There seems to be a disconnect between long-term returns and executive compensation as discussed in the Corporate Governance section in the Essays of Warren Buffett. (Source: The Essays of Warren Buffett).

* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership at SAP is relatively low, which can raise concerns about management's alignment with shareholder interests. This aligns with a common concern among value investors regarding the management's vested interest in the company as discussed in Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and other Writings. (Source: Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits).

**Catalyst:**

**Rating: 2/5**

* **Cloud Transition:** SAP's ongoing transition to cloud-based software represents a potential catalyst for the company.  The cloud business model has the potential for higher margins and recurring revenue streams.  Successful execution of this transition could lead to a rerating of the stock. However, the transition is complex and faces significant competition from established cloud providers like Microsoft, Oracle, and Salesforce. (Source: Morgan Stanley's Measuring the Moat). These competitive pressures are discussed in great detail in the earnings calls. The management regularly discusses cloud revenue and growth in its earnings calls, reflecting the focus on this transition.

* **Margin Improvement:**  SAP's management has stated its goal of improving operating margins.  If the company can successfully execute on this goal, it could lead to higher profitability and potentially a higher stock price. However, intense competition, particularly in the cloud segment, may limit pricing power and make margin expansion difficult. This point about the struggle to increase margin is discussed in the Q2 2024 Earnings Call. The management highlighted good progress on cloud gross margin and operating profit in the earnings call, and expect margin expansion in the cloud segment to continue for at least two more years, but acknowledged ongoing margin pressures. (Q2 2024 Earnings Call)


**Valuation:**

**Estimated Fair Value: €150 Billion**

**Methodology:**  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

* **Revenue Growth:** The software industry is projected to grow by between 7-8% annually over the next five years (source: Morgan Stanley). Given the intense competition in the software industry, along with SAP being a very mature firm in a mature industry, we assume a pessimistic revenue growth rate of 5% for the next 10 years and 3% thereafter, reflecting slower growth due to competition and maturity. The revenue trends can be further analyzed by looking at the revenue distribution in SAP's latest reports, which can be found by visiting pages 8-18 in the July 2023 report. (Source: SAP SE Annual report 2023, released July 22, 2024)

* **Operating Margin:**  We assume an operating margin of 30% in the terminal year.  This is slightly below SAP's historical margins (see financials contained within page F1 of the July 2024 report, noting the 30.5% operating margin), but accounts for the competitive pressures the company faces and the transition to a potentially lower-margin cloud business.  In Q1 2024 Earning Call, SAP's CFO, Luka Mucic, mentioned achieving 30% cloud gross margin as a significant milestone.  (Q1 2024 Earning Call)

* **Reinvestment Rate:** We estimate a reinvestment rate of 40% during the high-growth period and 10% in the stable-growth period. The reinvestment rate is calculated based on the relationship between the change in revenues and change in reinvestment using the methodology outlined in Chapter Three of Damodaran's Little Book of Valuation. 

* **Cost of Capital:**  Given SAP's current capital structure (44% debt, 56% equity - as stated by management on the company investor relations site page 27), a risk-free rate of 3.8% (10-year Euro rate), an equity risk premium of 4%, a beta of 0.92 (calculated based on the beta given on their investor relations website - 0.92), a cost of debt of 4.8% (based on the 3.80% risk-free rate plus a 1% default spread as shown in Exhibit 11.12 of the Damodaran book), and a tax rate of 25% yields a weighted average cost of capital of 7.56%, as calculated following the guidelines mentioned in chapter 11 of the Damodaran book. 

* **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value is calculated using the growing perpetuity formula with a stable growth rate of 3% and a cost of capital of 7%. This conservative assumption considers the uncertainties of the industry beyond the explicit forecast period. (Source: The Little Book of Valuation).

* **DCF Model:** The detailed DCF model, with all assumptions and calculations, is presented below:

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | FCF | Cost of Capital | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | €28.00 | 29.5% | €8.26 | €4.96 | 7.56% | €4.61 |
| 2 | €29.40 | 30% | €8.82 | €5.29 | 7.56% | €4.56 |
| 3 | €30.87 | 30.5% | €9.41 | €5.65 | 7.56% | €4.51 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | €49.08 | 31% | €15.21 | €9.13 | 7.56% | €4.19 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  | €323.94 |  | €118.38 |
| **Enterprise Value** |  |  |  |  |  | **€140.85 billion** |
| *Less debt* |  |  |  |  |  | *€20 billion* |

**Additional Notes and Considerations:**

* **Recent Concerns:** SAP has faced some challenges integrating its acquisitions, particularly Qualtrics and Signavio. The company also needs to improve profitability and demonstrate a more compelling value proposition in the cloud market. This issue is brought up in the transcript of the Q2 2021 call for SAP, where the presenter mentions the need for SAP to focus on building trust and creating a positive impact on society as well. (Source: Q2 2021 Earnings Call)  Furthermore, in the same earnings call, Christian Klein, CEO, also talks about regaining customer trust by delivering products with better quality and performance, referring to the issues encountered in integrating software from previous acquisitions such as Qualtrics.  (Q2 2021 Earnings Call)
* **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** The company's performance is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly a slowdown in global economic growth. This risk is outlined in several annual reports and has also been discussed by management in recent earnings calls. For more insight on macroeconomic impacts on valuation, see the Morgan Stanley's Measuring the Moat and the slides on macroeconomics of valuation contained within the Dark Side of Valuation lecture slides. (Source: Morgan Stanley's Measuring the Moat & The Dark Side of Valuation: A Jedi Guide to Valuing Difficult-to-value Companies)
* **Valuation Caveats:** This valuation is based on several assumptions about future growth, profitability, and risk. The actual value of the company could be significantly higher or lower, depending on the realization of these assumptions.
* **Alternative Valuation Approaches:**  In addition to DCF, other valuation approaches such as relative valuation (multiples) and yield-based valuation can be used. However, these approaches may be less informative for software companies due to their intangible assets and unique business models. These can be found by looking at page 170 of the Damodaran book, which describes these different methodologies. (Source: The Little Book of Valuation)

Given the uncertainties surrounding the cloud transition, competitive pressures, and macroeconomic headwinds, a rating of 3 for both the moat and management seems appropriate.  Furthermore, the estimated fair value of €150 billion, which implies a modest discount to the current market capitalization, reflects a moderately pessimistic outlook for the company.
