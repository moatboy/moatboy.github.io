The Trade Desk operates a demand-side platform (DSP) in the ad tech industry.  A DSP enables ad buyers to programmatically purchase ad space across various channels, including display, mobile, video, audio, connected TV (CTV), and digital out-of-home (DOOH). TTD competes with other DSPs such as Google's DV360, Amazon's DSP, and Xandr Invest.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

TTD has a narrow moat derived from the following sources:

* **Switching Costs:**  Large advertising clients using TTD's platform and its data and analytical tools, such as Koa, develop significant operational dependencies.  Switching to a new DSP requires retraining, data migration, and integration of new tools. This creates friction and discourages switching, as articulated in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.
* **Network Effects:**  As more advertisers use TTD's platform, more data is collected, improving the platform's algorithms and making it more attractive to both advertisers and publishers. This network effect creates a virtuous cycle that strengthens the platform's competitive position. 
* **Intangible Assets (Koa):** Koa, TTD's AI engine, is a valuable intangible asset that allows for advanced targeting and bidding. While replicable in theory (any company can invest in AI), Koa’s current efficacy provides a temporary competitive edge that allows TTD to extract premium prices. The moat based on Koa is not long-lasting since the ad-tech industry has low barriers to entry and is continuously evolving.

The moat rating is limited to 3/5 due to the dynamic nature of the ad tech industry. Technological advancements and changing regulatory environments can quickly erode any advantages, as noted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* and the Morgan Stanley report.


**Management (3/5):**

* **Experience and History:**  Jeff Green, the founder and CEO, has substantial experience in the ad tech industry and has successfully guided TTD since its inception.  However, like many growth companies, TTD has not faced a serious test of its resilience during an extended downturn. This raises questions about management's ability to navigate through challenging macroeconomic environments, as raised by Benjamin Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*.
* **Communication:**  Management’s Q3 2023 earnings call showed a frank and open discussion about the potential and risks associated with OpenPath and the challenges with CTV measurement.  However, there have also been instances of overly optimistic projections in the past, as cautioned against by Aswath Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*.  
* **Capital Allocation:**  TTD's acquisition of Adbrain, which has now been shut down, raises concerns about capital allocation decisions, echoing Buffett's criticism of overpriced acquisitions.  Additionally, the focus on acquisitions rather than internal reinvestments indicates less conviction in the core business.  The company's capital structure includes multiple share classes with varying voting rights. Class B shares, which trade publicly, have negligible voting rights.
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Jeff Green’s compensation, which is largely equity-based, partially aligns his incentives with shareholders.  However, his control over voting rights and the use of stock-based compensation could dilute current investors.

The management rating is capped at 3/5 due to the high use of stock-based compensation, the lack of substantial reinvestment in the core business and the lack of transparency about multiple share classes.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **CTV Growth:** CTV continues to be a significant growth driver for TTD.  As noted in Q3 2023 earnings call, the company is actively expanding CTV inventory and improving measurement capabilities.  However, challenges remain, such as the fragmentation of CTV viewership and the lack of standardized measurement across platforms.
* **OpenPath:**  OpenPath directly connects publishers and advertisers, potentially disintermediating ad agencies.  As mentioned in the Q3 2023 earnings call, TTD sees this as a significant catalyst, but there is uncertainty regarding its adoption by publishers and its impact on the traditional agency model.
* **International Expansion:**  TTD continues to expand internationally, especially in fast-growing emerging markets.  However, country-specific risks, as highlighted in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, and increased competition limit the potential for substantial value creation.

The catalyst rating is moderate at 2/5 due to uncertainties related to CTV and OpenPath, and competitive and macroeconomic pressures.

**Valuation ($50 Billion):**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model using enterprise discounted cash flow (enterprise DCF) with free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).

**Assumptions:**

{: .warning }
* **Revenue Growth:**  Based on TTD's Q3 2023 press release and industry trends, we assume revenue growth to slow down significantly to around 12% over the next two years and then gradually decline to 3% (the estimated long-run growth rate for the U.S. economy) over the subsequent eight years.  *This assumes a significant slowdown in the ad tech industry given tougher comparables and the economic climate.*
{: .note }
* **Operating Margin:** We assume operating margins will increase gradually to 35% over the next 10 years to be in line with peer companies with strong moats.  *TTD is currently operating at lower margins due to investments in emerging technologies and increasing headcount.*
{: .note }
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume that TTD will decrease its reinvestment rate to 20% in the stable growth period, reflecting maturity of the business. *This assumes TTD's investments will become more productive as it scales.*
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 
    * **Risk-free Rate:** 4% (based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate)
    * **Equity Risk Premium:** 5% (based on historical data)
    * **Beta:** 1.2 (based on publicly traded competitors)
    * **Cost of Equity:** 10%
    * **Cost of Debt:** 6% (based on current yields on TTD debt)
    * **Tax Rate:** 25%
    * **Debt/Equity Ratio:** 15/85 (Target capital structure)
    * **WACC:** 9%

**Calculations:**

{: .note }
We project FCFF, invested capital and ROIC, as well as operating expenses and taxes, over the next ten years using the assumptions outlined above.  *We use a sensitivity analysis and probability-weighted average for the terminal value calculation with the DCF. Additional details available in the linked files, including spreadsheets, detailed calculations, and tables. See Appendix D for more detail on leveraging and unlevering beta.*

**Caveats:**

* **Cyclical Industry:** The ad tech industry is cyclical and sensitive to economic downturns.  A severe recession could impact TTD's revenues and profits more than anticipated. *This is a key risk to valuation and is reflected in our pessimistic growth assumptions.*
* **Competition:** Competition is intense in the ad tech industry. Google and Amazon are formidable competitors with substantial resources and rapidly changing industry landscape. *A slowdown in the CTV market or lack of adoption of OpenPath could intensify competition and threaten TTD's market share and margins.*
* **Measurement:**  The lack of standardized measurement in CTV makes it difficult to compare performance and quantify the effectiveness of ad campaigns. *This creates uncertainty about the long-term growth potential of the CTV market and TTD's ability to capture market share.*
* **Regulation:** The increasing regulatory scrutiny regarding user privacy and data collection (such as the recent changes in cookie usage, and privacy legislation) can create challenges for ad tech companies like TTD. *We have considered this risk and believe that TTD has been transparent and effective in addressing these concerns. Nevertheless, this remains a risk, particularly as regulations evolve, and is reflected in our moderate moat rating.*


**Conclusion:**

TTD is a well-managed company with a narrow moat in a dynamic industry.  While the company has significant growth potential, competition and macroeconomic uncertainty make valuation challenging.  Based on our DCF analysis and using a combination of probability weighting of scenarios, a fair value estimate of $50 billion reflects our pessimistic assumptions and our view about TTD's fair value at this time.  Our valuation is significantly below the current market capitalization.  Investors should wait for more attractive valuation levels before investing in TTD.  The final price per share can vary depending on share count, including employee stock options (you may be surprised...).
