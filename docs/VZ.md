## Verizon Communications (VZ) | Moat: 2 / 5 | Valuation: $126 Billion

Verizon operates in a highly competitive and mature telecommunications industry, primarily in the United States. Its core business involves providing wireless and wireline communication services, primarily to businesses and consumers. Its main revenue streams are wireless service, broadband and other wireline services, and other (media and other businesses).  


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenue Distribution (2023):** The company derives its revenues primarily from two segments: Consumer (56%) and Business (44%).
* **Industry Trends:** The telecommunications industry is mature and consolidating. There is intense competition, particularly in the wireless segment. Technological advancements necessitate ongoing investments to keep up and upgrade network infrastructure, which can reduce profitability.
* **Margins:** Margins have been relatively stable in recent years, though competition exerts pressure. The wireless business typically exhibits higher operating margins than the wireline business.
* **Capital Expenditures:** Capital expenditures are substantial due to the need to build and maintain network infrastructure.

**Moat Analysis:**

Verizon's narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5 stems primarily from its large size and scale, which confer certain cost advantages in the telecommunications industry. These advantages are, however, becoming less formidable over time.

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):**  While Verizon has a well-known brand, it's arguable whether it holds substantial pricing power. Brand loyalty in the telecom industry is relatively low, and consumers often switch providers based on price and promotions.
* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs for consumers in the wireless business are low. Consumers can easily switch carriers, albeit with some effort. Business customers, however, may experience higher switching costs due to integrated systems and contracts.
* **Network Effect:** The network effect for Verizon is limited. The value of its network is tied to coverage and quality rather than the number of users, making it difficult for the network effect to create a sustainable competitive advantage. 
* **Cost Advantage:** Verizon's extensive network and infrastructure does create a cost advantage. However, this advantage is eroding as smaller competitors are being acquired by larger firms, and as new technologies emerge, lowering barriers to entry. Regulatory actions can also impact costs and profitability.

Overall, while Verizon's scale affords it some protection from competition, the highly competitive nature of the industry and the low switching costs make it difficult for the company to sustain high returns on capital for extended periods, justifying a narrow moat rating.

**Valuation:**

To value Verizon, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is employed, using free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  1% terminal growth rate (in line with long-run US nominal GDP growth), and revenue growth declining to stable levels within 10 years.
* **Margins:** Operating margins will remain at current levels, assuming current competitive dynamics are here to stay.
* **Reinvestment:**  Reinvestment rates calculated from latest reports to be roughly 12% on average.
* **Cost of Capital:** 7.56% Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (risk-free rate: 3.8%, equity risk premium: 5.7%, beta: 0.92, marginal tax rate: 23%) 

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Free Cash Flow (FCFF) for 10 Years.** (See Verizon 10k filings for data used to build model.  Details available in provided document)
2. **Estimate Terminal Value:** Using the terminal growth rate and a conservative return on invested capital in perpetuity of 8.8%, calculate terminal value using perpetuity growth formula.
3. **Discount Cash Flows and Terminal Value to Present Value:** Using the calculated WACC (7.56%), discount future cash flows and terminal value back to the present.
4. **Sum Discounted Cash Flows:** Add the present values of the cash flows and the terminal value to arrive at enterprise value.
5. **Identify and Value Nonoperating Assets:** In Verizon's case, these assets are significant and must be valued and added to the value of operations. (See financial filings for data used.)
6. **Estimate Total Enterprise Value:** Sum the value of operating assets, nonoperating assets to arrive at the total enterprise value.
7. **Value Debt and Equity Equivalents:** In Verizon's case, its financials are complex with a range of non-equity claims. These items must be valued and accounted for. (See financial filings for data used). 
8. **Estimate Equity Value:** Subtract the values of non-equity claims from the total enterprise value to get equity value.
9. **Calculate Value per Share:** Divide the resulting equity value by the number of diluted shares outstanding.

**Valuation Results:**

Based on these pessimistic assumptions, the calculated DCF equity value for Verizon is approximately $126 billion, representing a modest discount to its current market value (around $140b at the time of the latest filings). This valuation suggests that Verizon is slightly overvalued, reinforcing a cautious outlook.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Uncertainty:**  This valuation, like any valuation, is subject to considerable uncertainty, especially in light of competitive pressures. 
* **Sensitivity:** Changes in key assumptions, such as revenue growth, margins, or the cost of capital, can significantly affect the valuation.
* **Management:** Management quality plays a crucial role in determining whether or not companies can deliver long-term value.
