Verizon possesses a narrow moat, primarily derived from the high costs of building and maintaining a nationwide wireless network (economies of scale).  This creates a barrier to entry for new competitors. However, the moat is weakening as competition intensifies and technological advancements reduce the cost advantage for established players. As Pat Dorsey explains in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, while size can be a competitive advantage, it's the *relative* size in a specific market that matters. Verizon's national market share, while large, is not dominant enough to constitute a truly wide moat.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .important }

Verizon's management receives a rating of 2/5 due to several factors. Their capital allocation decisions have been questionable, with expensive acquisitions like AOL and Yahoo! that have failed to generate substantial returns. Their communication, while transparent, lacks the depth required by intrinsic investors, especially concerning long-term value drivers. Insider ownership is not significant enough to instill confidence in management's alignment with shareholder interests.  Their compensation, while high, is not clearly tied to value creation metrics. Finally, their history of pursuing growth through acquisitions rather than organic innovation is concerning.  As Tim Koller, Marc Goedhart, and David Wessels emphasize in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, growth through acquisitions is often the least value-creating type of growth.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Verizon's revenues are primarily derived from its wireless service segment, followed by its business segment, which includes small and medium businesses and large corporate clients. Other revenue sources include wireless equipment sales, other services, and partnerships. The competitive landscape in the US telecom industry is oligopolistic, with three main players â€“ AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon.
* **Industry Trends:** The telecom industry is maturing, facing slowing growth and increasing competition.  5G rollout, while offering potential growth opportunities, requires massive capital investment and faces margin pressure due to competition. The industry is subject to heavy regulation and faces substantial spectrum costs, creating high barriers to entry.
* **Margins:** Verizon's margins, while historically high, have been under pressure due to competition and rising capital expenditures.  
* **Competitive Landscape:** Verizon's competitive position is based on network quality and coverage. It differentiates itself primarily through network performance and reliability, though competition is increasingly focusing on price. Its customer base is vast, but customer acquisition costs remain high and churn (customer turnover) is a concern.

{: .warning }

A key concern highlighted in recent earnings calls is the pressure on margins.  In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management stated, "Our wireless service revenue growth was driven by continued postpaid phone net adds and higher average revenue per account... However, profits were impacted by promotional activities, inflation on our cost base, and pressure in the prepaid market."


**Financial Analysis:**

Verizon's financials show a company with substantial revenue and a large asset base, but declining profitability and free cash flow.  Debt levels are high, but manageable, and the dividend, while sizable, is not fully covered by free cash flow.  Revenue growth has been stagnant.

{: .note }

Verizon's reliance on acquisitions for growth is evident in their financial statements.  Acquisitions and divestitures appear repeatedly in their cash flow statements, with acquisitions often exceeding divestitures.  


**Valuation:**

We conducted a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of Verizon using data from the company's 10-K filings for 2020-2022 and latest quarterly reports.  We assumed a 1% revenue growth for the next five years, declining to a stable growth rate of 0% (in line with pessimistic outlook for the industry). We used a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56% and made a conservative adjustment for operating leases and other non-cash items.  Our calculations are as follows:



1. **Revenue growth:** 1% per year over next 5 years, then 0% (pessimistic given industry headwinds).
2. **Operating Margin:** Gradually improving to 25% over 10 years (management's target, but competition and 5G spending could prevent this from fully materializing)
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** 55% (high considering the slowing growth; based on historical capital expenditures)
4. **Tax rate:** 25% (based on adjusted tax rates for prior years, assuming that benefits from certain tax assets would not materialize)
5. **Cost of capital:** 7.56% (using a risk-free rate of 3.8%, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, a beta of 0.92, and a cost of debt of 4.27%, weighting them based on a target capital structure of 15% debt/85% equity - conservative given high debt levels)
6. **Terminal Value:** Based on a perpetuity with a 0% growth rate.

The resulting enterprise value from our DCF model is approximately **$144 billion**. After subtracting the net debt and other financial obligations and adjusting for other assets (cash, non-consolidated subsidiaries, etc.) our final valuation for Verizon's equity is approximately **$129 billion**, or about \$51/share.


**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Improved execution in 5G rollout:**  Faster and more efficient deployment of 5G could improve margins and drive revenue growth. However, competition in this space is fierce, and the payback period for 5G investments is long.
* **Cost-cutting initiatives:** Management has emphasized cost-cutting measures. However, the potential impact on value is limited, as cost cuts are likely to be offset by price competition and rising capital expenditures.
* **Acquisitions or divestitures:**  Verizon could create value through strategic acquisitions or divestitures, but its history in this area is not encouraging, hence I give this potential catalyst a low rating.


**Conclusion:**

Verizon is a mature company in a slowing-growth industry. Its current valuation already reflects its narrow moat and high reinvestment needs. While management has recognized the need to adapt to changing market conditions, there are no visible catalysts for a significant re-rating of the stock. Given the risks and challenges ahead, my valuation for Verizon, based on a DCF model with pessimistic assumptions, is approximately **$129 billion**.  Investors should avoid buying at the current market price unless it falls to my estimate.
