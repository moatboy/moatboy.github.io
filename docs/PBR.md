Petrobras, a partially state-owned Brazilian integrated oil and gas company, presents a complex valuation challenge due to its dependence on commodity prices, political influences, and a history of scandals. While the company has displayed improved profitability in recent years, a strict, pessimistic, and skeptical approach reveals a narrow moat and several concerns regarding management.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Petrobras's moat primarily stems from its scale and cost advantages in the Brazilian oil and gas market.  These advantages, however, are not insurmountable.

* **Cost Advantages:** As a large integrated company, Petrobras enjoys economies of scale in oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and distribution.  These cost advantages are particularly potent in deepwater exploration, where the company has significant expertise.  However, as oil prices have come down and excess profitability has emerged, the company's cost advantage has narrowed considerably as competitors are focusing on developing newer technologies to compete with Petrobras (seen in recent earnings calls). 
* **Scale:** Petrobras is the dominant player in the Brazilian oil and gas market. This scale provides negotiating leverage with suppliers and customers, and also creates a barrier to entry given the significant capital investment needed to compete at scale. However, the Brazilian government's substantial ownership stake introduces political and regulatory risks that can erode the moat, as seen in the past with government interventions affecting pricing and production. Additionally, new legislation has opened the oil and gas sector in Brazil for foreign companies. 

**Management (2/5):**

Petrobras's management quality raises concerns, despite the company's recent improved financial performance.

* **History:** The Lava Jato scandal and other corruption controversies significantly damaged the company's reputation and raised questions about management's integrity (as seen in Michael Burry's emphasis on examining not only how the business makes money but also the people running the business). This is something that requires a great deal of caution, as mentioned in *The Intelligent Investor*).  While some executives involved in these scandals have been replaced, the lingering effects of these events, such as significant legal costs, continue to weigh on the company.
* **Capital Allocation:** The company's history of large investments in capacity expansion and downstream projects has not always yielded attractive returns on capital, as mentioned in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*. For example, The company has spent billions of dollars in deep water drilling and exploration projects, but not always at attractive returns.  (as seen in Petrobras's annual reports). Further, Petrobras's forays into areas like fertilizer production and biofuels have yielded mixed results.
* **Communication:**  While recent annual reports and earnings calls have provided more transparency about the company's financials and strategy, there's still a lack of detailed information about the performance of individual business segments. This opacity makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of management's capital allocation decisions and understand the company's competitive position in each segment. (as pointed out in *The Little Book of Valuation*).
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to both financial and operational metrics, though details are not readily available in public disclosures. (Although there are annual performance awards based on the company's results, the compensation is high compared to the average Brazilian). Further research is needed to assess whether compensation is appropriately aligned with shareholder value creation. 

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **New discoveries and expanding production, including offshore and pre-salt.** (In Q3 2020 conference call, CEO commented on the success of exploration and production, stating that the increase was mainly due to the new FPSO Carioca in the Búzios Field. The Búzios and the pre-salt fields will continue to be major profit drivers in the next few years).
* **Oil prices:** Petrobras remains a commodity company, and its share price is highly sensitive to oil and gas price movements.  A sustained increase in oil prices would significantly improve the company's profitability and cash flow, making the current share price look cheap.
* **Continued deleveraging:** Petrobras has successfully reduced its debt burden in recent years, which improves its financial health and reduces its risk profile. Further deleveraging would improve investor confidence.
* **Operational improvements and cost reductions:** The company has focused on streamlining operations and reducing costs.  Successful execution on these initiatives would boost margins and earnings, enhancing profitability.
* **Strategic partnerships and divestments:** (In recent earnings calls, CEO mentioned that the company was considering divestments as a way to shore up its finances and focus on its core business).  Petrobras is pursuing strategic partnerships and divestments in noncore assets.  These transactions could generate cash and allow the company to focus on its most profitable businesses.
* **Reduced political risk:** A more stable and market-oriented regulatory environment in Brazil would reduce uncertainty and increase investor confidence, improving the company's valuation.


**Valuation ($81 Billion):**

Petrobras was valued by computing the enterprise value in August 2023 by using discounted cash flow methodology. We use a 5-year forecast period and a terminal growth rate in line with the current market implied expected GDP growth rate of 4.45%.


**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Assumed 5% annual revenue growth for the first five years, then declining to 4.45% to reflect Petrobras' mature company status and a moderately pessimistic outlook for the industry.
* **Operating Margin:**  Forecasted a gradual increase in the operating margin over the next five years as the company improves efficiency. Assumed 10% operating margin in terminal year based on analysis of competitors' margins and a moderately pessimistic outlook.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Estimated the reinvestment rate based on historical capital expenditures and the forecast of incremental capital needs to fund growth.  Assumed 20% reinvestment rate in terminal year.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Estimated at 9% based on the risk-free rate, a risk premium for the energy sector, and a country risk premium for Brazil, in line with Damodaran's suggestion to explicitly model risk. Assumed the debt-to-equity ratio will remain at about 30% in the long run and applied an APV model to account for the tax savings from interest payments
* **Failure rate:** Assuming the company might fail. Thus, I set the distress sale value to $0 per share using the bankruptcy probability values provided in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*.
* **Normalization:** Assumed normalization of earnings, refining margins, and oil prices (used a normalized oil price of $80 to value the company and its cash flows. This number reflects industry expert estimates and considers recent trends and historical data.) by 2025 in line with Graham's emphasis on normalizing earnings over the cycle.


**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to the Firm:**  Computed for each year using the following formula: FCF = (EBIT(1 - Tax rate)) - Reinvestment
2. **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the terminal growth rate and the cost of capital.
3. **Present Value of FCF:** Discounted each year's FCF and the terminal value back to the present using the cost of capital.
4. **Value of Operating Assets:** Sum of the present values of FCF.
5. **Enterprise Value:** Value of operating assets plus value of non-operating assets (cash and marketable securities).
6. **Value of Equity:** Enterprise value minus debt.
7. **Value per Share:** Value of equity divided by the number of shares outstanding.

>The valuation resulted in a per-share value of $13.46. This is below the current market price, implying that Petrobras is slightly overvalued.  It is crucial to note that this valuation result is based upon estimates of how long the company's revenues and earnings will continue to grow before facing competition. As discussed in the 2023 earnings call, the company is experiencing margin pressure, and management was particularly pessimistic on production and refining.

**Discussion:**

Petrobras's future performance depends heavily on macroeconomic factors, particularly oil prices, and political and regulatory developments in Brazil.  The company is also susceptible to additional corruption scandals and operational disruptions, which could damage investor confidence.


>In Q2 2023 earnings call, CEO commented on refining segment, stating that it had faced significant downward pressure because of a supply overhang and a fall in gasoline and diesel spreads.

Given these risks and uncertainties, a pessimistic valuation approach is warranted.

>In the Q1 2023 earnings call, CEO commented on exploration and production, stating that production was below plan. Although the company attributed the shortfall to production and operational issues, which have now been resolved, it nevertheless provides another reason to be cautious when doing valuation and to consider a wide range of outcomes.


**Additional Notes:**

>Given the past corruption scandals, it is likely that Petrobras is being given greater scrutiny. Hence, we also took into account qualitative factors that are crucial in assessing the quality of a company’s management, such as insider ownership, communication, capital allocation decisions, and reputation.

* Petrobras's relatively low insider ownership raises concerns about management's alignment with shareholders. (As discussed in Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder letters, managers who own a lot of stock are likely to think more like owners when making decisions).
* While Petrobras' recent emphasis on transitioning to a low carbon company aligns with global trends and could provide a significant catalyst for growth, significant capital and successful project execution will be essential to the company's long-term success.
* Further research is needed to gain deeper insight into the profitability, competitive landscape, and management quality of Petrobras' various segments.

>In recent earnings call, CEO commented on low carbon energy projects stating that Petrobras will continue to invest in sustainable energy projects to ensure long term profit.
