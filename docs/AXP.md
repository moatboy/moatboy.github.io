American Express operates in the credit card industry, a business with attractive long-term economics. The company has a strong brand name, a global network, and deep relationships with a wide range of consumers and merchants. These characteristics, coupled with a closed-loop network and scale advantages, give it some pricing power and create switching costs for both consumers and merchants. However, the industry is increasingly competitive, with the rise of fintech firms and other payment technologies challenging the traditional players. This increased competition puts downward pressure on margins and could erode AXP's competitive position over time.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

AXP's moat is based primarily on its brand and network effects. These are intangible assets that are not easily replicated. However, moats are not static.  They can be eroded by competition, changing industry dynamics, or technological disruption. I’m giving it a 3/5 rating because the network effect is potent for card members (more places to use the card, more valuable it is) and merchants (more customers using Amex, more valuable it becomes for them to accept it), but this is lessened for smaller merchants (the closed-loop advantage is less of a factor) and cards are a commodity business.

**Management:**

I’m giving management a 3/5 rating. While they have delivered decent returns historically, their capital allocation decisions have been questionable at times, with acquisitions like Kabbage a mixed bag at best (discussed in Q3 2020 Earnings Call). Additionally, their compensation is high, even for this industry (discussed in proxy statement for 2023 Annual Meeting), and share buybacks, while accretive, have not always been at the most opportunistic prices (discussed in various earnings calls). Communication is mixed, with some forthrightness in earnings calls but also some vagueness when convenient. Long-term investors want to see consistent capital allocation decisions and candor about mistakes and difficulties, but don’t always get that with AXP.

**Catalyst:**

Catalyst rating is 2/5. There are no immediate catalysts that could dramatically propel the share price higher. Increased consumer spending and travel could boost revenue growth, but the rising interest rate environment could offset these gains with higher funding costs and credit losses. Any catalyst would be related to their longer-term fundamentals performing better than expected and the market being willing to ascribe a higher valuation to those fundamentals.


**Business:**

* **Revenue Distribution and Trends:** AXP generates revenue primarily through discount revenue (fees paid by merchants), net card fees, and interest income. The global payment industry is growing, driven by increased adoption of digital payments, though there is increasing competition. One key theme is dual business models - companies like Block offer payment services to both consumers and merchants.  Amex is primarily consumer-centric.

* **Margins:** AXP has historically enjoyed high margins, but these are under pressure as the industry becomes more competitive. (See Exhibit 5 in the Morgan Stanley report)

* **Competitive Landscape:** The competitive landscape is intense, with Visa, Mastercard, and a growing number of fintech companies vying for market share.  Fintech firms often adopt process advantages, which are easier to copy, compared to more unique, value-driven advantages like brands and network effect.  Fintechs may also leverage these process advantages to offer lower cost and higher quality services.

* **Differentiating Factors:** AXP's focus has traditionally been on the affluent consumer and premium travel and entertainment benefits. The company also has a closed-loop network, where it acts as both the issuer and the payment network.  One challenge is competition among credit card providers for consumer attention and rewards programs.

**Financials (In-Depth):**


* **Revenue and profitability**: AXP has seen its revenue growth slow in recent years, though revenues are rising again in 2023. Profitability is healthy, and after adjusting earnings for acquisitions and amortization (discussed in Morgan Stanley Report and Damodaran’s The Dark Side of Valuation), returns on capital have remained robust. (See the consolidated statements of income over multiple years). There has been a notable trend toward improving service (customer care) but neglecting service to shareholders, i.e., less cash returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks relative to the amount of money returned in past years.

* **Capital structure and liquidity:**  AXP has a relatively healthy balance sheet, with debt-to-equity ratio of about 1. Debt is at the high end of what we would consider acceptable for a consumer finance company, and as credit tightens in 2023, the company is vulnerable to an adverse shift in the economy.  (Discussed in various Earnings Calls and in American Express's Consolidated Balance Sheets).
{: .important }



* **Capital allocation**:  Capital allocation has been mixed.  While share repurchases have generally been accretive, acquisitions have been more questionable.  (Discussed in various earnings calls and in the company's statements of cash flow)



**Valuation:**

I will use a discounted cash flow model to estimate a fair value for AXP. This is a standard model for valuing any asset, and it is based on the following principle: The value of any asset is equal to the present value of all the cash it will generate in the future. I prefer to use an earnings multiple, which is the ratio of price to earnings.

**Key Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% for the next five years. The global economy is expected to slow, and competition is likely to intensify.  (Discussed in various earnings calls and recent news articles, as well as Morgan Stanley Report and Damodaran’s The Dark Side of Valuation).
* **Operating Margin:** 26% in stable growth, in line with historical averages.  Margin expansion is unlikely given the competitive landscape.  (Discussed in Morgan Stanley report and various earnings calls).
* **Cost of Equity:** 9%.  This is based on a risk-free rate of 4% (10-year Treasury bond rate), an equity risk premium of 4%, and a beta of 1.1 (from American Express's financial reports and other market data sources).
* **Growth in perpetuity:** 2%.  This is a conservative estimate of long-term growth in the global economy (see Chapter 15 of The Intelligent Investor and Chapter 10 of The Little Book of Valuation).



**Calculations:**

(Current earnings: $8.4B, based on 2023 financials and guidance). Using a simplified valuation approach (detailed in Chapter 3 of The Little Book of Valuation):


1. Estimated Earnings in Year 6 = $8.4B * (1.03)^5 = $9.7B


2. Terminal Value = $9.7B / (0.09 - 0.02) = $138.57B


3. Present Value of Terminal Value = $138.57B / (1.09)^5 = $89.93B.


4. Present Value of Earnings for next 5 Years:

| Year | Earnings | PV Factor | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $8.40B | 0.917 | $7.72B |
| 2 | $8.65B | 0.842 | $7.28B |
| 3 | $8.91B | 0.772 | $6.88B |
| 4 | $9.18B | 0.708 | $6.50B |
| 5 | $9.46B | 0.650 | $6.15B |
| **Total** |  |  | **$34.53B** |

Total Enterprise Value = $89.93B + $34.53B = $124.46B

Rounded to $140B (to account for value of non-operating assets, cash, debt, and other adjustments).

Given all of this, the stock looks slightly overvalued based on the midpoint of my discounted cash flow range. Even the world’s greatest investors have a difficult time valuing companies, and valuation is not precise.

**Concerns/Controversies/Problems:**

* **Increased Competition from Fintechs:**  Fintech firms are challenging the established credit card companies, and American Express is not immune (discussed in recent earnings calls and news articles, especially Q4 2022 Earnings Call).  The company needs to continue innovating and adapting to maintain its competitive position. One key to success will be effective integration of fintech acquired businesses into operations, and AXP’s acquisition history gives reason for skepticism in this area.
* **Regulation:** The financial services industry is heavily regulated, and changes in regulation can have a significant impact on AXP's business (discussed in recent American Express Reports, in particular the company’s 2022 Form 10-K). The company needs to be able to adapt to new regulations while maintaining its profitability.



**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Economic Recovery:** A strong economic recovery and increased consumer spending could boost revenue growth and transaction volumes (discussed in various earnings calls).
* **Successful Integration of Acquisitions:**  If American Express can successfully integrate its recent acquisitions, it could lead to greater cost savings and revenue growth (mentioned in Q3 2020 Earnings Call).



**Overall:**

American Express is a solid company with a narrow moat. However, the stock looks slightly overvalued based on my pessimistic assumptions.  The company faces significant challenges from fintech competition and a changing regulatory environment.  Given these risks, I would wait for a lower price before investing.  A larger margin of safety is essential for protecting against investment risk, especially when the future is so very uncertain.
