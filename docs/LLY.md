{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Lilly's moat is primarily based on **intangible assets**, specifically patents and a strong brand name. Patents provide temporary monopolies on drugs, enabling Lilly to charge premium prices. However, as Graham warns in *The Intelligent Investor*, patents have a finite life and can be challenged legally.  Lilly’s history shows a pattern of successful drug development and FDA approvals for new treatments, including Mounjaro, its current star. This, coupled with data and biologics protection, gives some assurance of continued patent protection for existing and new products, creating a mini-monopoly. Furthermore, successful products are often interconnected (e.g., one medicine is used for an earlier stage of a disease, and another is used for a more advanced stage), which strengthens Lilly’s competitive position by creating **customer switching costs**, thus enhancing the moat. 

However, as Pat Dorsey highlights in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brands are not necessarily moats.  While Lilly's brand is well-known, particularly among patients and healthcare professionals, it does not have the same pricing power as, say, a luxury brand. This limits Lilly's ability to extract a price premium. Thus, Lilly’s moat is not as wide as it once was due to increasing competitive pressures on its legacy drugs, especially from generics. Overall, I rate the moat as a 3/5, with **narrow** width as defined by Morningstar because of the increasing competition and the nature of the industry.

**Management:**

I rate Lilly's management as a 3/5.

* **Capital Allocation:** While Lilly has made some successful acquisitions (e.g., Loxo Oncology), it has also made questionable investments, such as pouring capital into areas where it has no competitive advantage.  As an example,  during the late 1990s, Lilly blew more than $3 billion in losses in e-commerce ventures, which had nothing to do with the firm’s core business (Q3 2000 earnings call).  More recently, there are concerns about Lilly’s R&D expense. While necessary for innovation, there's no guarantee of success.  As mentioned in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, a high ROIC is a function of not just high margins, but also how much the company spends on research and development, relative to competitors.  Currently Lilly spends roughly 27% of revenues on R&D. It seems to be high relative to its peers but there’s no evidence of a disproportionate advantage. (Q3 2022 earnings call). 
* **Communication:** Management appears to be reasonably transparent with investors, providing detailed information on its pipeline, financials, and strategy during earnings calls and in its SEC filings. However, like many other managements, they are sometimes overly optimistic about the future.  For example, in early 1999, management was already planning for the introduction of a diabetes drug that was not approved for six more years. (Q2 1999 earnings call)
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation seems to be high. In Q3 2023, executive compensation was roughly 10% of the operating income. (Q3 2023 10-Q). 
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is low.  Insiders hold less than 1% of outstanding shares, (Q3 2023 10-Q)  making one question management’s incentive to run the business effectively for shareholders over the long term, as Graham emphasizes in *The Intelligent Investor*.

**Catalyst:**

Lilly's catalyst rating is a 4/5. The company has a strong pipeline of new drugs in development, several of which have blockbuster potential.  Its key growth driver is Mounjaro, its drug for diabetes and obesity. The drug continues to meet with remarkable success with FDA approvals, increased insurance coverage, and a fast expansion in the obesity market. The drug’s market share in the obesity space is already 26%, and it is growing very rapidly. (Q2 2024 earnings call).  There’s a great opportunity for Mounjaro to expand internationally in the future, given its effectiveness in treating obesity. (Q3 2023 Earnings call).  Lilly is already in Phase 3 trials for its Alzheimer’s drug, donanemab, which has shown remarkable results so far. (Q3 2023 earnings call) FDA approval for this drug will be a big catalyst for the company.

**Valuation:**

I used a **three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model** to value Lilly, using consolidated data from the firm’s SEC filings over the past few years (2019 to 2023).   A three-stage model allows for more flexibility and accuracy in the forecasting process. 

I also incorporated insights from Damodaran’s *The Dark Side of Valuation*. Specifically, I started by thinking about the future and then worked my way backward to link my assumptions about Lilly’s future performance to its current performance.

{: .note }

Using inputs derived from Lilly’s financial statements and assuming a perpetual growth rate of 3% with a conservative terminal return on invested capital of 10%, my model generated a value of roughly $340 Billion for Lilly as of December 31, 2023.

**Key Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Revenue Growth:** Lilly's revenues have been growing at a robust rate over the past few years, primarily driven by Mounjaro. For my valuation, I assumed that revenue growth will decrease from an average of roughly 22% over the next five years to 6% through year 10, and finally fall to 3% in perpetuity. These declining growth rates are consistent with the assumption that competition will intensify as rival drugs are introduced to the obesity market. 


2. **Operating Margin:** Lilly's operating margin has been volatile over the past few years, primarily due to the high level of R&D expense. For my valuation, I assumed that its margin will be roughly 17.5% in the next five years and 19% through year 10, reaching to 20% in perpetuity. These figures are based on historical averages for the industry, with a slight adjustment upward to reflect Lilly's current strength in the diabetes and obesity markets.


3. **Reinvestment Rate:** I assumed that Lilly will continue to reinvest heavily in R&D to maintain its competitive advantage. I estimated its reinvestment rate based on capital expenditures + R&D, both scaled to revenues. Lilly’s reinvestment rate has been very high — more than 100% — over the past few years, due to the enormous investments in Mounjaro. In my valuation I assume that the reinvestment rate will fall from an average of 60% for the first five years, to 40% through year 10, and 30% thereafter. This declining rate of reinvestment is consistent with the assumption that Mounjaro’s profits will begin to moderate as the obesity market matures, and competition intensifies. 


4. **Cost of Capital:** I estimated Lilly's cost of capital using a weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) approach. My WACC assumptions are as follows: Risk-free rate = 4%, Cost of debt = 6% after tax,  Equity risk premium = 4.5%, Beta = 0.9, Debt ratio = 20%, Effective tax rate = 25%. 


5. **Terminal Value:** I estimated Lilly's terminal value using a perpetuity growth model. I assumed a perpetual growth rate of 3%, which is based on the long-term growth rate of the global economy. I also assumed a conservative terminal return on invested capital of 10%, which reflects increased competition in the pharmaceutical industry. The resulting terminal value is about $170 Billion. 


6. **Cash:** I added back Lilly's current cash balance of $8.2 Billion to my valuation. 


7. **Debt:** I subtracted Lilly's current debt balance of $20.7 Billion from my valuation.



**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

One potential concern for Lilly is the patent litigation it faces on several of its drugs.  The latest patent litigation is against two drugs for diabetes - Jardiance and Trulicity. The litigation challenges their patents on these drugs, and if successful, could lead to the early entry of generics. The management doesn’t seem to be very concerned, stating that these drugs are only a tiny percentage of the company’s total sales — less than 2% (Q3 2022 earnings call).  But lawsuits can be unpredictable.


**Financial Analysis:**

Lilly's financials are solid, with strong revenue growth and decent margins. However, the company's high level of R&D expense weighs on its earnings and cash flow. One thing that made Lilly a particularly attractive target for investors in the recent past was the fact that it had done so well — more than $1 billion in annual profits (Q4 1997 earnings call) — without needing to take on substantial amounts of debt. (Q3 1997 earnings call)


**Conclusion:**

Lilly is a well-run company with a solid business. However, the company's high valuation leaves little room for error, especially given its exposure to patent challenges and competition.  Lilly’s future hinges on the continued success of Mounjaro and the success of its late-stage pipeline. If Lilly can successfully bring its new drugs to market, the stock has significant upside potential. However, given the risks and uncertainties facing the company, I would wait for a pullback before initiating a position.
