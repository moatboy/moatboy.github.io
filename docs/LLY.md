## Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) | Moat: 3 / 5 | Valuation: $338 Billion

Eli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, and markets prescription drugs for human and animal health. Its products are sold in approximately 120 countries worldwide, with the majority of sales occurring in the United States. LLY operates in a single business segmentâ€”the pharmaceutical industry. 

**Business Overview**

LLY focuses on developing and commercializing innovative medicines in various therapeutic areas, including diabetes, immunology, oncology, and neuroscience.  The company's success is heavily reliant on research and development (R&D), which is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. LLY faces intense competition from other large multinational pharmaceutical companies, as well as smaller, specialized biotech firms. Patents protect many of the company's key products, but these patents have finite lives, and generic competition eventually emerges.

**Moat Analysis**

LLY's moat stems primarily from intangible assets, specifically its patents and brand name recognition. However, applying a pessimistic and skeptical lens, I assign a rating of 3/5. Here's the justification:

* **Intangible Assets (Patents):** Patents provide temporary monopolies, allowing drug companies to charge premium prices. However, as highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, patents are not always a durable source of competitive advantage due to their finite life and potential legal challenges. While LLY has a strong track record of innovation, the inevitable expiration of patents and subsequent generic competition put downward pressure on prices and margins, thus eroding profits.  As outlined in the Morgan Stanley report on moats, pharmaceutical firms typically need to show substantial improvements in economic profit from innovative drugs to offset this patent expiration.

* **Intangible Assets (Brand Name):** LLY benefits from brand recognition among physicians and patients.  However, brand loyalty in pharmaceuticals can be fickle, particularly when cheaper generics become available.  Doctors are generally cost-conscious, especially given the pricing pressures from insurance companies and government payers.  The trust factor for branded drugs is not as strong compared to consumer goods, thereby limiting LLY's brand power and consequently the moat.

* **Mistaken Moats:**  As Dorsey points out in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, great products and talented management, while desirable, are not structural competitive advantages by themselves.  LLY has a talented management team and has generated high returns on capital historically.  However, even top managers are at the mercy of a difficult industry, such as the U.S. airline industry. LLY operates in a challenging industry, so even with the best management, success is not guaranteed.  Additionally,  the pharmaceutical industry as a whole has seen a trend toward large acquisitions and mergers to sustain growth, which may create a one-off return for shareholders but does not indicate profitability going forward.  Hence, good management in the context of the pharmaceuticals industry does not necessarily constitute a moat, according to Dorsey.

* **Eroding Moats:**  Technological change can severely damage or even destroy competitive advantages in any industry. LLY is at some risk of facing technological disruption, although such changes often take longer in the pharmaceutical industry. A bigger worry for investors in companies with moats is the company's self-inflicted wounds. As outlined in the Morgan Stanley report on moats, investing wisely is about being able to anticipate which future ventures will earn an attractive return on investment on incremental invested capital.  Given the high-growth nature of the drug market and its uncertain business environment, it remains to be seen whether LLY is disciplined in their pursuit of growth, limiting their investment in high-growth businesses that are not attractive from a profitability standpoint.

**Valuation**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, combined with the updated comments from Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, I estimate a fair value of approximately \$338 billion for LLY. This valuation incorporates a pessimistic outlook on future earnings and accounts for the considerable risk and uncertainty inherent in the pharmaceutical industry.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  In recent annual filings, LLY has been reporting modest sales growth, and with some pessimism about the near future, 4% annual revenue growth for the first five years followed by 2% long-run growth, a more conservative figure than overall economic growth.
* **Target Operating Margin:** LLY's cost of goods sold has been consistently between 25-30% of sales, and we assume 25%. As LLY spends heavily on sales & marketing and research & development (60% of sales in 2023), assuming that these costs will shrink to an optimistic 53% of revenue by year 5. Adding 7% operating expenses (as a percentage of revenue), leaves LLY with a target operating margin of 15%.
* **Reinvestment:** LLY will continue to reinvest heavily, so we assume a reinvestment rate of 95% for the first five years gradually falling to 80% in the terminal year.
* **Cost of Capital:** LLY has an equity beta of 0.72, which is somewhat similar to the industry average of 0.69, which we use to calculate a WACC of 8.6%.
* **Failure Probability:**  Since LLY is a mature company, not an emerging market company, and maintains a credit rating of AA, we ignore any risk of failure for this valuation. 

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** FCF is projected for the next 10 years, incorporating the assumptions above. Given the long-run revenue growth and returns on incremental invested capital being lower than the WACC, FCF becomes negative after year 10.
2. **Terminal Value:** A perpetuity is used to value the cash flows beyond year 10 and discounted to year 10.
3. **Present Value:** The present values of the FCF and terminal value are summed to arrive at the value of operating assets.
4. **Non-operating Assets:** These are small and valued at book value.
5. **Debt and Equity:**  These are based upon market values (not shown here).
6. **Value per Share:** The equity value is divided by the number of shares outstanding.

**Sensitivity Analysis and Scenarios**

The valuation is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions about long-term growth and return on capital. Even minor changes in these inputs can lead to drastically different valuations. To address the significant uncertainty, scenario analysis could be used, varying key assumptions (e.g., growth, margins, competition) to create a range of potential outcomes.  For instance, in a more optimistic, expansionary scenario,  faster growth and higher margins in the early years could be assumed. Conversely, in a pessimistic, contractionary scenario, the model might incorporate lower growth, lower margins and higher R&D costs and other expenses.  Then the valuations obtained from the different scenarios would be probability-weighted based on the likelihood of each scenario. Given that LLY faces an uncertain business environment and the pharmaceutical industry in particular is highly competitive, more weight should be given to the pessimistic scenarios.

Given the sensitivity of the valuation to key assumptions and the inherent uncertainty in the pharmaceutical industry, a substantial margin of safety should be demanded before making an investment in LLY. While the current market price may appear superficially to be close to our base-case valuation, the risks associated with long-term investments in the pharmaceutical industry should not be understated, and a price substantially lower than our estimate of intrinsic value would increase the margin of safety and make for a more attractive buying opportunity.
