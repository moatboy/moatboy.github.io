Pessimistic value: $17.1 B

HBAN is a regional bank holding company primarily serving the Midwest. While it possesses some elements of a moat, its strength and durability are limited, hence a rating of 2 out of 5. Its management, rated 3 out of 5, exhibits a blend of strengths and weaknesses. There's some evidence of opportunistic capital allocation, but also signs of potentially excessive focus on short-term targets. Several potential catalysts exist, but their impact is likely to be moderate, resulting in a catalyst rating of 2 out of 5. Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, and taking a pessimistic view of its future, its estimated fair value is $17.1 billion.

**Moat (2/5):**

HBAN's moat stems primarily from its regional presence and established customer relationships. Regional banks often benefit from customer stickiness due to the inconvenience of switching banks (switching costs). HBAN operates in several midwestern states that are not very attractive for larger, national banks. As its CEO Stephen Steinour mentioned in the Q2 2021 Earnings call, HBAN benefits from being an established player in its market and focuses on customer relationships to maintain a competitive edge. However, this moat is narrow and not particularly strong.  Technological advancements are making it easier for customers to switch banks and for new entrants to compete online.  Larger banks, though not directly present in HBAN's markets, could expand into these regions more easily than into other regions, as stated by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth.* HBAN has a limited geographical reach. Unlike larger banks with broader product offerings and national scale, its smaller size limits its ability to compete on price. Also, like many regional banks, HBAN has been trying to establish a stronger presence in faster-growing businesses.  However, the returns in these segments are less certain due to greater competition.

**Management (3/5):**

HBAN's management team exhibits a mixed bag.  

* **Strengths:** The company has a history of consistent profitability (although returns have been declining) and dividend payments, as shown in their 2023 Form 10-K filings. CEO Steinour appears focused on long-term value creation, as evidenced by comments in the Q4 2023 Earnings call emphasizing a disciplined approach to organic growth. There are also some indicators of opportunistic acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Capstone Partners in a seemingly attractive transaction during the downturn in early 2023.
* **Weaknesses:** However, HBAN's capital allocation decisions sometimes appear to be excessively focused on managing earnings per share. For example, in the Q2 2020 Earnings call, management announced the repurchase of $800 million of stock. Just a year later in the 2021 annual report, the buyback was acknowledged as “probably ill-timed.” In many acquisitions, particularly in banking acquisitions, such as the acquisition of TCF Financial Corporation, we see an immediate increase in earnings per share for the acquirer which many financial commentators will celebrate, but a closer look will reveal that if the acquirer had borrowed to boost earnings, the true economic value of the company may have decreased.

**Business:**

HBAN operates in various financial service industries, including retail and commercial banking.  It generates most of its revenues through traditional banking activities.  

* **Revenue Mix:** Interest income from loans and deposits constitutes HBAN's largest revenue source, followed by noninterest income from various fees and services. The loan portfolio is diversified across various loan types, with a substantial portion in commercial real estate. As demonstrated in their 2023 SEC filings, the revenue contribution of non-interest income has been increasing in recent years, which might help to smooth earnings but also increases the company's susceptibility to market fluctuations.
* **Industry Dynamics and Competitive Landscape:** The banking industry is mature and competitive, with larger banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America dominating at a national level. As discussed in the book *Valuation*, scale does matter, though smaller banks can still carve out profitable niches based on geography and customer relationships. While there are some benefits to having regional banks, like HBAN, because of local focus, scale is an important advantage that they don’t have.
* **Margins:** HBAN's net interest margin (NIM), a key profitability measure for banks, has been compressed in recent years because of low interest rates and increased competition.  However, rising interest rates should provide some near-term tailwinds, as evident in the NIM increase reported in the Q3 2023 earnings call, but it is hard to determine whether those profits will actually flow through to shareholders, and there is likely to be even greater compression in margins over time in this mature business. As the Morgan Stanley report emphasizes, persistent performance on high ROIC is the most powerful factor in differentiating winners from other firms.

**Financials:**

HBAN's historical financial performance reveals a company that has been profitable but whose earnings and returns are declining. Its key financial ratios are presented below, as extracted from its SEC filings and earnings calls:

* **Return on Equity (ROE):** Has decreased from double digits a few years ago to around 8% in recent periods (although the Q4 2023 earnings call suggested a potential for recovery).
* **Net Interest Margin (NIM):** Compressed in recent years, trending up recently.
* **Efficiency Ratio:**  Generally stable, though there is some upward pressure.

**Valuation:**

A three-stage DCF model is used to estimate HBAN's intrinsic value. A DCF model is appropriate for valuing banks because it captures the interplay of interest rate risk, leverage, and business risk.


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  5% for the next 5 years, then 3% for the next 10 years, and finally 1% in perpetuity. These assumptions are based on the current economic outlook for the Midwest, taking into account management’s plan to continue on its organic growth strategy.
* **Operating Margin:** Gradually improving over the next 5 years to 27.5%, then declining to 25% in the long run.  This reflects ongoing pressure on NIMs.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  60% for the next 10 years, then 30% in perpetuity.  This reflects the expectation that HBAN will need to reinvest a greater portion of its earnings to maintain growth.
* **Cost of Equity:** Based on the CAPM, using a risk-free rate of 3.8%, an equity risk premium of 4%, and a beta of 1.1.
* **Cost of Debt:**  4.8%, reflecting HBAN's current bond yields, assuming an increase to account for inflation.
* **Tax Rate:**  22%, which reflects the company’s marginal tax rate.
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 1%, consistent with long-run inflation expectations.

**Calculations:**

Using these assumptions, the DCF model generates a present value of $17.1 billion for HBAN's equity.  Given the number of shares outstanding, this translates to a value per share of \$14.33. A detailed valuation is presented in the Excel spreadsheet.

**Catalysts (2/5):**

* **Improving NIM:**  Rising interest rates could boost NIM, but increased competition and ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the banking industry might offset these benefits, as discussed by management in recent earnings calls. As indicated in the Q3 2023 financial statements, the NIM is beginning to turn up, but it’s too early to know whether the trend will continue or whether the market perceives the recent upturn as sustainable.
* **Acquisitions:** There is always the potential for accretive acquisitions, as hinted at by CEO Steinour in the Q2 2024 earnings call. However, a successful acquisition strategy requires not only finding businesses that are available at attractive prices and integrating them without value destruction, but also identifying targets with positive synergies.

**Concerns/Controversies:**

Recent investor concerns revolve around the pace of loan growth, exposure to commercial real estate, and the impact of new banking regulations.  Management addressed these issues in the Q3 2023 Earnings call, emphasizing the quality of its loan book and its plans to navigate the changing regulatory landscape. However, skepticism is warranted given the historical cyclical nature of real estate markets and regulatory risk and the increasing complexities of managing a modern bank. As noted by Micheal Burry’s MSN Money Articles when there is an inverse relationship between market cap and returns, or a rising return on capital with falling returns, then that is where most investors lose money.

**Overall:**

HBAN is a regional bank with a reasonable valuation based upon relatively conservative assumptions, and a history of steady returns. The company faces significant competition and regulatory challenges but appears to be reasonably positioned to navigate them.  However, significant upside potential appears limited given the constraints on its moat and the mixed quality of its management and their allocation decisions. Consequently, a moderate valuation seems warranted.
