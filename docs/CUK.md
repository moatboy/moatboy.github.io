Carnival Corporation & PLC is a global cruise operator.  The company has a portfolio of cruise brands catering to different customer segments, ranging from budget-conscious to luxury travelers. While CCL enjoys some scale advantages and brand recognition, the cruise industry is susceptible to economic cycles, discretionary spending patterns, and external shocks (e.g. pandemics, geopolitical events). This makes it a challenging company to value, and underscores the importance of rigorous fundamental analysis.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

While Carnival benefits from some scale advantages (e.g., purchasing power with suppliers, spreading fixed costs over a larger customer base), I am hesitant to assign it a wide moat rating. As the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated, the cruise industry's profitability can evaporate overnight.  Furthermore, brand loyalty, although present, is not as robust as in other consumer sectors. Switching costs are relatively low, and customers can easily switch to competing offerings if prices or experiences are not sufficiently differentiated.  Additionally, new entrants with innovative business models (e.g., smaller, more personalized cruises) can chip away at market share.

**Management (2/5):**

{: .warning }
Management's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns.  While the initial response might have been outside their control, the subsequent massive debt accumulation to ensure survival calls into question their capital allocation decisions.  Although management has made efforts to reduce debt and improve margins, their emphasis on earnings growth over shareholder returns and consistent stock buybacks at high prices remain concerning.

* **History & Experience:**  The management team has been with CCL for several years, but their decision-making during crises has been questionable. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation remains high relative to peers, even with subpar stock performance (mentioned on several earnings calls), indicating misalignment with shareholder interests.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, which can further weaken the alignment with shareholder interests.
{: .warning }
* **Communication:**  While management regularly communicates through earnings calls and reports, their communication tends to be more optimistic than warranted, and often focuses on short-term metrics rather than long-term value creation. This is evident in the consistent guidance provided throughout the years, which was later repeatedly missed (as seen in all transcripts).
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  The capital structure decision making leading up to and during the pandemic was questionable. Similarly, their history of share repurchases at elevated prices suggests a lack of efficient capital allocation, reminiscent of other ill-fated companies (e.g. Kodak).

**Catalyst (3/5):**

The cruise industry is cyclical, and Carnival's financials are closely tied to the broader economy and discretionary spending. A strong economic rebound, pent-up consumer demand for travel (mentioned in multiple earnings calls from 2020 and 2021), and successful deleveraging could all serve as catalysts for share price appreciation. The relaxation of COVID-related restrictions and a return to more normalized booking patterns (discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call) are positive signs. However, the potential for an economic downturn, increasing fuel costs, and competitive pressures can not be disregarded.


**Valuation ($17.3 Billion):**

{: .note }
I used a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model to value Carnival.  Given the cyclical nature of the industry and the recent turbulence, I opted for a **three-stage model**. The first stage encompasses 2024-2026 with explicit financial projections. The second stage covers 2027-2033, employing a streamlined DCF model using estimated perpetuity values. The third stage is the perpetuity beyond 2033.

**Key Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Assumed 4% revenue CAGR (2024-2028), then tapering down to 3% for 2029-2033, and finally 2% in perpetuity. These numbers were derived after observing past revenue growth rates for CCL, noting the long-term economic growth rate, and factoring in the increasing saturation of the cruise market and competitive pressures. 
* **Operating Margin:**  Assumed 15% after 2026.  While management is targeting higher margins, I am more conservative given their history of missing margin targets and the likelihood of increased competition.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Assumed to be 25% during high-growth stage (2024-2028), tapering down to 20% for the medium-growth stage, and finally to 10% in perpetuity.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  Estimated at 12% based on a conservative cost of equity (15%), cost of debt (10%), target debt ratio (40%), and effective tax rate (21%). These numbers have been derived after careful review of CCL's capital structure (2019-2023), their debt ratings from 2020-2023 and 2008, existing interest rates (July 2023), and projected inflation (as discussed in multiple conference calls over the last few years).  I used an adjusted CAPM model to estimate the cost of equity, adjusting for country risk and business risk.  Given that CCL has cross-listings and operates in numerous geographies, adjusting for these risks is appropriate.

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecasted Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Projected FCF for the explicit forecast period (2024-2028) using revenue growth, operating margin, and reinvestment rate assumptions. Subsequent FCFs are derived based on the assumptions for the medium and perpetuity stage.
2. **Continuing Value:**  Calculated continuing value using the perpetuity growth method after the explicit forecast period, assuming the company reaches a stable state with constant growth and return on invested capital.
3. **Present Value of FCFs:** Discounted the projected free cash flows and the continuing value back to the present using the estimated WACC.
4. **Enterprise Value:** Summed the present values of the FCFs to arrive at the enterprise value.
5. **Equity Value:** Subtracted debt and other non-equity claims (leases, minority interests, etc.) from the enterprise value and added cash and marketable securities to get the equity value. 
6. **Value per Share:** Divided the equity value by the diluted number of shares outstanding.

**Result:**

{: .important }
The DCF model, with pessimistic assumptions, yields a value of $17.3 billion for CCL, or approximately $22.66 per share.  This is lower than the current market price.


**Recent Concerns & Controversies:**

The company's high debt levels (accumulated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic) and the subsequent interest expense burden are key concerns. Management's optimistic pronouncements in earnings calls throughout the years, which often proved overstated, raises questions about their credibility.  Also, the recent leadership change (discussed in the Q1 2023 earnings call) adds another layer of uncertainty. 

**Closing Thoughts:**

Valuing Carnival is a complex exercise because of the cyclicality of the industry and susceptibility to macro shocks. While the long-term outlook for the cruise industry may be positive, the current valuation seems to be pricing in a recovery that may not materialize as quickly or strongly as some expect.  Investors should proceed with caution.
