{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.
1. **Asset Management:** This segment generates management fees and carried interest primarily from capital raised by private equity, credit, and real estate funds. As of the most recently reported quarter, Apollo had raised almost $600 billion across 90+ distinct funds. 
    * **Revenue Drivers:** Management and advisory fees, transaction fees, and carried interest earned on fund investments.
    * **Trends:** The industry is increasingly competitive, with a growing number of alternative asset managers entering the space, along with increased regulatory scrutiny.

2. **Retirement Services:** Retirement Services segment generates revenues primarily through Athene Holding Ltd.'s business, which it controls. Athene is a retirement services provider that issues, reinsures, and acquires retirement savings products including fixed annuities and funding agreements.
    * **Revenue Drivers:** Athene generates revenue through policy fees and premiums in addition to net investment income.
    * **Trends:** Increased regulatory scrutiny in response to the global financial crisis.

3. **Principal Investing:** This segment manages the deployment of Apollo’s own capital and invests in various businesses. It also generates earnings from providing capital to the other two segments.
    * **Revenue Drivers:** Income generated from equity stakes in various investments and companies as well as providing capital to the other two segments.
    * **Trends:** The segment currently maintains about $35 Billion in invested capital (as of the most recently reported quarter) across three main buckets: Insurance (50%), Other (25%), and Principal Lending and Real Estate.

**Industry Overview:**

The alternative asset management industry has experienced significant growth over the past few decades, driven by investor demand for higher returns and diversification. However, the industry is also becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants and existing firms expanding their offerings.  Regulatory scrutiny of the financial sector, in general, and alternative asset managers, in particular, has increased substantially since the 2008 financial crisis.

**Margins:**

Asset management exhibits substantial operating margins that exceeded 40 percent in the most recently reported quarter. The margins on retirement services are narrower.  Profitability of principal investments is highly variable. Overall, as the firm moves from managing for management fees to carrying interest, margins are expected to increase over time, especially if funds are successful.


**Moat Evaluation:**

Apollo's moat is narrow, earning a rating of **2 out of 5**.

* **Intangible Assets (Brands):** Apollo has built a strong brand name and reputation in the alternative investment management industry. This brand recognition can attract investors, but brand value is fleeting. The financial crisis in 2007 revealed that brand names do not always provide protection.
* **Switching Costs:**  High switching costs are associated with changing asset managers – especially for institutional clients. Switching funds can be expensive, disruptive, and incur tax consequences. This generates some client stickiness for Apollo. However, institutional investors are rational and are more likely to switch if there is a compelling reason (underperformance) to do so. 
* **Network Effect:** The network effect is not a significant source of moat for Apollo.
* **Cost Advantage:** Apollo does not have a significant cost advantage. In fact, there is increasing evidence that higher fund fees and high profile expenses reduce long term fund profitability.

**Valuation:**

Given the difficulty in valuing alternative investment managers and financial institutions, and assuming Apollo will eventually revert toward being an operating company, I favor a valuation using discounted cash flow (DCF) on cash flows.

**Assumptions and Calculations (Most Recent Fiscal Year End):**

<details>

* **Growth:** Revenue growth has been relatively stable over the past 5 years averaging 5% annually. Given increasing competition in the space and the macro headwinds for the alternative asset management sector, I assume revenue growth of 2% per year for the next 10 years, followed by a terminal growth rate of 1% thereafter.
* **Margins:** Given increasing competition and fee compression for management fees, operating margin is forecast to decrease gradually from the latest level of 44.4% to 35%.
* **Reinvestment:** Using the revenue growth and return on new invested capital (RONIC) assumption (see next point) and the equation for the reinvestment rate laid out in *Valuation*, we arrive at a reinvestment rate of 10%.
* **Return on New Invested Capital (RONIC):** Historical RONIC has been very high. However, given the significant amount of capital deployed in private equity, credit, real estate, and equity investments, I believe these returns are likely to converge towards the current cost of capital in the long run. Hence, I will assume RONIC is equal to WACC.
* **Cost of Capital:** In line with *Valuation*, I have employed the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). I am using a risk-free rate of 4% (10-year U.S. Treasury yield). Since Apollo operates in multiple businesses with different operating and financing mixes, I have chosen the MSCI All Country World Index as the relevant market index, generating a market risk premium of 4.5%. Using industry betas, an unlevered beta of 0.8 for investments and asset management businesses. Beta is then adjusted using the methodology in Appendix D for levering/unlevering, given the capital structure of Apollo. The average rate on debt is assumed to be 5.2%, the market rate on investment grade bonds. Finally, the marginal tax rate is assumed to be 25%. This results in a weighted average cost of capital of 7.6%.
* **Probability of Failure:** 1%. 
* **Distress Sale Value:** The distress sale value is assumed to be equal to the present value of the debt (this is a worst-case liquidation scenario), since the financial assets and financial liabilities and equities would cancel out during a fire sale.
* **Terminal value:** calculated using a perpetual growth perpetuity

**Cash flow computation**
FCF = Net Income * (1 – Reinvestment rate)
FCF = Net Income (1-0.1)

**Valuation**
The present value of cash flow to the firm during the explicit forecast period is calculated using the formula described in Chapter 6 of *Valuation*.
Then sum up present values of explicit forecast period cash flows with the present value of the terminal cash flows to determine the value of operating assets.
Value of Operating Assets = $29,507 million.

Value of the firm = Value of operating assets + cash = $29,507 + $4,112 = $33,619 million.
Value of equity = Value of the firm – Debt = $33,619 – $1,801 = $31,818 million.

Value per share = $31,818 million / 221 million shares = $144/share

Using the median price-to-earnings ratio for the industry yields a value in the vicinity of $60-$65/share.

**Justification for Moat Rating:**

While Apollo benefits from switching costs and brand recognition, the increasingly competitive landscape and limited differentiation among alternative asset managers suggest that the firm's moat is narrow.  Moreover, the increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies and fee compression on management fees suggests that future profitability may be lower than current levels.

**Key Risks:**

* **Competition:** Intense competition from other alternative asset managers, potentially leading to lower fees and reduced profitability.
* **Market Volatility:**  Significant swings in market values can negatively affect investment returns and carried interest earnings.
* **Regulatory Changes:** Increased regulatory scrutiny of the financial sector could result in new rules and restrictions that limit Apollo's flexibility and profitability.
* **Key Person Risk:** While the business now relies on the platform rather than a single individual, dependence upon individual portfolio managers for generating alpha (excess return above their benchmark) can create exposure to key man risk.

**Conclusion:**

Apollo's narrow moat and the estimated fair value of $144/share, which is slightly below the current trading price (at the time of writing) suggests that the stock is fully priced, even potentially overvalued.
