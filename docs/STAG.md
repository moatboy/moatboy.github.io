### Business Overview
{: .highlight }
STAG Industrial is a REIT that acquires and operates single-tenant industrial properties, with a primary focus on light manufacturing and warehouse/distribution facilities. They lease these properties to a diverse range of tenants, which reduces risk as the Company isn't reliant on any single industry.

*   **Revenue Distribution:**
    *   The majority of STAG's revenue comes from rental income, with a small portion from service, tenant recoveries, and property management revenue. They operate as an “open-air” industrial REIT, leasing out facilities for rent and collecting fees for upkeep.
    *   As of September 30, 2022, The Company's 30 Target Markets are 18.3% of total annualized base rent, and the Top 20 largest industries (e.g., Automotive, Air Transport, etc.) amount to 83.3% of annualized base rent.
*   **Industry Trends:**
    *   The industrial real estate market is currently benefiting from e-commerce growth, increased supply chain reshoring, and rising demand for logistics space. This demand has resulted in generally higher rental rates and occupancy rates.
    *   However, rising interest rates and inflation pose some headwinds, increasing capital costs and potentially impacting tenant profitability which may affect the company’s revenue growth.
    *   The industrial real estate market is highly fragmented. This implies that a single major downturn in the industry can have a material impact. However, at the same time, market downturns are less likely to influence the entire industrial real estate landscape as there are so many different factors at play.
    *    There is an increasing demand for "last mile" warehouses which are located closer to end-consumers to meet the needs of fast delivery for e-commerce customers.

*   **Margins:**
    *   STAG’s operating margins typically hover around 60%, and net margins are significantly lower because of depreciation and other related financial charges.
    *   However, the company has a well-established track record of maintaining a high margin level.
    *   Margins have dipped recently because of higher interest expenses and general operating expenses.
*  **Competitive Landscape:**
    *    The industrial REIT market is highly fragmented, with numerous large and small players.
    *     In the long-term, most companies are fairly similar to each other, but for a single year, there may be differences in revenue growth, profitability and ROIC.
    *    Since the company focuses on single-tenant industrial real estate, its competitors include other REITs that own similar properties, and large, private investment firms.
    *   The competitive environment also depends on geographic regions and other differences and nuances of local economies. This includes local taxes, regulations, and other region-specific policies.
*   **What makes the company different?**
  *   STAG focuses on single-tenant industrial properties, not other kinds of real estate like office or residential. Also, it has a relatively wide geographic diversification, unlike many other REITs.
{: .important }
STAG tries to be very granular in its investment strategy and to invest in areas where the competitive threat isn’t very high.

### Financial Analysis

*   **Reorganized Income Statement:**
    *   For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, STAG Industrial reported a revenue of $550.5 million.  This is up from $478.2 million during the same period in 2021.
    *   Operating expenses also saw a corresponding increase, rising to $240.7 million in 2022 from $209.3 million in 2021, driven primarily by higher property operating expenses.
    *    Operating profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, came in at $309.8 million compared to $268.9 million in the same period the prior year.
     *   The net income attributable to common stockholders was $105.1 million, a decrease compared to the $157.4 million in 2021.
     *   The FFO for the same period is $1.79, an increase compared to the $1.67 the previous year.
    *  In the latest quarter (Q3 2022), the company reported a very healthy occupancy of 98%, but a slight drop in blended rent growth by 2.6% to 23.9%. They also mentioned that a slowdown in the leasing pace may be a sign of caution because of possible macro headwinds, like a recession.
*   **Balance Sheet**
    *   The company has been growing its operations quite rapidly through acquisitions, which has led to an increase in debt levels.
    *   On September 30, 2022, their total assets stood at $7.8 billion, while their total liabilities were $3.9 billion. However, the company also has $831 million in cash, suggesting they are well-funded.
    *   As of September 30, 2022, the company had $1.6 billion in net debt, and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.5
    *    The company is consistently expanding its cash position, and is well-funded from this end.
{: .important }
While the company has quite a lot of debt, their assets are more than enough to keep the financial structure stable.
*   **Cash Flow**
    *   For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash from operations totaled $325 million.
    *   The company has shown strong and relatively consistent cash flows over time, which have been largely allocated to capex, acquisitions and paying down debt.
*   **Recent Concerns / Controversies and Problems**
    *    The recent slowdown in occupancy growth and the drop in rent growth are areas of caution in the company's performance.
    *   There have also been a few acquisitions that the company had to drop, due to the potential impact on the companies profitability.
     *  High interest rates will mean that the company will need to adjust its capital structure.
    *  The management is aware of the risks, and has reiterated that they are focused on long-term sustainability.
    *   The management is focused on acquiring high-quality tenants that can withstand economic downturns.

### Moat Assessment

*   **Sources of Moat:**
  *  STAG's main source of moat stems from its location-based advantages, which allow for cheaper transportation costs, a benefit especially for commodity-based tenants. Also, these local advantages help the company form regional mini-monopolies that are often very difficult to replicate, making them valuable.
    *   The company also benefits from switching costs for its tenants; since the company operates as a single-tenant operator, all the tenants have made their own changes and modifications to the properties. The costs of moving and reinstalling are very high, and this makes clients sticky. 
*  **Moat Rating:** 2/5
    *   STAG does have a moat, but it's narrow. While the company has a lot of benefits from its location and switching cost based moats, the company faces a lot of risk from the macroeconomic forces of industry, and can be easily displaced by new market conditions.
    *   They also don’t seem to be a leader in any of their target markets, nor do they have proprietary technology that gives them a competitive edge. They are also highly susceptible to local recessions.

### Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience

*   **Industry-Wide Factors:** Rising interest rates can increase borrowing costs. The growth of e-commerce can also slow down, which will reduce demand for warehouses and logistic space.
*   **Economic Factors:** Economic downturns and local recessions can lead to a decline in occupancy rates or defaults from the company’s clients.
*   **Company-Specific Factors:**
 * Any problems with the company's financial structure, especially a sudden increase in interest expenses, could put pressure on liquidity and profitability.
  * A sudden downturn or slowdown in new investment, or an increase in bad debt by the company's customers.
*  **Business Resilience:**
    *   STAG’s current performance is good and has the potential to grow further. But it also has a few weaknesses, like overreliance on debt to fund growth and susceptibility to negative economic changes.
    *   While a large-scale recession may affect the company's earnings somewhat, the diversification in clients means that it is likely to have less risk than other, less diverse, real estate companies.
    *    The management is also trying to focus on long-term tenants, which would help give some stability to their revenue.

### Understandability Rating

*  **Rating:** 2 / 5
    *  The company’s overall business is fairly easy to understand: they lease warehouses and other industrial spaces to tenants for a profit. But the nuances behind a REIT are often confusing, especially for newcomers, and the accounting can also get difficult.
    *  Also, while they are not a complex business, it also requires a detailed understanding of the micro-economics of its many locations, which can take some time to understand. The complex interactions between real estate, leases, and debt can make it complicated for newcomers.

### Balance Sheet Health Rating
*  **Rating:** 4/5
    * The company has a decent balance sheet. While their debt is high, it is still manageable and their assets provide enough back-up.
    *  They also have a good cash position that is being used wisely, and their capital position is very stable.
    * However, the high debt level will make the business vulnerable to interest rate changes, which the management is working to fix.

### Conclusion
STAG Industrial is a company that can continue to do well and generate a good profit. However, it is subject to a few risks related to economic and industry wide headwinds, which means that their moat is a bit narrow. The company also does a good job at generating cash and maintaining their financial strength, which makes it reasonably healthy and safe for investors.
