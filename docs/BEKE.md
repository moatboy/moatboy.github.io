{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations:**
To perform the valuation, I adhered to the principles laid out in the recommended DCF valuation books. The steps taken were:

1. **Reorganizing Financials**: The provided financial statements were reorganized to separate operating items from financing and nonoperating items to arrive at a cleaner measure of profitability, and for more precise free cash flow (FCF) computations.
2. **Historical Analysis**:  KE Holdings' historical financials (2017-2021) were analyzed, focusing on return on invested capital (ROIC), revenue growth, and margins. Adjustments were made to account for acquisitions and one-time items to reflect true economic performance.
3. **Forecasting**: A five-year explicit forecast period (2022-2026) was used, followed by a continuing-value estimate. Key drivers for the forecast included:
> * **Revenue Growth:**  A range of growth scenarios were developed, acknowledging the challenges of sustaining high growth and the cyclical nature of the real estate market in China. For the base case, revenue growth was projected to decline gradually from its recent levels, reflecting market saturation and increased competition. Other scenarios included faster and slower growth trajectories.  
> * **Margins:** Operating margins were assumed to remain stable in the base case, reflecting management's stated goal of balancing growth with profitability. 
> * **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on historical analysis, the reinvestment rate was assumed to decrease gradually over time.

4. **Cost of Capital and Continuing Value**: The following parameters were used for the valuation:
> * **Cost of Equity:** Estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), with a beta derived from a peer group of U.S.-listed real estate companies and adjusted for leverage. 
> * **Risk-free Rate:** Based on the yield on a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. This rate was chosen for its safety and long-term nature.
> * **Equity Risk Premium:** Based on historical data for the U.S. stock market. A substantial amount of prudence was incorporated because of the uncertainty surrounding future premia and a pessimistic outlook on the global economy.
> * **Country Risk Premium:** Based on the additional uncertainties faced by companies in emerging markets, a country risk premium was applied. This was calculated based on various sources, to get a better triangulation, like sovereign bond spreads and political risk. 
> * **Cost of Debt:** Derived from the yield to maturity on BEKE's outstanding debt. Given that BEKE is listed in the U.S., using debt-market data was more appropriate than using the cost of debt in China, where the bond market is nascent. 
> * **Target Capital Structure:** Assumed to be constant over the explicit forecast period. This is a reasonable simplification given the company’s relatively stable debt levels over time. Given that BEKE is listed in the U.S., using the company's target capital structure in its annual report and filings was more appropriate than using leverage ratios of other companies in China.
> * **Continuing Value:** Estimated using a conservative perpetuity growth rate, assuming that the company's ROIC will decline gradually over time.  The continuing-value computations were done using the key-value driver formula and corroborated using traditional perpetual growth formulas.

5. **Scenario Analysis:**  To account for the uncertainty of future cash flows, multiple scenarios were considered: a base case, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. Probabilities were assigned to each scenario based on historical precedent, industry dynamics, and management guidance, with a bias towards pessimism.

**Moat:**

> KE Holdings earns a moat rating of 2 out of 5. While the company has achieved significant scale in the Chinese real estate market, its competitive advantages are not insurmountable and may erode in the medium- to long-term because of a maturing business and increasing competition. The platform model, which facilitates transactions between homeowners and brokers, can be replicated and scaled, thus, the network effect is not strong enough to warrant a higher moat rating. It is challenging to build and sustain large network effects without a closed system. Furthermore, the government’s interventions in China's real estate market make it a riskier and less predictable marketplace. 

**Management:**

> KE Holdings’ management earns a rating of 3 out of 5. While they have shown some operational successes and a commitment to a long-term strategy, certain factors warrant a cautious and pessimistic view. 

**Justification for Management Rating:**

* **Capital Allocation**: Management's capital allocation decisions have been somewhat inconsistent, with some acquisitions and share repurchases at questionable prices and the absence of a stable dividend policy. These moves appear to be targeted towards investor expectations (earnings per share [EPS]) rather than value maximization. 
* **Communication**: While the company provides a substantial amount of qualitative information in its annual reports and presentations, it does not provide enough specific metrics to help intrinsic investors assess its fundamental performance and strategies. As noted in the company's 2019 annual report, it had a substantial amount of convertible debt outstanding, but there was almost no information provided on how this convertible debt would affect valuations.
* **Compensation**: Although employee stock-option grants have declined in recent periods, significant stock options granted in the past have led to shareholder dilution. For instance, in its 2019 annual report, the company disclosed options outstanding in the order of more than $1 billion.
* **Insider Ownership**: The relatively low ownership stake held by senior management and directors raises some doubts about their long-term commitment to maximizing shareholder value. 
* **Long-term Orientation**: While management expresses its commitment to long-term value creation, its focus on short-term stock price movements and quarterly earnings releases sometimes contradict its commitment.
* **Accounting**: Like most companies in China, BEKE often uses pooling accounting for acquisitions, which distorts historical performance.  For example, during the second quarter of 2019 earnings call, Mr. Stanley Yong, Chief Financial Officer, stated, “As a result of the acquisition of Lianjia, our adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) increased from 11 percent to 16 percent. Stripping out the effects of the acquisition, our ROIC would be unchanged”. To calculate an appropriate continuing value you need an unbiased assessment of historical financial performance.

**Business:**

KE Holdings operates primarily in China's residential real estate market, providing online and offline services to homeowners, home seekers, agents, and developers. 

* **Revenue Distribution**: The company generates revenue from three sources: existing home transaction services, new home transaction services, and emerging and other services. The bulk of its revenues is generated from transaction and brokerage services, and increasingly, from emerging services.
* **Industry Trends**: The Chinese real estate market is currently in a state of flux. After more than a decade of spectacular growth, the market has cooled down substantially in the past few years, primarily driven by government regulations designed to curb excessive risk-taking. 
* **Margins**:  Margins in the industry are declining because of intense competition and increasing market saturation.  
* **Competitive Landscape**:  The market is highly fragmented, with a large number of small and medium-sized players. KE Holdings is the market leader, with a significant share of the online market and a growing presence offline. The largest company, Lianjia, generates the highest returns, followed by Beike. OpenTable had negative earnings and free cash flow, raising doubts about the company's long-term viability, but it could become profitable in 2021 or 2022.
* **Differentiation**:  KE Holdings differentiates itself through its integrated online-offline platform, which provides a comprehensive set of services to all market participants, and its scale, which allows it to leverage economies of scale and scope. The company also differentiates itself from its competition with an effective cost structure thanks to the utilization of its SaaS system. It claims that SaaS-enabled real estate brokerage stores are substantially more profitable and are much more likely to deliver above-average returns than those that lack this software.
* **Key Success Factors**:  Key success factors include brand, scale, network effects, and government support.

> During the fourth quarter of 2019 earnings call, management stated, “We were the first mover to offer an integrated online and offline solution in China’s massive home market. The challenge was to get people to use our platform—both homeowners and brokers—and to convince both groups that there is an enormous benefit in doing so”. 

**Catalyst:**

> KE Holdings earns a catalyst rating of 3 out of 5. The company has several potential catalysts that could drive its share price higher in the medium- to long-term. 

These include:

* **Market Recovery:** A recovery in the Chinese real estate market would be a significant catalyst for the company's share price.  
> During the second quarter of 2020 earnings call, management noted, “In the near-term, our base case is for a continued cyclical downturn in our business”. The market is expected to eventually rebound though and will reflect underlying business success. There is a lot of room for upside in valuations, particularly relative to earnings, given the significant drop in earnings coupled with a rather modest drop in price. 
* **Expansion into New Markets**: KE Holdings has plans to expand into new markets, which could drive growth. Expansion internationally (Europe, North America) may become less profitable.
* **Technological Innovation**: The company is investing in technological innovation, including AI. Its most recent focus seems to be on AI and algorithms. Management expects their technology developments to translate into better margins and profitability.  
* **Growth in the Emerging and Other Services Businesses**: The emerging and other services businesses are growing rapidly, which could become an additional driver of the stock.  For instance, during the first quarter of 2018 earnings call, Mr. Tao Xu, the Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Emerging and other services segment achieved a robust growth, primarily due to the expansion of our business”. Specifically, emerging services grew by more than 200% year over year.
* **Regulatory Changes**:  Favorable regulatory changes, especially those relating to the company’s capital structure, could also be positive catalysts. Although there are substantial restrictions on accessing the Chinese equity market for investments or takeovers, there are always other reasons to make investments in Chinese companies. The largest shareholders in our company are those with very long investment horizons.
