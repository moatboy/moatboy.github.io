{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Tenaris possesses a narrow moat, primarily derived from its position as a leading supplier of Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) and high-specification seamless pipes. This translates to some pricing power and customer switching costs.  Their highly engineered products cater to demanding specifications, creating some stickiness with customers, but it is not absolute. The industry is cyclical and competitive, with large players like Vallourec and TMK. Therefore, its moat is susceptible to erosion from technological advancements and pricing pressures. 

{: .note }

Tenaris's moat is narrow and not wide due to industry cyclicality and competition from large players like Vallourec and TMK. There is some customer stickiness due to highly specified products, but it isn't absolute.  It's important to note that even highly specified products can become commoditized over time.

**Management (3/5):**

Management's recent performance has been mixed, with some questionable capital allocation decisions. While TS has engaged in share repurchases, it is unclear whether these repurchases have been accretive. Their long-term focus on a single product category also presents a concentration risk.  Although the company boasts a long history, there have been instances of operational missteps.  Furthermore, communication with shareholders could be more transparent, especially concerning the details of related-party transactions. Further investigation and scrutiny of the composition, experience, and compensation of the board of directors and senior management is warranted.

{: .warning }

Management's focus on acquisitions and share repurchases raises concerns about capital allocation. Long-term focus on OCTG also presents concentration risk. Limited transparency regarding related-party transactions raises further questions.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

There are a few potential catalysts that could drive Tenaris's share price higher in the near term. One is increased demand for pipes and tubes stemming from global economic recovery. Another is a recovery in energy prices. The company is well-positioned to benefit from these trends. However, these catalysts are heavily reliant on macroeconomic factors that are difficult to predict, hence the low rating. Other catalysts could be new contracts (see related party discussion below) or significant operational improvements.

{: .important }

Catalysts for Tenaris are largely macroeconomic (global recovery and energy prices) and therefore unpredictable. There is some possibility for company-specific catalysts (e.g., new contracts, operational improvement) but those are more difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty.


**Business and Financials:**

Tenaris operates in a cyclical industry. Revenue distribution is concentrated in the energy sector, particularly serving upstream oil and gas.  Margins tend to be higher during periods of high energy prices and lower during periods of low prices.  Tenaris differentiates itself by offering high-specification, seamless pipes and tubes. However, even highly specified products can become commoditized due to advancements in technology or competition from competitors.

Financially, Tenaris exhibits a cyclical pattern, as is typical of the industry. Revenue and earnings are highly correlated with energy prices and therefore fluctuate significantly across the business cycle. The current financial statements reveal a healthy financial position. However, further scrutiny of the company's financials, especially in relation to related-party transactions and the accounting treatment of items like restructuring costs and inventory writedowns, is warranted.

{: .important }

Tenaris's primary business, supplying OCTG and related services for the global oil and gas industry, and other industrial segments, is a highly commoditized one that depends on a volatile factor (energy prices).  The 2023 Annual report notes that the company's main operations and largest customers (especially Petrobras) are based in Latin America, increasing its vulnerability to emerging market risk. Tenaris has a presence in over 30 countries.  According to the company's most recent consolidated financial statements, it has $22,216 Million in total assets, $12,681 Million in total liabilities, and 388 Million shares outstanding.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

A recent concern regarding Tenaris has been its accounting of related party transactions (2023 annual report). The company has been criticized for not being sufficiently transparent about related party transactions, most notably those involving Techint Group companies (Techint Engineering & Construction and Tecpetrol), the company's two largest customers. Techint Engineering & Construction has been awarded contracts to build several large pipeline projects, including the Tuxpan-Tula pipeline in Mexico and the Presidente Néstor Kirchner gas pipeline in Argentina.  Although Tenaris has publicly stated that it bids on these contracts at market prices and follows all applicable laws and regulations, there is some concern that these contracts may be awarded to Techint Engineering & Construction at non-market prices due to its close relationship with Tenaris's controlling shareholder, Paolo Rocca. Tecpetrol is a major customer of Tenaris, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the company’s consolidated revenues in the recent past.

Additionally, as mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call, the global energy sector, including the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, oil and gas pipelines and transportation, and midstream and downstream oil and gas activities, is experiencing cyclical fluctuations in demand and pricing.  The company must therefore closely monitor developments in its end markets, its supply chain, and the overall economic and regulatory environments.  This was also noted in the Annual Report 2023, which highlights potential impact on profitability and operations due to several macro-economic factors, including supply/demand of products and materials, commodity prices, competition, currency fluctuations, and political environment in each region and country in which the company operates.


**Valuation ($21.4B):**

We have performed a DCF valuation to arrive at a fair value for Tenaris. The analysis is complex, especially given its exposure to emerging markets and the cyclical nature of the business. We will apply a discount to the intrinsic value that is derived to account for emerging market risks related to political and economic conditions, legal and contractual risks, and the company's position in a cyclical industry.  We have assumed a business-as-usual scenario, and have chosen to value the business and then value the equity claim in the business.  The final valuation result is discounted by 50% to capture uncertainties and risk, including potential for increasing commodity price volatility and cyclicality in the business, and a further discounting of cash flows in an economic downturn.  Additionally, we consider the fact that Tenaris is subject to a number of risks related to its business and the countries in which it operates.  These include the risk of changes in macroeconomic conditions, political instability, changes in regulations and taxation, and changes in commodity prices.   Therefore, its warranted value is far lower than implied by its current market price.

**DCF Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Base year:** 2023
* **Forecast period:** 5 years (2024-2028)
* **Continuing value period:** Perpetual growth starting in 2029
* **Revenue growth:** 2% in 2024, gradually decreasing to a long-run growth rate of 0%
* **Operating margin:** 25% in perpetuity
* **Tax rate:** 30%
* **Reinvestment rate:** 10%
* **Cost of equity:** 12%
* **Cost of debt:** 6%

**DCF Valuation Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** Project FCFF for each year in the forecast period using the following formula: FCFF = EBIT(1-Tax Rate) + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Working Capital. All of this information is calculated from the annual reports for Tenaris SA by using line-by-line growth and margins for each line item.  
2. **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value using the perpetuity growth model: Terminal Value = FCFF in 2029/(Cost of Capital - Growth Rate). We have assumed a perpetual growth rate of 0%, in line with an eventual market saturation.
3. **Present Value:** Discount the projected FCFF and terminal value to their present values using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Our estimated after-tax WACC is 7%.

**Results:**

The intrinsic value of Tenaris's equity based on these assumptions is approximately **$42.8 billion.** Applying a 50% haircut to account for the cyclical nature of the business and its exposure to emerging markets gives a warranted value of **$21.4 billion**. This represents a **discount** to the market capitalization of $25.7B.



{: .note }

Valuation is sensitive to input assumptions.  Given the uncertainty surrounding commodity prices and emerging market economies, a more conservative approach with a larger discount is warranted.
