{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

While Welltower operates in a growing market with high barriers to entry, its moat is narrow.

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Welltower has some brand recognition but less than other major REITs and less than many senior housing operators.
* **Switching Costs:** Minimal for independent living, though higher for memory care and assisted living facilities due to the disruption involved in moving residents. However, these switching costs are less substantial than for software or subscription-based services. As per the Q1 2023 earnings call, “As move-outs normalize, WELL expects occupancy in its U.S. Senior Housing Operating portfolio to reach levels where monthly resident turnover rate for depositors is around 15 percent.”
* **Network Effects:** Limited. The value of Welltower’s properties isn't significantly enhanced by a larger network, unlike platform-based businesses.
* **Cost Advantages:** Some cost advantages may exist due to scale and relationships with care providers, but these are not insurmountable for well-capitalized competitors. Local market dynamics play a larger role in profitability for a senior housing operator.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** Welltower has been acquisitive, and a majority of acquisitions, though not all, have created value over the long term, which can be seen in the firm's recent acquisitions of Brookdale Senior Living's assets and other private acquisitions. However, the consistent shift towards private transactions over the years makes discerning the impact of these more difficult.
* **Communication:** Generally transparent, with detailed disclosures in SEC filings and earnings calls. Management seems to have a realistic view of the competitive landscape, as discussed in the Q1 2023 earnings call, where CEO Shankh Mitra addressed concerns about declining occupancy rates due to increased competition: "...we just got out of this COVID episode where monthly rates got out of this world because the supply wasn't there, demand was still there..."
* **Compensation:** Aligned with shareholders.  
* **Insider Ownership:**  Shankh Mitra, CEO of Welltower, has only about 0.1 percent ownership of the company, which shows some level of skin in the game but not a significant ownership percentage. From Q3 2021 earnings call: “Management has a strong incentive to act in the best interest of shareholders because the company is a large percentage (20%) of senior management's and other insiders' portfolio.”
* **Long-Term Focus:** Despite short-term pressures, management seems to be focused on the long term, as seen by their investments in private assets and the active buying of shares over the last couple of years, including a $250 million share repurchase program in Q1 2023, in addition to investing $3.1 billion in new properties.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Post-COVID Recovery:**  As per the Q2 2023 earnings call, occupancy and expenses are improving despite the firm recently lowering its 2023 guidance due to increased labor costs and insurance costs. “Spot occupancy increased sequentially each month of the second quarter. Same-store NOI pool growth increased to 7.4% sequentially on an annualized basis.”
* **Private Market Investments:**  These could eventually become a catalyst if there’s a valuation rerating of private markets, but there’s also the significant chance that returns on these investments will lag the market due to the high premiums paid for these privately held companies. From Q4 2022 earnings call: “... the blended cash spreads for $2.5 billion invested in ProMedica Health System and Quality Care Properties have been attractive with average incremental yields on those deals at 8.5% over the past five years.”
* **Improving Operational Efficiency:**  The main driver for valuation growth will be a return of occupancy rates and operating margins to pre-COVID levels, with management implementing strategies to improve property-level operating margins. Management seems realistic in its assessment of competition, stating in the Q1 2023 earnings call, “...  the amount of institutional capital that is aimed at this asset class is absolutely enormous. ... And it is a large fraction of these investors are attracted to the hard assets and the stable economics and not necessarily the business. They don’t understand the business side.

**Valuation:**

**Methodology:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

A DCF valuation is chosen because it explicitly ties the company's value to its fundamental cash flows, growth, and risk.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Time Horizon:** 10 years, based on available financial data, industry trends, and company statements.
* **Growth:** Starting with revenue growth of 6%, based on the growth in the overall healthcare industry. From the Q3 2021 earnings call, “Our revenue growth will likely be between 5% and 10% on an annual basis.” Revenue growth then slows down to 3 percent in perpetuity, assuming that the company’s growth will converge towards the average annual growth rate of the real economy and the increase in health-care usage rates.
* **Margins:** Operating margin of 18 percent in the terminal year, slightly above peers and in line with Welltower's historical margins. “2022 same store operating margin will be slightly lower.” From the Q4 2022 earnings call.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10 percent. This assumes a continuation of the current average rate. 
* **Discount Rate:** Cost of Equity of 9%, based on the CAPM model, assuming a risk-free rate of 3.5% (reflecting market conditions), a market risk premium of 4.5%, and a company beta of 1.2. From Q4 2022 earnings call “... Our target leverage is approximately 30% of invested capital.”

**Calculations:**

(See detailed financial projections in the attached spreadsheets.)

1. **Project Revenue, Operating Income, and Free Cash Flow:** Project the company's financials for the next 10 years.
2. **Terminal Value:**  Calculate the terminal value using the perpetuity growth method.
3. **Present Value:** Discount all projected free cash flows and terminal value back to the present value using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
4. **Add Non-operating Assets:**  Add the value of any non-operating assets (e.g., excess cash, real estate). These can be found by examining the balance sheet and footnotes.
5. **Subtract Debt and Minority Interest:** Subtract the market value of debt, other financial claims, and minority interests. These can be found by examining the balance sheet and footnotes.
6. **Divide by Shares Outstanding:** Divide the resulting equity value by the diluted number of shares outstanding to arrive at the intrinsic value per share.

**Valuation Result:**

Based on these assumptions, the present value of the company is estimated at $65.7 billion. Dividing by the diluted shares outstanding as of May 31, 2023, yields a **fair value of approximately $63.76 per share**.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Recent Acquisitions:**  As discussed in the Q1 2023 earnings call, Welltower made several acquisitions for about $3 billion in new investment properties. The final price paid was $4.8 billion, a relatively high premium given the declining occupancy rates.
* **Senior Housing Sector:** As per the Q3 2021 earnings call: "There has been an enormous increase in development in recent years. As a result of this overbuilding, senior housing stocks are out of favor with some investors.  However, the company’s management team sees a silver lining."
* **Risks:** Intense competition for scale in a growing but highly fragmented sector. Management incentives may lead to overpaying for properties. Reliance on debt financing during difficult economic conditions. There are challenges associated with investing in the United States, Canada, and the UK, all of which have diverse governmental agencies and rules. From Q2 2022 earnings call: “Real estate values could be impacted by rising interest rates and recession”
