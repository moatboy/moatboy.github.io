Moat: 2/5

Pessimistic value: $18.8 B

Spotify is a music streaming service with a dual revenue model: premium subscriptions (no ads) and an ad-supported service. It currently operates in most of the world, but its core markets (North America and Europe) are becoming increasingly saturated, presenting challenges for continued growth. While Spotify is the industry leader, competition remains intense, especially with Apple Music and Amazon Music vying for market share.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** Spotify's revenues are generated from two primary sources: premium subscriptions and advertising. Premium revenue accounts for the vast majority of revenue, though ad revenue is growing faster but from a smaller base. Key recent revenue trends include:
    * Overall revenue growth of approximately 10% in recent years, exceeding $11 billion in 2022.
    * Premium revenue accounts for roughly 90% of revenue, although its growth is slowing. Premium ARPU is also gradually decreasing.
    * Ad-supported MAU growth has been faster than Premium subscriptions, although it produces much less revenue per user.
    * Recent efforts to diversify revenue beyond music and podcasts, including audiobooks.
* **Industry:** The music streaming industry is a mature and consolidated industry, dominated by Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music. This presents significant challenges to increasing profits and maintaining market share.
* **Margins:** Gross profit margins are relatively low in the mid-20s and declining as the industry matures. Operating losses are significant due to investments in R&D, marketing, and expansion. Profit margins are expected to remain flat or decline in the future due to increased competition.
* **Capital expenditures:** Spotify invests heavily in product development and global expansion. Given its relatively low profitability, this has resulted in high capital expenditures, typically exceeding $1 billion annually.

**Moat Analysis**

Spotify's narrow moat comes from network effects and switching costs, but there are substantial risks:

* **Network Effects:** Spotify benefits from network effects on the user side. Artists are incentivized to release music on the largest platform with the most listeners, and listeners are drawn to the platform with the most music. While the network effect provides a competitive advantage, it can be weakened by open ecosystems (Android and iOS) and multi-homing.
* **Switching Costs:** Users incur non-monetary switching costs due to their accumulated music libraries, playlists, personalized recommendations, and social network of musical contacts. These switching costs appear to be relatively low, however, making the moat narrow rather than wide.
* **Risks to Moat:**
    * **Competition:**  Apple and Amazon have the financial muscle and existing user bases to compete aggressively, potentially weakening Spotify's network effects and limiting its pricing power.
    * **Open Ecosystems:** The ease of switching between music apps on Android and iOS reduces Spotify's switching cost advantage.
    * **Regulation:**  The music industry has a long and complicated history with royalty payments, and shifts in regulations could significantly alter Spotify's economics.



**Valuation Assumptions (Pessimistic View)**

{: .highlight }

* **Revenue Growth:**  5% for the next 5 years.
* **Margins:** Flat operating margins in stable growth.
* **Return on Capital:** 12%.
* **Tax rate:** 25%
* **Cost of capital:** 10.25%
* **Perpetual Growth:** 3% (in nominal terms)

{: .important }

These assumptions reflect a pessimistic view of Spotify's future, with slowing growth and limited margin expansion due to intense competition.


**Valuation Calculation**

We use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Spotify. The details of the calculations are presented in the table below.
Note: Spotify has multiple share classes with different voting rights. For simplicity, we are ignoring these distinctions.

| Year | Projected Revenue ($M) | Operating Margin | EBIT ($M) | Reinvestment ($M) | Free Cash Flow ($M) | Discount Factor (10.25%) | Present Value of FCF ($M) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $12,548 | -1.89% | -$237 | -$100 | -$137 | 0.907 | -$124 |
| 2 | $13,175 | -1.89% | -$249 | -$105 | -$144 | 0.823 | -$118 |
| 3 | $13,834 | -1.89% | -$262 | -$111 | -$151 | 0.746 | -$113 |
| 4 | $14,525 | -1.89% | -$275 | -$117 | -$158 | 0.678 | -$107 |
| 5 | $15,252 | -1.89% | -$289 | -$123 | -$166 | 0.615 | -$102 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  |  |  | $13,850 |


**Terminal Value Calculation:**

* **Terminal value:** ($289 \* (1+0.03)) / (0.1025 - 0.03) = $4,231 million

**Total Value:**

* Value of operating assets: $13,448 Million (sum of present values of explicit forecast periods)
* Total Value: $13,448 + $4,231 (Terminal Value) = $17,679 million 


**Valuation Conclusion**
{: .warning }

Based on our pessimistic DCF valuation, Spotify's fair value is approximately **$18.8 Billion**. This is slightly higher than its current market capitalization, suggesting that the stock is potentially slightly overvalued, given our pessimistic assumptions.  It's important to note that the valuation is sensitive to changes in growth, margins, and the cost of capital. Small improvements in performance could significantly increase the valuation and vice versa. Any investment should be made at a sufficient margin of safety, given this sensitivity and the risks associated with Spotify's business.


**Additional Notes**

* This is a simplified valuation and ignores Spotify's dual share class structure.
* This valuation does not incorporate any potential upside from new ventures, such as audiobooks, which could be significant if successful. However, it also does not incorporate the potential downside from intensifying competition or any macroeconomic headwinds. 
* Given these valuation assumptions and Spotify's narrow moat rating, an investor would require a larger margin of safety before investing.

This analysis highlights the importance of considering not just the financials of a company but also its competitive position and the industry dynamics in which it operates.  Investors should avoid overpaying for growth and remain disciplined in their approach to valuation, especially in a competitive and mature industry like music streaming.
