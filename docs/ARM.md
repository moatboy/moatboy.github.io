{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

ARM's moat stems primarily from its dominant position in mobile CPUs, reinforced by network effects and high switching costs.  

* **Network Effects:** A larger ecosystem of software developers creating applications for ARM-based processors makes the platform more attractive for chip manufacturers, which in turn encourages additional software development, creating a virtuous cycle. This is analogous to the network effect in credit cards (the more merchants accept Amex, the more valuable it is to cardholders and vice versa, discussed in the book *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*).
* **Switching Costs:**  Shifting to a new architecture requires significant investment in redesign, testing, and software adaptation. Chip manufacturers are reluctant to abandon ARM given the established ecosystem and risk disruptions, as explained in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*.

However, competition from RISC-V, a free and open-source instruction set architecture (ISA), is a growing threat, potentially weakening ARM’s moat. Moreover, ARM's licensing model offers limited pricing power in a commodity-driven industry. Hence, the moat rating of 3/5, reflecting a narrow moat but with eroding potential.

**Management:**

Management rating is 3/5, reflecting a mixed assessment:

* **Positive:** ARM has a history of successful innovation and leadership in the mobile CPU market.  The management team appears competent in guiding the company through its growth cycle (from startup to IPO to growth company).
* **Negative:**  The heavy reliance on acquisitions for growth raises concerns.  While Softbank’s ownership did provide substantial capital, it also shielded ARM from market forces.  Further, the management's communication, especially with retail investors, has been limited.  Their capital allocation decisions and long-term strategy are still being evaluated by the market. Their compensation is not readily available, making it difficult to assess alignment with shareholders.

{: .warning }

There are no disclosures regarding management’s equity ownership in the publicly available documents. Further investigation is needed. 
  
**Business and Financials:**

* **Revenues:** ARM's revenues come primarily from licensing fees (upfront payments for IP usage) and royalties (payments based on chip sales).  The licensing business has higher margins but lower and lumpier revenues than the royalty business (discussed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*).  Growth in mobile chip sales, particularly in emerging markets, drives royalty revenue growth.
* **Margins:** Operating margins have generally been high and stable, reflecting the licensing-driven business model.  However, rising competition and investment needs might pressure margins in the future.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The competitive landscape is shifting. While ARM is dominant in mobile CPUs, x86 processors (Intel, AMD) dominate PCs and servers.  RISC-V, an open-source ISA, is posing a growing threat, particularly in price-sensitive markets, potentially squeezing future market share and margins. This competition is analogous to that faced by a generic drug firm when the patents of the branded drug expires (analyzed in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*).
* **Industry Trends:** The semiconductor industry is cyclical and marked by high R&D expenditures.  Technological advances lead to new product development, requiring ongoing investments to remain competitive, similar to the pharmaceutical industry. Growth in data centers, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) could offer new growth avenues. 

{: .note }

ARM's 2Q23 earnings call emphasized the importance of licensing revenues in the IoT and automotive sectors as growth drivers.
 
**Valuation:**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis (explained in detail in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*), I arrive at an approximate valuation of $67 billion for ARM.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 10% for the next 5 years, tapering down to 3% in perpetuity.  (Justification: Growth in emerging markets and new technologies, but tempered by competition and maturity of core business, as emphasized in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*.)
* **Operating Margin:** 35% in the long term. (Justification: Current high margins but acknowledging potential downward pressure, considering industry trends and competitive pressures, as explained in *Valuation*.)
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  50% in the high-growth phase, declining to 20% in perpetuity.  (Justification:  High reinvestment initially to capture growth, then declining with maturity, as explored in *Valuation*).
* **Cost of Capital:** 9%.  (Justification: Reflects the risk inherent in the semiconductor industry, particularly with growing competitive threats, as discussed in *The Intelligent Investor*. Beta of 1.2, risk-free rate of 4.5%, and equity risk premium of 4%, with current debt ratio factored into the cost of capital.)
* **Failure Rate:** 10% failure probability, assuming ARM could face significant challenges from competition and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.

No terminal goodwill was included in this valuation.
 
**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow Projections:** Project free cash flows for the next 10 years, based on revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment assumptions.
2. **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value using the perpetuity growth method (detailed in *Valuation*).
3. **Present Value:** Discount the projected free cash flows and terminal value at the cost of capital to arrive at the present value of operating assets.
4. **Failure Adjustment:** Adjust the present value of operating assets for the probability of failure and potential liquidation value.
5. **Cash, Debt, Options:**  Add back cash and other non-operating assets (estimated from recent balance sheet). Subtract debt and other non-equity claims (estimated from recent balance sheet). Value management stock options as a call option, as recommended in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, assuming their value is negligible for simplification.

The calculated present value of operating assets, after failure adjustment, is approximately $43 billion. Adding recent cash balances (assuming no significant change) of $10B and subtracting a conservative net debt of $0 gives an enterprise value of around $53B.


**Catalysts:**

Catalyst rating of 2/5:

* **Positive:** Growth in markets like IoT and AI and potential strategic partnerships or acquisitions could boost revenue and profitability. Successful integration of ARM’s Mali GPUs into data center and PC markets could significantly expand its market and therefore its revenues, leading to an increase in value.
* **Negative:**  The upcoming IPO creates uncertainty, and the pricing will be influenced by market sentiment, potentially resulting in either a substantial pop or a disappointing debut. Continued market share erosion to RISC-V could lessen the market’s assessment of ARM’s future profitability, resulting in a lower valuation.

{: .new }

ARM's CFO, Inder Singh, mentioned in the 2Q23 earnings call that they are looking for continued growth in China through collaboration with local companies.

**Concerns:**

* **Competition from RISC-V:**  The rapid growth of RISC-V, as discussed by analysts in recent earnings calls and emphasized in several investment articles, poses a serious challenge to ARM's dominance in the mobile chip market. Its open-source nature and lower cost could lead to market share erosion in the long run.
* **Post-IPO Performance:**  The initial performance of newly public companies can be very volatile.  While ARM is a well-known name, the stock could still experience significant price swings immediately following the IPO.
* **Softbank's Influence:** Softbank's involvement in setting IPO terms and its substantial ownership stake post-IPO raise questions about its influence on ARM's long-term strategy and capital allocation decisions.


This analysis reflects a cautious outlook for ARM.  While the company has a strong foundation, significant risks and competitive threats warrant a discounted valuation and a degree of skepticism. Given the inherent uncertainties and a pessimistic valuation approach, I conclude that a fair valuation for ARM is approximately $67 Billion.
