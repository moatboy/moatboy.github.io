>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

WEC operates in a regulated utility industry, creating a narrow moat.  A regulated business model in the utility industry provides some protection from competition, but there are still challenges.  These companies have near-monopolies in their service areas but face rate regulation. As the regulated utility is WEC's primary business, there is minimal opportunity to create a moat through new product innovation or technological edge.

>**From the "The Little Book That Builds Wealth":**  While regulated industries are attractive, it's important to examine the regulatory structure. Utility sectors can dig moats, but high returns can create issues with regulators.

WEC's operations are primarily in the Midwest, where population growth is significantly lower than in other parts of the U.S. This further limits growth potential and contributes to the narrow moat rating.  Additionally, WEC has shown a willingness to make acquisitions, as we'll see in the financials; however, acquisitions alone rarely create sustainable competitive advantages.

**Management (3/5):**

WEC's management team appears generally competent, but not exceptional. There are several points that contribute to this assessment:

* **History and Experience:** The company's executive team demonstrates a long history within the regulated utility sector, but lacks a clear track record of exceptional capital allocation or innovation.  Their primary focus has been on acquisitions and managing the existing utility business.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation seems reasonable and is not primarily tied to short-term metrics. This suggests a longer-term focus, which is positive, but it remains to be seen whether they can translate this into sustainable value creation for shareholders.
* **Insider Ownership:** Executive ownership stakes are minimal, and Board ownership is similarly modest. This doesn't necessarily indicate bad management, but neither does it provide a strong incentive for aligning with shareholder interests.
* **Communication:**  Management communication in earnings calls and company filings, although increasingly detailed, focuses on the standard utility metrics.  There is limited discussion of long-term value drivers or competitive strategy. The following quote from their Q3 2024 earnings call embodies a standard corporate narrative with a lack of specificity: "Our plan is to reduce methane emissions by improving our natural gas distribution system.  We target to reduce our GHG emissions to net-zero by 2050." While this signals a commitment to environmental goals, it offers minimal insight into the *how* and *why* that differentiates WEC from its competitors.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** WEC has made several acquisitions, including Integrys, for which they paid a significant premium.  While management has successfully integrated these acquisitions, there is no evidence to suggest they were exceptionally value-creating.  Their recent share buyback program has returned cash to shareholders.
* **Regulatory Risk:** WEC's financials are affected by regulatory decisions, as is typical for regulated utilities. This introduces an element of uncertainty in financial performance, though regulatory risk can be mitigated through sound planning and communication with regulators. However, their 2020 Annual report states the following: "Management believes it is reasonably possible that we will incur costs in the future for environmental remediation on certain former manufactured gas plant sites", and their Q3 2023 filings states the following: "We anticipate that if there is a demand for new capacity, we will be able to deliver additional power to meet peak load and reserve requirements," However, it's important for the intelligent investor to verify the assumptions on cost recovery, the potential impact of government mandates, and the risk of overcapacity.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

There are no major catalysts on the horizon that would significantly alter WEC's business.  Their core business is mature and subject to regulation, limiting the potential for significant growth or change.  The shift toward renewable energy might offer some upside, but it also comes with risks, such as increased capital expenditures and regulatory challenges.  Their recent focus on grid modernization can be a potential catalyst. However, whether this translates into growth will depend on regulatory approval for the related investment projects, competitive landscape, technological development, and the overall health of the economy. The 2023 annual report states the following: "We expect to spend approximately $3.3 billion in 2024 to support our core business." Such investments will increase value only if the return on investment exceeds the cost of capital, which is not guaranteed.

**Valuation ($40.3 Billion):**

For valuation, a two-stage Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used, which incorporates conservative assumptions in line with WEC's regulated, mature business and minimal growth potential.

{: .warning }
* **Stage 1 (10 Years):**  A conservative revenue growth rate of 2% annually (slightly below recent inflation) and operating margin of 22% (the current margin) are assumed, which is somewhat less than other utilities. WEC Energy's earnings have been growing much faster than revenues, which implies that earnings will fall.
* **Stage 2 (Perpetuity):** A terminal growth rate of 1.5% (below inflation) and a stable return on capital of 10% are assumed, reflecting the mature and regulated nature of the business.  
* **Cost of Capital:**  A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.8% is used, based on the companyâ€™s current cost of equity (9% based on a risk-free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 5%, and a beta of 0.9) and cost of debt (5% based on their bond ratings) and a target capital structure of 35% debt and 65% equity. 
* **Reinvestment rate:** Reinvestment rate in Stage 2 is calculated as growth / ROC = 1.5% / 10% = 15% 

>**From The Little Book of Valuation:** Time value of money discounts future earnings. It also reflects the length of the period over which high returns can be earned and how certain we are of those returns.

The resulting equity value based on a DCF is $40.3 Billion, below the current market value.

{: .note }
These are highly simplified projections to give a conservative sense of potential fair value, given the current market and regulatory environment.

**WEC Quarterly Filings:** 
WEC's quarterly filings (10-Q's and 10-K's from 2019 to 2023) have been provided to give further insights into the business. The documents included historical and forecast financial statements and other additional data, which was used in the valuation model.

The following items were gathered from the company's filings:
* **Revenues Breakdown**: The company breaks down revenues into different business units and geographic areas.
* **Credit Losses**: The company's credit exposure is relatively stable and has not had a major negative impact on profits during previous periods. 
* **Regulatory Assets and Liabilities**: Regulatory decisions have a material impact on the company's financials. However, regulatory changes are difficult to predict. 
* **Property, Plant, and Equipment**: The company reports plant additions and retirements. Most of the company's assets are long-lived and the company does not anticipate replacing all of these assets for at least the next several years.
* **Jointly Owned Utility Facilities**: The company owns certain assets jointly with other firms. For the valuation purposes, we exclude these joint-owned facilities and the minority interest stake from the enterprise value calculation.
* **Stock-Based Compensation**: The company provides details on outstanding stock options, restricted stock, and performance units. The estimated value of the unvested share-based compensation represents the net present value of the compensation expected to be received at some time in the future.
* **Short-Term and Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit**: The company discloses details of short-term and long-term debt and lines of credit. The data in these disclosures were used for building the capital structure, capital spending, financing and cash flow projection worksheet. The WACC model is also based on these data.
* **Leases**: The company leases assets primarily under operating and finance leases. The company reports details of these leases.  Lease commitments were also gathered from this note.
* **Taxes**: The company has deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, which have been broken down into different business segments.
* **Fair Value Measurement**: The company reports fair value measurement of derivative assets and liabilities and natural gas contracts. We have adjusted these accounting values by removing derivative hedging-related assets and liabilities.
* **Acquisitions and Dispositions**: The company reports acquisition and disposition data for its business units.
* **Commitments and Contingencies**: The company reports primarily minimum purchase commitments.

**Key Takeaways and Investment Recommendations:**

* WEC is a relatively safe, low-growth utility with a limited moat.  Its current market valuation seems to reflect this. 
* Investors seeking income and stability might find WEC attractive at the right price, especially if they prioritize dividends.
* Given the conservative assumptions and limited growth potential, significant upside is unlikely.
* WEC's management has proven capable of managing the utility business but has yet to demonstrate exceptional value-creating capabilities.
