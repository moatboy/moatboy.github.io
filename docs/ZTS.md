Pessimistic value: $74 billion

Zoetis, a leading animal health company, enjoys a solid, albeit not impenetrable, economic moat stemming from intangible assets (brand recognition and regulatory approvals) and switching costs associated with its pharmaceutical products. However, competitive pressures and industry trends warrant a cautious outlook.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

* **Intangible Assets:** Zoetis benefits from strong brand recognition among veterinarians, which translates into pricing power for its established product lines. Regulatory approvals also create barriers to entry, especially for new drug development, as seen in the company's discussion of the time it takes to get drugs approved in their Q2 2023 earnings call. However, the moat provided by intangible assets is not absolute, as brands can lose their luster over time and patents eventually expire. Generic competition, although not immediate, is an ever-present threat that limits the durability of this advantage, as discussed in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth".
* **Switching Costs:** The cost of switching animal medications can be significant for veterinarians and pet owners.  As explained in Pat Dorsey's book, this stickiness comes from the hassle of finding new medications, obtaining client buy-in, and potential adverse reactions to new treatments. This stickiness is evident in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call, where management highlighted consistent growth in its companion animal segment despite a challenging economic environment. These costs, while real, are not insurmountable.
* **Network Effect (Limited):** There is a network effect to some extent in livestock drugs that ties farmers to veterinarians, as it benefits veterinarians to prescribe familiar medications to their clients. 

{: .warning }

The animal health industry is experiencing increased competition. This places downward pressure on margins and may challenge the sustainability of Zoetis' moat over the long term. In Q2 2023 earnings call, management noted increased competition in the parasiticides market. The entry of generics poses another challenge, particularly as some of the company's key patents near expiration, as mentioned in its Q1 2023 earnings call.


**Management (3/5):**

* **History and Experience:** Zoetis boasts a long history in the animal health industry, dating back to its origins as a part of Pfizer. Managementâ€™s recent track record, however, warrants some skepticism.  While the company has delivered solid financial results, their capital allocation decisions have been questionable at times.  For example, in the Q4 2022 earnings call, management acknowledged challenges integrating recent acquisitions, a classic misstep, as highlighted in "The Essays of Warren Buffett".
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation, while substantial, is largely tied to standard metrics, which may incentivize short-term financial engineering, a concern raised by Warren Buffett in his writings.
* **Insider Ownership:** Moderate insider ownership suggests some alignment with shareholders, but it's not enough to fully mitigate agency risk, which is a point discussed in the revised edition of "The Intelligent Investor".
* **Communication:** Management's communication appears generally transparent, although, like many companies, they tend to focus on positive narratives, as noted in "Valuation".  A closer look at their quantitative disclosures and strategic explanations is warranted to get a clearer picture of the company's true economic performance.
* **Capital Allocation:** Zoetis has returned significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. However, their acquisition strategy has been less consistent, as seen with the challenges in integrating recent acquisitions. 
{: .important }

A more cautious, organic approach to growth may be a safer path, as emphasized in "The Essays of Warren Buffett".  In the company's Q4 2022 earnings call, management acknowledged that their acquisition-heavy strategy had led to some integration issues.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **New Product Launches:** Zoetis has a robust pipeline of new products and is investing heavily in R&D, both key elements of an "economic moat", according to "The Little Book that Builds Wealth". Success with new product launches could drive organic growth and expand their moat. However, the success of new products is inherently uncertain, especially given increasing competition, as outlined in the company's 2023 10-K annual report. The payoff is high, but so is the risk.
* **Emerging Markets:** Zoetis has a growing presence in emerging markets, which offer growth potential.  However, as discussed in "Valuation", emerging markets carry higher risk due to macroeconomic and political instability. Management highlighted their global expansion plans in their Q1 2023 earnings call, but this should be viewed with caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty around the globe, which the company discusses in their Q4 2022 earnings call.
* **Cost-Cutting Initiatives:**  Zoetis has implemented cost-cutting initiatives to improve margins, as mentioned in several recent earnings calls. The success of these initiatives, however, remains to be seen, and excessive cost-cutting can be detrimental to long-term growth, a concern highlighted by Aswath Damodaran.

**Valuation ($74 billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model provides a reasonable framework for valuing Zoetis. To build the model, I used financial data from Zoetis's 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023 10-K and 10-Q filings. Key inputs and assumptions are detailed below.


1. **Revenues:** Projecting a slowdown in the company's growth rate given increasing competition and macroeconomic uncertainty, I assumed a 2% annual growth rate in revenues for the next five years, followed by a stable growth rate of 3% in perpetuity. In actuality, during the Q1 2023 earnings call management guided for annual revenue growth of low-to-mid single digits.


2. **Margins:** The stable growth state profit margin is assumed to be 15% in operating income as a percentage of sales. This is in line with historical profit margins for established players in this industry.


3. **Reinvestment:** The reinvestment rate in stable growth is estimated by using the stable profit margin and return on equity. Based on stable growth free cash flow and return on new investments, reinvestment rate would be around 10%.


4. **Cost of Capital:**  Using a risk-free rate of 4.10% (the yield on the 10-Year US treasury bond), an equity risk premium of 4.5% (based on historical data) and a beta of 0.81. I estimated Zoeti's cost of equity to be approximately 7.75%. Based on Zoetis's current (as of September 30, 2023) and long-term capital structure, I estimated an after-tax cost of debt and a cost of capital (WACC) to be 4.27% and 7.56% respectively.


5. **Other Adjustments:** The company's financials were adjusted to account for the nonoperating assets and debt which should not be part of operating assets.


{: .note }

Using these inputs in a DCF model, with pessimistic growth assumptions based on competitive pressures, and an increased discount rate, yields an estimated fair value for the company of approximately $74 billion, which represents an earnings multiple of 15 times earnings. This is below the market capitalization but suggests the stock is still probably overvalued given my skeptical outlook.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues:** Zoetis derives the bulk of its revenues from companion animal products (dogs, cats, and horses), a segment experiencing stable growth, as highlighted by management in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call. The livestock segment contributes a smaller but significant portion of revenues. In their Q1 2023 earnings call, management noted an interesting new revenue pathway created by focusing on outcomes related to livestock productivity. However, there may be regulatory and legal obstacles to actually implementing this system.


* **Trends:** The animal health industry is consolidating, with a few large players dominating the global market. This trend, however, means rising competition, as discussed in the "Industry Analysis" section of "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies". Competition is particularly intense in the parasiticide market for companion animals, and management expects this headwind to continue for the foreseeable future, as mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call.


* **Margins:** Zoetis boasts strong operating profit margins, but these are under pressure from rising competition, as outlined in recent earnings calls.
{: .important }

Margins are expected to continue to decline gradually over the next few years due to rising competition from the generics market.


* **Competitive Landscape:**  Zoetis' key competitors include Elanco, Merck, and Boehringer Ingelheim. The company emphasizes innovation and customer service as key differentiators, as seen in recent earnings calls. There is some discussion of market share shifts in the company's Q1 2023 earnings call, with the company noting its increased market share in diagnostics, driven by its reference lab and point of care businesses. However, they also lost market share in parasiticides due to competition and generics.


* **What Makes Zoetis Different?:**  Zoetis is a pure-play animal health company, unlike some of its diversified competitors. This focus allows them to allocate resources efficiently and build expertise in a growing market.


**Financial Overview:**

Zoetis has delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in recent years, driven in part by acquisitions, but they still face the problems of integrating the recently acquired firms, as they acknowledge in their Q2 2023 earnings call. However, as mentioned in "The Intelligent Investor", growth through acquisitions is significantly less valuable than organic growth.

**Additional Notes:**
The company recently faced controversy in Q4 2022 due to a cyber security incident in their Irish manufacturing facility. The plant had to stop production entirely for a week and incurred significant costs to resolve the security issue. Management discussed this incident in their Q4 2022 earnings call, highlighting the importance of business continuity planning. Although they don't anticipate any long-term negative financial impact they noted the possibility of operational disruptions in the future.

{: .new }

Zoetis recently announced a leadership change, as their CEO Kristin Peck recently stepped down and was replaced by the company's CFO Wetteny Joseph, in January 2024. This transition was discussed in the company's Q3 2023 earnings call. The impact of a CEO and CFO transition at Zoetis, according to the research paper "The CEO Lifecycle" presented in this document, may be a minor factor in the short term, although longer term it can be a major factor if the replacement has a similar or different approach towards innovation and efficiency. As mentioned in the company's Q4 2023 earnings call, Joseph will continue the focus on margin expansion and operating leverage. The extent to which his leadership tenure will positively or negatively affect shareholder returns is difficult to predict and will depend primarily on the external environment and the quality of Zoetis' products and services.
