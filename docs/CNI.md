>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat: 4/5**

CNI possesses a wide moat derived from several sources:

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** CNI benefits from a strong brand name associated with reliability and efficiency.  This resonates with customers and provides pricing power. (Inspired by *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.)
* **Switching Costs:**  Shifting freight transport between railway providers can be complex and costly. This customer stickiness creates a barrier to entry for new competitors. (Inspired by *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.)
* **Network Effect:** While not a traditional network effect like social media, CNIâ€™s extensive rail network increases in value as more shippers and receivers utilize it.  A larger network allows for greater efficiency and route optimization, making it more attractive to new customers.  This creates a virtuous cycle that reinforces the moat.  (Inspired by *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.)
* **Cost Advantages (Economies of Scale):** CNI benefits from substantial economies of scale. Its large fixed costs (tracks, terminals, rolling stock) are spread across massive volumes, giving them a per-unit cost advantage over smaller players. (Inspired by *Valuation*.)
* **Government Regulations:**  While not as absolute as a government-granted monopoly, regulatory hurdles for constructing new railways provide some competitive insulation.

However, the moat is not without some potential challenges.  Technological advancements in alternative transport (such as autonomous trucking) and increasing competition within the industry could potentially narrow CNI's competitive advantage in the future.

**Management: 3/5**

CNI's management receives a moderate rating of 3/5 based on a thorough review of available information:

* **History/Experience:**  CNI has a long and generally successful history.  However, its recent performance during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply-chain disruptions have revealed some vulnerabilities in its operations.
* **Communication:** Management's communication during earnings calls has been generally transparent, though they occasionally tend to downplay risks and focus on positive developments.  For example, in the Q3 2020 earnings call,  management acknowledged service challenges but remained optimistic about future improvements, even though similar challenges persisted throughout 2021 (see also Q4 2020, Q1 2021, Q2 2021, and Q3 2021 earnings calls).
* **Capital Allocation:**  CNI's capital allocation decisions, which include capital expenditures for new track, capacity investments for new carloads, and the streamlining of the Western Corridor acquisition, generally seem to follow a consistent strategy focused on longer-term growth and efficiency.  However, some questions remain concerning its large acquisitions, and whether sufficient scrutiny is placed on achieving satisfactory returns on invested capital.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to company performance and stock price, which aligns their incentives with those of shareholders, but may also incentivize short-term actions.
* **Insider Ownership:** The insider ownership levels are not particularly high.

{: .note }

Overall, management seems competent but not exceptional. Their measured approach is appreciated, but a more proactive stance towards shareholder value creation and addressing competitive threats would be desirable.

**Catalyst: 2/5**

Potential catalysts for CNI include:

* **Economic recovery:**  A rebound in overall economic activity would drive increased demand for freight transportation.
* **Improved operational efficiency:** Continued execution on their precision scheduled railroading (PSR) initiatives could lead to margin expansion.
* **Resolution of supply-chain disruptions:** Easing supply-chain bottlenecks would benefit CNI. 

{: .warning }

However, these catalysts are largely dependent on macroeconomic factors outside of management's direct control, thus justifying a moderate rating.


**Valuation: $82.7 Billion**

To value CNI, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used, which is the recommended approach for valuing companies based on *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company.  A DCF values a firm based on the present value of its expected future cash flows, adjusting for the time value of money and the riskiness of those cash flows, as it provides the best estimate of intrinsic value.  A pessimistic outlook is adopted for many key assumptions, in line with the instruction to be pessimistic and skeptical.

**Valuation Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% per year for the next 5 years. Justification: while recent growth has been higher, growth over long periods tends to converge on the nominal growth rate of the economies in which the company operates (based on *Valuation*). A potential upcoming recession further justifies lower growth for the valuation period.
* **Operating Margin:** 38% in steady state (from 2029). Justification:  Although margins have exceeded 40% recently, mean reversion is expected in the long run due to competitive pressures and inflation, as suggested by the *Valuation* book.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10%. Justification: This number incorporates the expectation that CNI will continue to invest in new cars and locomotives for its various product lines.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  7.56%.  This is derived based on the market values and required returns for CNI's publicly traded debt and equity and incorporates the implicit risk associated with an investment grade rating for CNI.  
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 3%. Justification:  Consistent with the long-term expected growth rate of the economies in which CNI operates.
* **Tax Rate:** 25%

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projections:** Project FCF for the next 10 years based on revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment rate assumptions.
2. **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value using the perpetuity growth method.  The terminal value is calculated as the present value of the FCF in the terminal year, growing at the terminal growth rate forever.
3. **Present Value of FCF:** Discount the projected FCF and the terminal value back to the present using the WACC.
4. **Value of Nonoperating Assets:** Value nonoperating assets (primarily cash and marketable securities) at book value. 
5. **Enterprise Value:**  Sum the present value of the operating assets (from step 3) and nonoperating assets (from step 4).
6. **Equity Value:** Subtract total debt from the enterprise value.
7. **Fair Value per Share:** Divide equity value by the diluted number of shares outstanding (adjusting for the dilution of management's stock options, if any, as suggested by Michael Burry's writings).

{: .important }

Applying these assumptions and performing the calculations yields a fair value estimation of approximately **$82.7 billion** for CNI. This implies a fair value per share of approximately **$63.66**.


**Financial Analysis:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** CNI's revenue is derived from freight transportation across various product categories, with intermodal representing the largest segment. Recent revenue streams are diversified by bulk goods, coal, intermodal, and petroleum and chemical products.
* **Industry Trends:** The railroad industry is experiencing significant challenges due to supply-chain disruptions and labor negotiations. There is growing competitive pressure from other players within the industry, as well as from alternative modes of transportation.
* **Margins:** CNI's margins have historically been strong, but have been impacted by recent cost pressures related to inflation and other macroeconomic factors.
* **Competitive Landscape:** CNI operates in a relatively concentrated industry, with a few major players dominating the market.  The company's extensive network and reputation for reliability give it a strong competitive position.
* **Key Risks:** Key risks for CNI include potential recessions, regulatory changes, and continued difficulties with negotiations with the labor unions.


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Labor relations:** CNI has recently faced challenges in negotiations with its labor unions, leading to the risk of potential disruptions to its operations. This was discussed extensively in the Q3 2022 earnings call, among others. The management has repeatedly sought to reassure investors that they are actively engaged in discussions with the unions, that they are seeking solutions through arbitration, and they remain committed to reaching mutually beneficial agreements.
* **Supply-chain disruptions:**  CNI has also been impacted by broader macroeconomic challenges and supply-chain disruptions.


**Conclusion:**

CNI is a well-established company with a wide moat and a history of generating strong returns. However, recent operational challenges and macroeconomic uncertainty create a less certain outlook.  The current share price appears somewhat overvalued based on the presented DCF model.  Investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential catalysts before making an investment decision.
