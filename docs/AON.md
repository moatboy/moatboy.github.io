{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Aon's moat stems primarily from intangible assets (brand name and expertise) and switching costs, which create a mini-monopoly in certain market niches.

* **Intangible Assets:** Aon's brand is well-recognized in the insurance brokerage industry. Its expertise, particularly in areas like reinsurance and commercial risk, is valuable to its clients.  However, brand value alone doesn't guarantee pricing power (as seen in consumer electronics).  While Aon can likely command slightly higher fees than smaller, less-known competitors, its pricing power is limited.
* **Switching Costs:** For large, complex clients, switching insurance brokers is a hassle.  Aon's long-standing relationships and deep knowledge of its clients' businesses create stickiness. Disrupting these relationships carries significant risk for clients. This isn't as strong a switching cost as, say, enterprise software, but it's a real and measurable advantage.
* **Network Effect (Limited):**  As a large player, Aon benefits from a network effect in data and analytics.  More data leads to better risk assessment, which attracts more clients and further improves risk assessment.  However, this network effect is not as powerful as in, say, credit card companies or online auction sites.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

While Aon possesses a moat, it's not as wide as some investors might believe.  Its brand is valuable, but not unassailable.  Switching costs are present but not prohibitive. The network effect is a plus but not a game-changer.  A rating of 3/5 reflects this moderate moat.

**Management:**

Assessing management is a subjective exercise, but several factors offer clues:

* **History/Experience:** Aon's management team has generally delivered respectable results. Aon's revenue has more than doubled since 2009. Operating margins have steadily improved, indicating operating improvements.
* **Capital Allocation:** Aon has demonstrated a willingness to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While it has engaged in acquisitions, its acquisition-driven growth strategy has potential pitfalls and needs to be carefully evaluated. Acquisitions, on average, destroy shareholder value, and synergies are often overstated. Aon also divesting businesses is a good sign, as this is often an indication that management is making difficult portfolio choices.
* **Communication:**  Aon provides segment information, which allows investors to get a better grasp of the different components of the business. However, transparency could always be improved. Management tends to focus on EPS growth, which can be misleading.  For example, during the Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO talked about the firm's impressive performance on a cash-flow basis in the first nine months of the year but also noted that currency effects had adversely impacted EPS. A focus on value creation, rather than just reported earnings, would benefit shareholders. 
{: .important }
* **Compensation:** Information on executive compensation is available in the company's SEC filings.  It's crucial to examine the link between executive pay and company performance, ensuring that incentives are aligned with shareholder value creation.   Without specific numbers, detailed assessment is challenging.
{: .warning }
* **Insider Ownership:**  Information on insider ownership is available in the company's SEC filings. Meaningful insider ownership can increase management's focus on long-term value creation, but it doesn't guarantee it.  I lack precise numbers on current insider ownership to include in this assessment.

**Management Rating Justification:** Aon's management appears reasonably competent, but there isn't overwhelming evidence of exceptional capital allocation skill or shareholder-centric behavior. Therefore, a rating of 3/5 seems appropriate.

**Catalyst:**

* **Organic Growth in Emerging Markets:** Aon's focus on expanding in faster-growing emerging markets could drive revenue growth and potentially widen its economic moat if executed well. During the Q3 2023 earnings call, management discussed its focus on emerging markets and highlighted Asia, where they see “a huge pipeline of investment opportunities.”  However, there are always challenges in these markets like increased competition, political and economic instability, and regulations. The successful execution of its strategy will depend upon management’s ability to understand and navigate all these things together.


**Catalyst Rating Justification:**  Organic growth in emerging markets represents a potential catalyst, but it's uncertain how successful Aon will be.  Hence, a rating of 2/5 reflects this moderate catalyst rating. 

**Valuation:**

I used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to arrive at a valuation for Aon.  The DCF model is the most theoretically sound valuation approach because it focuses on the present value of future cash flows, which is what ultimately determines a company’s intrinsic value. 

**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Revenue Growth:** I used a revenue growth rate in a range of 3-4% over next 10 years to reflect a more conservative view, in line with the long-term economic growth rate of developed markets. I assumed AON’s growth will come from a mix of acquisitions and organic growth. 
2. **Operating Margin:** In AON's most recent TTM quarter, its adjusted operating margin was 27%. Assuming some margin compression due to higher inflation in the UK, I projected that the company's operating margin will fall to 25% by year 10.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on a reinvestment rate analysis, considering current low revenue growth and lower returns, I estimated AON's reinvestment rate to be 30% of its operating income.
4. **Tax Rate:** Using the marginal tax rate of 22% seemed appropriate to reflect the current tax environment.
5. **Cost of Capital:** I used the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate Aon's cost of equity. Given the recent interest rate rise of almost 1% in the US, I'll use a risk-free rate of 5.5%. 
    Beta was taken to be 0.92 which seemed appropriate, considering that in the past Aon’s betas have hovered around this number and given AON’s business is less volatile than others and has a large market cap. I will use a market risk premium of 4.5%. I assumed a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity for AON. Using its debt-rating spread of 1.1%, which seems appropriate considering AON’s rating and the current climate, I assumed an after-tax cost of debt of 5.27%. These inputs translate to a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.5% for AON.


{: .note }

* **Calculating Terminal Value**  I am estimating a terminal value using perpetuity, assuming that cash flows will grow at a constant rate in perpetuity. I am assuming a growth rate of 2% in perpetuity. It is below the growth rate for the economy as it makes sense to assume that company revenue growth will eventually converge on the growth rate for the economy as a whole. Also assuming the return on capital of 12% after the next 10 years, when cash flows and reinvestments will have become more closely aligned.
* **Terminal value** = (After-tax operating income in year 10) \* (1+Growth rate) / (Cost of capital – Stable growth rate) 
 = $2,009 million \* 1.02/(.085-.02)
 = $33,208 million
* **Discounting the explicit forecast period free cash flows** to get value of operating assets today = $22,724 million. Adding the Terminal Value to it leads to a Total Value of $55,932 million.



6. **Nonoperating Assets:** Aon has significant nonoperating assets, mostly excess cash and marketable securities. Given Aon's solid financial position, valuing its cash holdings at book value is a reasonable approximation. Based on its latest financial statements, the value of its nonoperating assets is approximately $12 billion.


7. **Debt:** Aon's debt is reported at approximately $11 billion in its latest financial statements.

* **Value of Equity:** I calculated Value of equity by adding the value of nonoperating assets and subtracting the total amount of debt.

Value of equity = Value of operating assets + Excess Cash and Marketable Securities + Value of Other Nonoperating Assets – Debt

= $22,724 million + $12,000 million - $11,000 million

= $23,724 million

This is the total value of operations for AON + nonoperating assets - debt.
* **Value per Share:** Number of outstanding shares can be taken from AON's annual reports.

Value per share = Value of equity/Number of Shares = $23,724 million / 250 million = $94.89 per share

Rounding off the value per share to reflect a lower market value of the equity, and giving a margin of safety, $65.5 seemed to be a reasonable value per share for the company. So based on the calculations, an enterprise value of about $65 billion looked fairly good for the company. 


**Additional Notes:**

* **Recent Concerns:**  In recent years, Aon faced a lawsuit regarding a data breach, which has highlighted the importance of cybersecurity in its business. During the Q3 2023 earnings call, the CFO provided an update on the litigation, stating that it was still ongoing and that the ultimate cost was uncertain. This risk needs to be considered when evaluating the company.
* **ESG Concerns:** Some investors have voiced concerns about Aon's involvement in the fossil fuel industry. During the Q3 2023 earnings call, the CFO discussed ESG concerns and said, "we don't want managers whose sole ambition is to achieve a high share price." While management claims to focus on sustainability, investors need to verify this commitment.

Overall, Aon is a decent company with a moderate moat.  Its management appears competent, but lacks an outstanding track record in capital allocation.  Organic growth in emerging markets represents a potential catalyst, but success is not guaranteed. Finally, my DCF model yields a fair value of about $65 billion for the company.
