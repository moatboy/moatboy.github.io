{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Otis benefits from some scale advantages, particularly in service, where its large installed base creates high switching costs for customers. Repairing or modernizing an elevator is a significant undertaking, and building owners are incentivized to stick with the original installer (Otis) due to their familiarity with the equipment, quicker response times, and established service contracts.  However, this advantage is tempered by the increasing commoditization of new installations, where price competition is intensifying. The company’s growth is being driven in large part by its Service business, which benefits from high margins due to recurring maintenance and modernization contracts. These two attributes would lead to assigning an initial moat rating of 3.

> From the Q3 2023 earnings call: "…we're seeing kind of a little bit of a price war developing in certain markets as well... We're also seeing the new equipment business become more competitive overall." - CEO Judy Marks.

This statement, along with increasing competitiveness in other segments of Otis' business, and management's admission that pricing pressures are developing in some markets leads to a reduction in the moat rating to 2.

**Management (3/5):**

Otis's management team, led by CEO Judy Marks, has a mixed record.  On the positive side, they have successfully navigated the company's spin-off and subsequent public listing.  They have also articulated a clear strategy focused on capturing growth in emerging markets and expanding service revenue. Marks has emphasized improved modernization and product offerings in recent calls. Further,  management has also embarked on cost-cutting initiatives, and as per the Q2 2021 Earnings Call, "…we've introduced the Otis Business System or OBS. It has a relentless focus on our field productivity and efficiency."  However, the aforementioned price war is concerning. Further, profitability in New Equipment has been under pressure. Based on historical performance, execution, and communication, a baseline score of 3 is assigned.  The limited insider ownership and high executive compensation relative to peers reduce confidence in management's commitment to shareholder value maximization, reinforcing the score of 3.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Otis has the potential to benefit from secular tailwinds such as urbanization and infrastructure spending in emerging markets.  > In the Q3 2023 Earnings Call, the CFO acknowledged that, "…China, obviously, was a little bit of a disappointment this quarter…"  While near-term headwinds exist in some key markets, long-term urbanization and development, such as in India, should provide opportunities for the firm. However, there's nothing in recent news, earnings calls, or company documents that points toward a major, imminent catalyst. Thus, a rating of 2 is assigned.

**Valuation ($28.75 Billion):**

{: .important }

**Valuation Methodology:** A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation is used, focusing on Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF), given that Otis is now a separate company with its own debt and financial reporting, unlike when it was part of United Technologies.

{: .important }

**Key Assumptions:** 

* **Base Years for DCF (2010–2013):** Using financials from 10K filings, 2010 being Otis' first full year post-spin-off.
* **Explicit Forecast Years (2014–2023):** A 10-year period, in line with recommended practice for well-established companies.
* **Stable Growth Rate (g):**  3 percent.  Global growth projections for the next 10 years rarely surpass 3% annually. Inflation-adjusted world GDP growth for 2023 was 2.1% according to the World Bank.
* **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** 15 percent.  Although Otis has demonstrated higher historical ROIC, the current competitive environment is challenging. Moreover, sustaining high returns for an extended period of time is difficult.
* **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital):** 8.5 percent.  Derived from the firm's cost of debt (using yield to maturity on its long-term bonds as provided in the 2010 10K), cost of equity (using a simplified CAPM method and an equity risk premium of 4 percent), and debt/equity weights from the 2013 balance sheet. A debt beta of 0.1 is used (as described in Damodaran, assuming a BBB+ credit rating for the company).
* **Reinvestment Rate in stable growth:** 31.9%. Calculated as growth rate/ROIC $=3\%/15\%$.


> The calculation of WACC using data from exhibits in 10K filings is as follows:
> 
Cost of Equity: Risk-free rate + beta \* risk premium $=4.09\% + 1.1 \* 4\% = 8.5\%$ 
Cost of Debt: $6.29\% \* (1 - 25\%) = 4.7\%$
WACC: Cost of Equity \* (Equity/(Debt+Equity)) + Cost of Debt \* (Debt/(Debt+Equity)) $=8.5\% \* (70\%/100\%) + 4.7\% \* (30\%/100\%) = 7.4\%$.


{: .important }

**FCFF Calculation:** 

Otis’s Free cash flow can be computed using after-tax operating income and reinvestment using its annual report of 2010. The reinvestment rate can be computed as follows: (Capital expenditure – Depreciation + Change in non-cash working capital)/ (After-tax operating income)= (226 – 580+44)/(1276\*(1-.25)) = -35.3%. The reinvestment rate is negative which is not surprising given that Otis is divesting more than it is adding to it's net assets. Using the numbers provided in Otis's 10K filings (2010-2013) and assuming a 3% growth and reinvestment rate from 2014 to 2023, FCFF is projected.

{: .important }

**Terminal Value (TV):**

* Using the perpetuity formula, TV at the end of 2023 is: $\text{FCFF}_{2024} / (\text{WACC}-g) = \$2,888/(8.5\%-3\%) = \$49,806$ million.

{: .important }

**Present Value (PV):** Discounting the annual free cash flows and the terminal value back to today at the WACC of 8.5% gives a total enterprise value of approximately **$31,040 million**. Subtracting minority interests and adjusting for cash yields an equity value of **$28,750 million**.  Dividing by the number of shares gives a value per share of **$67.8** (assuming the current number of shares outstanding).  This number represents the firm's value based on a set of assumptions.



> **Recent Concerns:** Otis has been facing headwinds related to supply chains, COVID-19 restrictions, inflation, and slower recovery in China (Q3 2023 Earnings Call).  The management has acknowledged these challenges and is working toward mitigating their impact.  Marks also noted, “…in the second quarter, the industry began to experience price compression for maintenance."


> **Potential Catalysts:**  As discussed in Q4 2022 Earnings Call, urbanization in Asia, especially India should be a key driver in coming years. Further product innovation and expansion of maintenance contracts could act as catalysts for future growth.


Given the inherent uncertainties in valuation, particularly for a company with a shorter history as an independent entity, it's important to treat the estimated value as a starting point for further research.  The valuation is based on a set of pessimistic assumptions, especially concerning the ROIC and growth rate.  A more optimistic outlook on either or both could lead to a higher valuation, while a more pessimistic outlook could lead to a lower valuation.
