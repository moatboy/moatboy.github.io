#### Revenue and Profitability
*   **Revenue Growth:** Over the past several years, Nordson has demonstrated robust revenue growth, with sales increasing in its fiscal year 2023 as seen in their 10K report. This growth is driven by a combination of factors: strong organic growth, contributions from acquired businesses and growth in end markets.

*   **Gross margin:** Is pretty good at roughly 50%.

*   **Strong operating margins**, especially compared with other manufacturing companies.
*    **Return on invested capital (ROIC):** A metric that has historically varied between 15-25%. The company targets ROIC as a metric to drive value. However, note that ROIC might be overstated because of the company excluding goodwill.

### Moat Analysis: 3 / 5
Nordson exhibits elements of an economic moat, but not a wide moat.
*   **Intangible Assets:** They benefit from strong brand name, especially in their high-precision and complex products, like dispensing and fluid management technologies, which allows them to charge premium.
*   **Switching costs:** Customers face high costs to change between different fluid delivery systems because that involves extensive re-training and equipment modifications.
*   **Scale and Cost Advantage:** While having a large distribution network, they also have production and manufacturing advantages in some sectors, which gives them some cost advantages.
*   **Niche market economics**: They tend to be the go-to provider for specialized technologies.

*Justification for a 3/5 rating:*
*   The company's wide distribution networks and proprietary technologies form a narrow moat.
*   However, the increasing complexity of the global manufacturing environment makes competition ever-present. The competitive advantages, although real, are constantly under threat.
*    A narrow-moat rating reflects that the moat may not last for decades, but will provide a competitive advantage for some time to come.

### Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience
There are several risks to Nordson's moat and its business, including:
*   **Technological Obsolescence:** Rapid innovation in industrial and electronics industries can quickly make some of their technologies and products obsolete.
*   **Competition:** Increasing competition from other suppliers and new entrants could squeeze the profitability of the company.
*   **Economic Cycles:** Demand for its products depends highly on the economic climate. Recessions and industry downturns could result in lower sales and profits.
*    **Customer Concentration**: Some of their larger customers may be able to demand lower prices.
*   **Acquisition Risk:** Given that growth through acquisitions is a significant part of its business model, the potential for failed mergers, integrations or overpaying for acquisitions is a genuine risk.
*  **Pricing pressure**: As customer preferences and other industry dynamics change, there may be pressures to reduce the prices.
*  **Supply chain issues**: Supply chain bottlenecks could increase costs and delay production and reduce the capacity of the company to serve its clients.
*  **Cyber security**: If cyber attacks compromise the company's systems, customer data may be exposed, and this could result in financial repercussions and other penalties.

*Business Resilience*
*   Nordson has shown resilience during times of economic uncertainty due to its wide customer base and diversification across different industries.
*   The company's investment into innovation and cost management techniques positions them for growth and profitability.
