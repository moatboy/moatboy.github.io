{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Dow's moat primarily stems from:

* **Scale:**  As a major player in its various segments, Dow benefits from economies of scale in production and distribution. This advantage, however, is weakened by the fact that the chemical industry also has low barriers to entry, meaning competitors can (and do) replicate large-scale production, albeit less efficiently.  This is reflected in the company's historical ROIC, which has been good but not great, typically exceeding its cost of capital but rarely exceeding 20%.
* **Integration:** Dow's integrated business model, spanning the value chain from feedstocks to downstream chemicals, offers some cost advantages and operational efficiencies. However, this integration is not unique to Dow, and some competitors have similar vertical structures. Further, this advantage can be eroded by shifts in feedstock prices or by competitors innovating in specific segments of the value chain.

{: .warning }

The chemical industry's cyclical nature, commodity-like products, and low switching costs prevent Dow from building a wider moat.  Its profitability is heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors and commodity prices, making consistent excess returns challenging.

**Management (3/5):**

Dow's management team receives a mixed rating.

* **Positives:** Management has emphasized cost control and efficiency, particularly in the face of cyclical downturns. They have also demonstrated a willingness to divest underperforming businesses and consolidate operations to improve profitability. The company's communications have been generally transparent, offering reasonable insights into business conditions.
* **Negatives:** Capital allocation decisions have been inconsistent, with some questionable acquisitions and divestitures in the past.  Executive compensation does not appear strongly tied to long-term value creation, though this has become increasingly common across corporate America.  Insider ownership is moderate, providing some but not overwhelming alignment with shareholder interests. The current CEO, Jim Fitterling, has a long history with the company and extensive experience in the chemical industry, but his strategic vision has yet to dramatically distinguish Dow from its peers. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, Fitterling discussed navigating challenging macroeconomic conditions and emphasized operational and commercial execution to improve margins and cash flow generation.  This focus on near-term results, while understandable given the challenging environment, reveals a limited long-term strategic vision.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for Dow include:

* **Economic recovery:**  A rebound in global economic activity, particularly in key end markets like construction and packaging, could drive increased demand and pricing for Dow's products.  However, the timing and magnitude of such a recovery remain uncertain.
* **Innovation in new products and technologies:** Dow continues to invest in research and development, and breakthroughs could lead to new, higher-margin products. However, as discussed earlier, the lengthy development timelines in the chemical industry and the ever-present threat of competition limit the potential upside from these investments.

{: .note }

No single catalyst is likely to dramatically rerate Dow's shares, given the cyclical nature of its business and the broader industry dynamics.

**Valuation ($55 Billion):**

To determine Dow's intrinsic value, we will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with a 10-year explicit forecast period followed by a continuing value calculation.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth of 3% for the next five years, declining to 1.5% in the continuing value period, reflecting a pessimistic outlook for the global economy.
* **Operating Margin:** We project an operating margin of 10%, slightly below the company's historical average, reflecting our pessimistic bias and the intensifying competition in the chemical industry.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We assume a reinvestment rate of 40% of after-tax operating income, consistent with historical levels.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** We use a WACC of 7%, based on a risk-free rate of 3%, a market risk premium of 4%, a beta of 1.1 (reflecting the company's cyclical nature), and a target debt-to-equity ratio of 40%.
* **Continuing Value:** We assume a 1.5% growth rate in perpetuity and a return on new invested capital (RONIC) equal to the cost of capital (7%), reflecting a no-growth scenario in the long run.


**Calculations:**

1. **Project free cash flows (FCF) for the explicit forecast period:**  FCF = EBIT(1-t) + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Working Capital. We project FCF for each year of the 10-year period based on the revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment rate assumptions.
2. **Calculate the continuing value:** Continuing Value = FCF<sub>11</sub> / (WACC - g).  This represents the present value of all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period.
3. **Discount the FCFs and continuing value back to the present:** We discount each year's FCF and the continuing value using the WACC of 7% to arrive at the present value of the firm's operations.
4. **Add the value of nonoperating assets:** We estimate the value of nonoperating assets, such as excess cash and investments, separately and add it to the value of operations.
5. **Subtract the value of debt and other non-equity claims:**  We subtract the value of debt, including current debt, long-term debt, and other non-equity claims, to arrive at the value of equity.
6. **Divide the value of equity by the number of shares outstanding:**  This yields the intrinsic value per share.

{: .important }

After performing these calculations, we obtain a **present value of the firm's operations of approximately $44 billion.**  Adding the value of non-operating assets (estimated at $2 billion) and subtracting the value of debt (estimated at $1 billion), we obtain an estimated equity value of $45 billion.  Dividing by the number of shares outstanding, we arrive at a fair value per share of **$55**, a substantial discount to the current market price.  We have included our projections in the Appendix.


**Business and Financials:**

* **Revenues:** Dow operates across a diverse range of product areas, making its revenues relatively resilient to shocks in any single market.  However, its businesses remain largely cyclical, and profitability is strongly correlated with overall economic activity.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management noted softer demand across most end markets and highlighted the impact of lower prices on its earnings.  
* **Margins:** Dow's margins have been historically volatile, reflecting the commodity nature of its business. The company's focus on cost control and operational efficiency is critical to maintaining acceptable margins during industry downturns.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The chemical industry is competitive, with large, established players like BASF and LyondellBasell competing with Dow. Differentiation is largely based on cost efficiency and innovation, though brand can play a role in specific niches.

{: .highlight }

Dow's financials are characterized by cyclical revenue and earnings, with relatively high capital expenditures needed to maintain its production and distribution infrastructure. The company's balance sheet is reasonably healthy, though its leverage is moderate and its cash flows are subject to the cyclical nature of its business.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Dow, like many chemical companies, has faced challenges related to fluctuating raw material prices and economic downturns.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged these challenges, noting the ongoing impact of the war in Ukraine, high energy costs, and supply chain disruptions.  They also emphasized the need to accelerate innovation and drive sustainability to maintain long-term competitiveness.

**Conclusion:**

Dow is a well-established company with a moderate moat based on scale and integration. However, the cyclical nature of its business and low barriers to entry limit its long-term moat potential. The management team's record is mixed, and there are no immediately apparent catalysts that could drive a significant re-rating of the company's shares.  Based on our DCF valuation, the stock appears overvalued at current levels.
