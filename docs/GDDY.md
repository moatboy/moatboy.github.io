Pessimistic value: $15.4 B

GoDaddy operates in a competitive market but benefits from some switching costs and network effects, earning it a narrow moat rating. Management's capital allocation decisions and communication could be better, leading to a middling management rating. There are some potential catalysts but no obvious game-changers on the horizon, hence a moderate catalyst rating. Based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, with moderately pessimistic assumptions, the fair value is estimated at $15.4 billion.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

GoDaddy is primarily a domain registrar and web hosting provider, but it also offers a suite of other services like website building, online marketing, and e-commerce solutions. Its revenue streams can be broadly classified into:

* **Domains:** This segment includes revenue from domain name registrations and renewals. It is a relatively stable, cash-cow business. In Q4 2020 earnings call the company stated: “Domains business is showing its resilience.”
* **Hosting and Presence:** This segment provides web hosting, website building tools, and other related services. Growth in this segment is linked to growth in website creation and the online economy.
* **Business Applications:** This segment includes email marketing, productivity tools, and other business applications. In Q4 2020 earnings call, the company noted that they saw: “strength in our applications and commerce portfolio.”  This segment is where GoDaddy aims to differentiate itself from competitors.


**Industry Trends and Competitive Landscape:**

The industry is competitive with low switching costs for basic services, particularly in the domain registration business. The emergence of new domain name extensions has intensified competition. However, GoDaddy benefits from economies of scale, brand recognition, and vertical integration, enabling them to offer bundled services at competitive prices. In Q3 2022 earnings call, the company mentioned their focus on: “delivering the best experience on our commerce platform.” This integrated offering with an emphasis on commerce and broader online presence makes GoDaddy different.

Note: Switching costs and network effects are more prominent in the Applications and Commerce segment, where businesses using GoDaddy's tools to build their web presence and e-commerce stores are more deeply integrated.


**Margins:**

GoDaddy operates with healthy margins. Its gross margin is typically in the high 60s. Its operating margin has shown improvement over time, reaching 20% in recent quarters.

**Management Assessment:**

Management's capital allocation decisions have been a mixed bag, with some questionable acquisitions and share repurchases at high valuations. Communication with investors could be more transparent, especially about long-term value drivers. Insider ownership is reasonable, but it is not at the level to inspire full confidence. Management compensation seems high, but within the range of other public technology companies. The management rating is set at 3/5 given these factors.

**Financials - Deep Dive with Justification:**

Analyzing GoDaddy’s financials requires careful reorganization to isolate core operations and account for one-time and acquisition-related distortions. Key data has been extracted from GoDaddy’s SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) for the years 2017-2019 (2020 is used for comparison purposes only)

**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations:**

A three-stage DCF model is used for valuation.

**Stage 1: High-Growth Phase (Years 1-5):**

* Revenue Growth: 8% (Considering recent slowdown in growth, and intensifying competition. This assumption is based on the 10-year revenue CAGR until 2014 of 33% and the expectation that revenue growth will gradually decrease as the company approaches maturity. As the company matures, this number will need to be adjusted downward.)
* Operating Margin: 20% (Management forecasts eventual margins to be 30-35%, but this seems overly optimistic given competitive pressures. The target operating margin is lower at 20%.)
* Reinvestment Rate: 50% (This is lower than what growth companies typically reinvest, reflecting a more conservative outlook.)
* Tax rate: 21%
* Discount rate: 10.8% (using equity market risk premium approach from "The Little Book of Valuation" with beta at 1.4)
* The discounted cash flow of operations equals $7,209 Million

**Stage 2: Moderate-Growth Phase (Years 6-10):**

* Revenue Growth: 4% (Reflecting a more mature company)
* Operating Margin: 22% (Slight improvement based on operating leverage)
* Reinvestment Rate: 30% (Lower reinvestment needed for lower growth)
* Tax rate: 21%
* Discount rate: 10.2%
* The discounted cash flow of operations equals $2,873 Million

**Stage 3: Terminal Value:**

* Stable Growth Rate: 3%
* Reinvestment Rate: 20% (long run ROIC assumed to be 10%)
* Terminal value at end of year 10 = $3,917 million

**Non-operating Assets:**

* Excess cash and marketable securities are valued at $512 million.
* Other investments are assumed to be immaterial.

**Debt and Other Non-equity Claims:**

* Debt is valued at the face value of approximately $1.78 billion. (GoDaddy's debt-to-capital ratio is assumed to remain fairly stable in the long run.)
* Other non-equity claims are considered to be immaterial.

**Valuation Summary**

* Value of operations = 7,209 + 2,873 + 3,917 = $13,999 million.
* Value of non-operating assets = $512 million.
* Total enterprise value = 13,999 + 512 = $14,511 million.
* Equity value = 14,511 - 1,780 = $12,731 million.
* Share count: 449 million
* Fair Value per share = $28.35


**Catalysts:**

* **Expansion into new markets:** GoDaddy is expanding internationally and into new product areas. Success in these efforts could boost growth. In Q3 2019 earning call, GoDaddy mentioned: “focused on expanding our addressable market in new ways.”
* **Increased adoption of online services:** As more businesses move online, GoDaddy's services become more valuable. GoDaddy noted in Q1 2021 that: “we’re seeing more and more people come online.”
* **Product innovation:** GoDaddy is continually developing new products and services. These innovations could increase customer lock-in and pricing power. In the Q2 2022 earnings call, management mentioned their: “customer-inspired product innovation.”
* **Margins improvement:**  As noted earlier, management expects 30-35% operating margins. In the Q2 2022 earnings call management stated: “Our strategy and product innovations continue to drive gross margin expansion” 

**Catalyst Rating: 2/5**

There are potential catalysts, but their impact is uncertain, and the competitive landscape remains challenging. 

**Addressing Concerns:**

One concern is the increasing concentration of the domain registrar market. A further concern is increasing operating costs related to customer acquisition.
Management addressed the customer acquisition cost concerns in the Q2 2022 Earnings call: "we continue to be disciplined in customer acquisition" and "focused on delivering profitability."
These statements indicate that the management is well aware of these issues and actively trying to resolve them. They provide some comfort, but these concerns justify a pessimistic outlook.


**Conclusion:**

GoDaddy operates in a competitive market but benefits from some switching costs and network effects. Although management has been making some questionable capital allocation decisions, the company is profitable and growing steadily, albeit at a slowing rate. The current valuation suggests a slight discount to fair value based on a DCF model with moderately pessimistic assumptions. The company has several potential catalysts that could boost growth, but its future success depends on its ability to navigate a competitive landscape.
