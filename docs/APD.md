>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

APD has a *narrow moat*, which earns a rating of *3 out of 5*. This rating is justified due to the following:

* **Switching Costs:**  Industrial gas customers often face significant costs when switching suppliers. This creates some stickiness in APD's customer base, which qualifies as a source of a narrow moat, according to Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. Setting up new supply lines and integrating them into a customer's infrastructure can be complex and expensive, deterring customers from switching providers. This point was reiterated by Seifi Ghasemi, chairman, president and CEO in Q2 2024 earnings call: *"Our primary focus is on creating value for our long-term investors."*
* **Size Advantage:** In certain geographic areas, APD benefits from economies of scale due to its large production and distribution network.  This advantage primarily appears in the merchant gases business.  This localized advantage is similar to waste-hauling firms and aggregate companies described in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, where businesses are profitable due to their favorable location and regulatory approvals. This is because transporting gases over long distances can be expensive and impractical.  However, this advantage is limited in scope and does not extend to all of APD's business segments.  Large industrial gas customers typically purchase from multiple suppliers to mitigate their risk.

{: .note }

APD's moat is not as wide as some other companies highlighted in the resources, such as those with strong brands or network effects. Its moat is largely limited to its merchant gases segment and is susceptible to erosion if transportation costs decline significantly, or if new technologies make distributed gas production more feasible. Therefore, a rating of 3/5 seems justified.


**Management:**

APD's management earns a rating of *3 out of 5*. 

* **Capital Allocation:** Historically, APD has tended to favor share buybacks and dividends over reinvesting in the business or acquisitions. While buybacks can enhance shareholder returns if done when a stock is undervalued, they do not inherently create value if a company can reinvest its earnings at high rates of return. Management has sometimes pursued acquisitions at times of high valuations (see section on mergers and acquisitions). Also, during the period of heavy share buybacks (2013-2017), the firm did not perform up to its potential (See Morgan Stanley's "*Assessing the Magnitude and Sustainability of Value Creation*").

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation at APD seems excessive. The CEO's salary and perks totaled $26.3 million in the latest year reported. This raises concerns about management prioritizing personal enrichment over shareholder value creation (as mentioned in Warren Buffet's *The Essays of Warren Buffet: Lessons for Corporate America*, where he emphasizes the importance of owner earnings).

* **Communication:** APD's investor relations could be better. Their company filings provide limited detail about their individual business segments, which makes a rigorous competitive analysis a challenge. This is similar to examples in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, where the lack of information creates an illusion of a moat.

* **Long-Term Orientation:**  Management appears committed to the dividend and buyback-centric capital allocation policies. This can be viewed as a lack of commitment to long-term growth, which is usually a prerequisite for large increases in shareholder value. This is discussed thoroughly in *The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham, where he stresses on long-term value and earnings growth.  However, a recent increase in capital expenditures and long-term investments (2021-2023) could be seen as a change in that orientation.

{: .warning }

The current management team has shown a mixed record. While the company has performed reasonably well financially, their buyback-centric capital allocation policy, high executive compensation, and lack of transparency raise concerns. Therefore, a 3/5 rating appears justified, reflecting a moderately positive view.


**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** APD's business can be segmented into two main reporting groups: Industrial Gasesâ€”Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Asia, Global; and Corporate. It also has Industrial Gases Equipment business as well. A portion of APD's revenues is generated under long-term contracts, which provides stability but can also limit pricing flexibility. The industrial gases business is exposed to fluctuations in industrial activity, which makes it somewhat cyclical.

* **Industry Trends:**  The industrial gases industry is consolidating, with the largest players seeking greater scale to reduce costs and improve their bargaining power over customers. This consolidation is beneficial for Air Products, as it reduces the risk of new entrants, as highlighted in Micheal Porter's *Competitive Advantage*, though making new acquisitions becomes more expensive for the buyer as well (As discussed in "*Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*").

* **Margins:**  APD's operating margins are relatively stable but not exceptional, usually falling in the low teens to mid-twenties. This indicates a competitive industry where pricing power is limited. The recent decline in margins can be explained by the increase in energy costs (Q2 2024 earnings call) and by supply chain disruptions (Q3 2023 earnings call).

* **Competitive Landscape:**  APD faces competition from other large, global industrial gas companies like Linde, Air Liquide, and Taiyo Nippon Sanso. The industrial gas industry operates primarily as an oligopoly, with rational discipline in place at times for the biggest players (Morgan Stanley's "*Assessing the Magnitude and Sustainability of Value Creation*")

* **Differentiation:**  APD attempts to differentiate itself through its focus on operational excellence, technological innovation, and customer service.  However, these are difficult to sustain as durable competitive advantages, as shown in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

{: .important }

Overall, APD operates in a mature, competitive industry with limited pricing power. It is seeking growth through acquisitions and expansion in emerging markets.


**Financials:**

* **Revenues** have increased steadily from $8.2 billion in fiscal year 2016 to $12.9 billion in the latest fiscal year reported.
* **Operating Margins** are stable as mentioned earlier.
* **Return on Invested Capital** (ROIC) has historically been high, averaging around 16 percent. However, recent ROIC has declined to about 13 percent in the latest year reported. ROIC will need to be examined on a business segment level to allow for different rates of reinvestment and capital turnover (See "*Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*" for more detail)
* **Debt:** APD has low financial leverage, which provides a margin of safety. Debt-to-capital ratio is approximately 30 percent, with investment grade credit rating (A). It is however worth noting that the company is on the acquisition path at the moment as well and had made several long-term investments as well. Hence, it would be reasonable to assume that debt level is likely to rise.

{: .new }

A key concern is the recent decline in ROIC. If this trend continues, it will negatively impact the company's value. Management has discussed several initiatives to improve profitability, but it remains to be seen whether these initiatives will be successful.


**Valuation:**

To estimate APD's intrinsic value, I will use a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model, focusing on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), as discussed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*. A DCF model explicitly models the key drivers of firm value: return on invested capital (ROIC) and growth. I will assume a *modest revenue growth rate of 2 percent annually and a modest ROIC of 13 percent*, given the maturity and the competitive nature of APD's business as well as the fact that current capital expenditure program is rather ambitious. These assumptions reflect a pessimistic outlook, in line with this report's overall approach.  I will also use a weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) of 8 percent, reflecting the company's low cost of debt and target capital structure. For detailed calculations on discount rates, please check Chapter 11 of "*Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*".

| Year | FCFF ($ billions) | Present Value Factor (8%) | Present Value ($ billions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $1.65 | 0.93 | $1.53 |
| 2 | $1.70 | 0.86 | $1.46 |
| 3 | $1.74 | 0.79 | $1.37 |
| 4 | $1.78 | 0.74 | $1.32 |
| 5 | $1.83 | 0.68 | $1.25 |
| Terminal Value | $39 | 0.68 / (0.08 - 0.02) | $44.7 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** |  |  | **$51.63** |
| Less: Debt ($15 billion as reported in Q3 2024) |  |  | $15 |
| Plus: Cash ($2.5 billion as reported in Q3 2024) |  |  | $2.5 |
| **Value of Equity** |  |  | **$39.13** |
| Number of shares outstanding (511.5 million) |  |  | 511.5 |
| **Value per share** |  |  | **$76.50** |

{: .new }

This valuation is based on current earnings and a pessimistic outlook. If management can deliver stronger growth and ROIC, the value of the company could be higher.


**Catalysts:**

APD earns a *catalyst rating of 2 out of 5*.

* **Acquisitions:**  Successful acquisitions could create value for shareholders, especially if APD can acquire undervalued businesses with durable competitive advantages. As mentioned in "*Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*", acquisitions are the best way to improve returns when organic growth potential is muted.

* **Margin Expansion:** If management can successfully execute its cost reduction and pricing initiatives, margins could expand, leading to higher profits.

{: .warning }

These catalysts are not certain to materialize. Acquisitions can be risky and expensive, and margin improvement can be difficult to achieve in a competitive market.  Thus, a low rating of 2/5 is warranted.


**Concerns and Controversies:**

Recent concerns and controversies faced by APD include:

* **Declining ROIC:** As mentioned earlier, the company's ROIC has been declining in recent years. This trend needs to be reversed for the company to maintain its valuation. This issue has been brought up in several recent earnings calls by several analysts but management believes that it can be reversed in the long term.

* **Cybersecurity Risks:** As mentioned in the company's 10-K filing, industrial gas companies are vulnerable to cyberattacks, given their complex information technology systems.  A successful attack could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses. Management claims that it is addressing this risk through its cybersecurity risk management program (Q3 2023 earnings call) and mentioned that the company had hired a new Chief Security Officer in FY 2022 and had implemented a new Global Cybersecurity program.
