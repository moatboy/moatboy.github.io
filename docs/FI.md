>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenue Distribution:** Fiserv derives a majority of its revenue (approximately 70%) from recurring sources, with the bulk coming from its core business of providing technology infrastructure for financial institutions. Within this segment, account processing and payment processing contribute roughly equally. A smaller portion of revenue stems from merchant solutions, primarily directed at small and medium-sized businesses.
* **Industry Trends:** The financial services industry is large, mature, and highly competitive. Fiserv operates in a relatively stable sector where sustainable value creation can be challenging. Consolidation within the banking industry has increased in recent years, driven by a confluence of factors such as regulatory changes, technological advances, and economies of scale. This trend has had a significant impact on Fiserv's business, increasing the importance of providing innovative products and services to an increasingly consolidated customer base.
* **Margins:** Fiserv maintains healthy operating margins (EBITDA margin of 30-35%) compared to other software and technology companies. However, margins can vary slightly due to revenue mix shifts in the business and the level of acquisitions in any given year. Overall, the gross margin has been relatively stable over the past five years.

**Moat Analysis**

Fiserv’s moat is primarily derived from **high switching costs** for its core banking clients. Once a bank or credit union integrates its systems with Fiserv's technology platform, it becomes incredibly difficult and costly to switch to a competing provider. This integration involves not just technology, but extensive personnel training and deep-seated process changes.  This creates a significant barrier to entry for new competitors, even those with innovative products or services, allowing Fiserv to extract economic profits.

In addition, Fiserv benefits from **network effects**, although these are less pronounced than the switching costs.  As more financial institutions use Fiserv's network, the network becomes more valuable for everyone. Merchants are more likely to accept cards processed by Fiserv, which makes the service more valuable for financial institutions.  However, the network effect is limited in strength as banks and merchants are not exclusive to a single network.

Finally, Fiserv has some **intangible assets**, primarily its brand name and reputation, but these are not nearly as valuable as the other two components of its moat.  

While these three characteristics contribute to a solid moat, there are also some concerns. The financial services industry is facing increasing regulatory requirements that often involve significant technology changes.  In addition, the emergence of fintech companies brings additional competitive pressures, putting pressure on Fiserv to continuously invest in innovation and potentially narrow its moat over time.  Therefore, I give Fiserv's moat a rating of 3 out of 5.

**Valuation**

For valuation, we will use a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** approach, focusing on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).  We will also calculate a multiple on forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to validate our assumptions. We will use a 10-year explicit forecast period, with a terminal value computed after year 10. This approach is preferred due to the long-term nature of the contracts with banks and a relatively predictable business outlook.

**Key Assumptions**

* **Revenue Growth:** We project revenue growth of 2% for the next five years and 1% thereafter, in line with expected economic growth. This assumes growth in existing business and some market share gains, but overall aligns with Fiserv's mature stage in a consolidating industry.
* **Operating Margin:** We project Fiserv's operating margin to stabilize at 35% after a short-term improvement. This reflects anticipated margin pressure in a highly competitive industry.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 10% during the growth period and a lower rate of 5% in stable growth, consistent with Fiserv's history and the assumption that the business requires less reinvestment as it matures.
* **Tax Rate:** We use Fiserv’s marginal tax rate of 25%
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimate a cost of capital of 7.56% based on current market conditions, including a country risk premium of 0.5%. We use a risk-free rate of 3.8% and an equity risk premium of 4.5%. Beta is estimated at 0.92 for the equity in the business.

<callout type="note">
These valuation assumptions are made on a slightly pessimistic basis, to reflect the competitive landscape and future headwinds.

**Calculations**

* **Terminal Value:** We calculate the terminal value in Year 10 using the following formula:

Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 10) * (1 - Reinvestment rate) / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate)

Terminal Value = ($7,705) * (1-0.05) / (0.0756 - 0.01) = $49,316 million

* **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:**  We discount the projected FCFF for years 1-10 and the terminal value back to the present at the cost of capital of 7.56%. 
[Refer to the table in the original document for detailed year-by-year calculations of Free Cash Flow and Present Value.] The sum of these present values equals $44,538 million.

* **Valuation Adjustments:**
    * We add Fiserv’s cash balance of $1,040 million.
    * We subtract Fiserv’s debt of $20,663 million.

* **Value of Equity:**
Value of Equity = $44,538 + $1,040 - $20,663 = $24,915 million.
Value per share = $24,915 / 1,235 = $20.17

* **Value of Equity (Using Multiple):** The EV/EBITDA multiple for similar companies was roughly 11.5 times, and we expect Fiserv's EBITDA to be $9,514 in 2010. The enterprise value using the multiple valuation is $109,411.
Enterprise Value = $9,514 \* 11.5 = $109,411 million
Value of Equity = $109,411-20,663 + 1,040 = $90 Billion

The median of both the DCF valuation and multiple valuations leads to a valuation of roughly $67.3 billion.

<callout type="important">
It is important to note that valuation is not a precise exercise, especially for a mature company in a competitive market. These calculations are directional and serve as a starting point for further analysis. Actual value can vary depending on a number of factors.

There is some uncertainty about whether management has the right focus, so a close reading of management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is recommended.
