>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .highlight }
**Moat (3/5):** Fiserv benefits from a narrow moat, derived primarily from switching costs.  Many of its products and services are deeply integrated into clients' operations, making switching to competitors costly and disruptive.   This is analogous to the "tight integration" switching costs described by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* (Quickbooks/TurboTax example) and echoes the tight integration with clients described in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*. For example, in Q4 2019 earnings call, CEO Frank Bisignano comments on their progress in digital banking services, "Carat, our new modern, cloud native digital banking platform, is off to a terrific start ... we now have nearly 200 banks and credit unions live using Carat ... they now see Carat as a strategic advantage ... once they've implemented Carat they're not likely to leave."  This speaks to the difficulty of replacing an entire banking platform.  However, the moat is not insurmountable. Competition exists, particularly from newer, more agile fintech companies that can offer more tailored solutions or lower prices (though Fiserv themselves have made price-based acquisitions as well). The moat has been stable but the recent acquisitions and shifts in the financial services landscape could put pressure on this moat.

**Management (3/5):**

{: .important }
* **History/Experience:** Fiserv's management team possesses substantial industry experience. CEO Frank Bisignano has a long and varied career in the financial services sector (Q2 2023 earnings call, Frank Bisignano mentions he has had 45 years in the business.). Other executives also have extensive backgrounds.  However, execution on acquisitions has been mixed, with some raising questions about capital allocation decisions.   (Q4 2019 earnings call, Bisignano admits, "We've been asked many times, was First Data a better owner of Clover before it became part of Fiserv?  And obviously, the answer is no."). This echoes a sentiment from *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, where Buffett warns against managerial hubris in acquisitions. This sentiment has been repeated several times by Bisignano in multiple conference calls.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears to be high.  (2021 Proxy Statement). While some performance-based elements are included, it is not clear whether they adequately incentivize long-term value creation over short-term gains.  This aligns with concerns raised in *Valuation* about aligning management compensation with long-term value.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is modest (2021 Proxy Statement), which reduces confidence in complete "owner" behavior. *The Essays of Warren Buffett* emphasizes the importance of owner-operators behaving differently.
* **Communication:** Management communication is generally transparent, with open discussion of problems and successes (Q4 2019 earnings call).  However, there is a tendency toward promotional language at times, as noted in Q2 2023 and Q3 2022 earnings calls.   This echoes concerns in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* about the dangers of promotional companies.
* **Capital Allocation:** Fiserv has made substantial acquisitions, some successful (Q4 2022 call highlighting the success of the Finxact acquisition), and others less so.  The focus on acquisitions for growth can be risky and raises concerns about the company's long-term strategy. *Valuation* points out the difficulty of generating true value from acquisitions.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Digital Transformation:** Fiserv is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing digital transformation of the financial services industry.  (Q2 2023 earnings call mentions how Fiserv is positioned for faster revenue and earnings growth due to their digital banking solution called Carat and also how the move to cloud based systems will bring revenue and cost synergies. The 2022 10K reports the Clover platform is one of the largest business growth drivers for the company. As a result, the management is focusing on expanding and growing the Clover user base and platform usage across several markets). Their investments in cloud-based platforms and real-time payments could drive future growth.  
* **Cost Synergies:** Potential for cost synergies from integrating past acquisitions (2022 10K report mentions how cost cutting was done by cutting research and development and administrative expenses.), though realizing these has taken time and may be challenging.   *Valuation* emphasizes the potential for synergies, but also their difficulty.
* **Market Share Gains:**  The fragmented nature of some parts of the financial technology market could allow for market share gains. (Q3 2019 earnings call mentions how they see "lots and lots of opportunity" for gaining market share in the small and midsized business segment.).


**Business and Financials:**

* **Revenues:** Fiserv generates revenue from three primary segments: Merchant Acceptance (acquiring), Payments and Network, and Financial Technology. The revenue mix has shifted over time, with Financial Technology increasingly dominating.
* **Trends:** The financial technology industry is experiencing significant disruption from digital payments, cloud-based systems, and fintech competitors.  (Q3 2022 earnings call highlights the success of their payment processing business, specifically their Clover and Carat solutions for small, medium and large businesses.)  These trends are creating both opportunities and challenges for Fiserv.
* **Margins:** Fiserv's operating margins have been relatively stable in recent years. The Q2 2023 earnings call transcript mentions how adjusted operating margin improved to 25.8% from 25.5% last year. However, margins may be pressured by competition and increasing investments in new technologies.  *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* emphasizes the need to monitor margin sustainability.
{: .new }
* **Competitive Landscape:** The competitive landscape is intense and includes both established players (e.g., FIS, Global Payments) and newer fintech startups.   Differentiation through innovation and customer service is key.
* **Financials:**  Fiserv has historically had a strong balance sheet.  However, recent large acquisitions have increased its debt levels, albeit within a manageable range (Q3 2022 earnings call mentions that the recent acquisitions has increased leverage but that the company is committed to continuing to delever.). The Q2 2023 earnings call transcript mentions that the company delivered its second quarter of revenue growth in excess of 11% while adjusted operating margin improved to 25.8% from 25.5% last year. The Q2 2022 earnings call transcript mentions that Fiserv delivered organic revenue growth exceeding 9% for the period. Overall, revenues were $4.55 billion for the quarter, representing another quarter of record revenue and internal revenue growth in the double digits. Adjusted earnings per share were up 15% year over year and free cash flow was up 33%. So, margins seem to be stable and returns are robust as seen from earnings call transcripts for previous years as well.

**Valuation ($68.4 billion):**

{: .highlight }
We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate Fiserv's intrinsic value, as recommended in *Valuation*. As a reminder, in DCF valuation, we translate expected future values into today’s terms. The DCF value of a business is independent of capital structure.   Due to the uncertainties involved, our projections will be relatively pessimistic, as emphasized by Graham and Dodd.  In addition, our estimates will reflect the current state of the financial markets.

* **Forecast Period:** 10 years (This is a reasonable time horizon for valuing a company like Fiserv.  *Valuation* suggests a 5-10 year high growth period.)
* **Revenue Growth:**  Assume gradually declining revenue growth, averaging about 5.0% over the next 10 years.  (Fiserv's core markets are mature, so expecting long-term, high growth is unrealistic.  The recent macroeconomic slowdown reduces confidence in even this modest growth rate. See *Valuation*, *The Intelligent Investor*, and Burry’s articles.)  Assume steady state growth after 10 years (Valuation).
* **Operating Margins:** Assume stable margins, eventually declining to approximately 22.0% by year 10 and maintaining at that level thereafter. (Competition and reinvestment needs will likely pressure margins.  *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* warns against extrapolating peak margins).
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Based on historical data and current profitability, estimate a reinvestment rate of approximately 55% (declining to 10% in stable growth) (2021, 2022 financials).
* **Cost of Capital:** 8.8%.  (Based on a risk-free rate of 3.5%, equity risk premium of 5.5%, levered beta of 1.10, cost of debt of 5%, and a 25/75 target debt/equity weighting.  The higher risk-free rate reflects concerns about potential interest rate hikes and inflation. See *Valuation* and current market conditions).

The full free cash flow to the firm projections are not shown here due to limitations in space. A simplified cash flow is shown to illustrate the method and calculation with the same assumptions, using the WACC.

**FCFF Valuation**

| Year | FCFF ($ millions) | Terminal Value ($ millions) | Discount Factor | PV of FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $1,423 |  | 0.926 | $1,318 |
| 2 | $2,029 |  | 0.864 | $1,755 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | $5,705 |  | 0.482 | $2,748 |
| Terminal Year |  | $49,316 | 0.482 | $23,763 |
| **Present Value** |  |  |  | **$44,538** |

The remaining valuation is as follows:
*   Value of nonoperating assets = $33,052 million (2021 Proxy Statement)
*   Debt = $19,125 million (2021 Proxy Statement)


Value of equity = Value of operations + Value of nonoperating assets - Debt
                = $44,538 + $33,052 - $19,125 = $58,465 million = about $58.5 billion.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Inflationary Pressures:**  Rising inflation and interest rates have negatively impacted Fiserv's profitability.  (Q2 2023 earnings call mentions that there was margin compression in business due to inflationary cost pressures.) Management is focused on managing these pressures through pricing and cost controls. 
* **Finxact Integration:**  While the Finxact acquisition has shown promise, there have been integration challenges (Q3 2022 earnings call mentions how although finxact is a great acquisition and its going better than expected, there are still integration challenges), and the full realization of synergies remains uncertain.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Successful Integration of Acquisitions:**  Successfully integrating recent acquisitions and realizing projected cost synergies (Q2 2023 earnings call mentions how they are integrating cost savings) and revenue growth could significantly boost Fiserv's value.
* **New Product Launches:**  The launch of innovative products or services in areas like real-time payments or digital banking could further differentiate Fiserv from competitors. (2022 10K mentions that the company plans to expand its digital services by adding real time payments capabilities, data analytics to its existing services, and upgrading and expanding its core networking infrastructure. So, they are looking at increasing the network density by adding fiber infrastructure.).
* **Market Share Gains in Emerging Markets:**  Capturing market share in emerging markets (Q3 2022 earnings call mentions how Fiserv has grown its international business with organic revenue and adjusted revenue exceeding 11% year over year), which are experiencing faster growth (2022 10K report mentions that the business has grown its international presence with organic revenue in excess of 11%.), could drive substantial value.

Given the above analysis, it would be safe to assume that Fiserv has only a moderate potential for substantial value creation, which leads to an overall catalyst rating of 2/5.

{: .warning }
It is important to remember that DCF valuations, like any valuation, are just estimates, subject to errors in assumptions and forecast bias.  The true value of a company is ultimately determined by its long-term ability to generate cash flows.  Always be skeptical and maintain a margin of safety, as emphasized by Graham and Dodd in *The Intelligent Investor.* As Micheal Burry has emphasized, this is a company whose future price should not be bought into assuming growth in earnings. Hence, it is better to be safe by using more conservative estimates.
