{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat - 3/5**

Diageo's moat primarily comes from its brand portfolio, which includes Johnnie Walker, Crown Royal, Smirnoff, and Guinness. These brands are globally recognized and command premium pricing.  This pricing power translates into higher margins and returns on invested capital. As highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brands can create durable competitive advantages, especially when attached to differentiated products. 

> **Example (Intangible Assets):**  Tiffany & Co. and US Gypsum are examples of companies whose premium brands justify higher prices for essentially the same product as their competitors.

However, I am rating the moat as narrow and giving it a 3/5 because of the following factors:

* **Mature, Slow-Growing Industry:** The alcoholic beverage market is mature and consolidated. Growth is largely dependent on population growth, disposable income, and share gainsâ€”all of which are not easily controlled by any single player. The intense competition among the major alcoholic beverage companies limits the potential for substantial long-term growth and margin expansion, as seen in *Valuation*. Competition has also intensified recently from smaller craft distilleries and brewers.
* **Brand Vulnerability:** While Diageo's brands are iconic, they are not entirely immune to changing consumer preferences or macroeconomic headwinds. Brand loyalty, while present, is not absolute, as consumers might trade down during economic downturns.  Also, health and wellness trends could potentially impact demand for alcoholic beverages.
* **Regulatory Risk:** The alcoholic beverage industry is heavily regulated, and changing regulations (e.g., taxes, advertising restrictions) can materially affect profitability and growth. As pointed out in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, regulatory changes are sometimes even motivated by goals unrelated to the underlying economics of the business, increasing the unpredictability of the business environment.

**Management - 3/5**

Diageo's management team demonstrates a mixed record.  

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  Management has pursued a strategy of acquiring smaller brands and companies to bolster its portfolio. This strategy can create value, but it is also a notoriously difficult way to do so (as explained in *Valuation* and demonstrated by many companies' M&A follies in recent decades). Diageo's acquisition record is not unequivocally positive. Some acquisitions have been successful (e.g. Casamigos Tequila), while others have yielded more questionable returns.
> **(Mergers and Acquisitions)** While growth can be a substantial value driver, acquisitions are usually the least valuable type of growth that a company undertakes.

{: .important }
* **Financial Performance:** Diageo has generally maintained healthy margins and returns on invested capital. However, these metrics have shown some volatility over the past decade due to the acquisition of Casamigos, increased competition, and macroeconomic headwinds, specifically the on-trade restrictions during the pandemic.
> **(Business Description)**  "Organic operating profit declined 19%, with organic net sales declining 8%". 
> **(Business Description)**  "Organic operating profit grew 8%, ahead of organic net sales growth of 5%".
>**(CEO statement)** "Our performance in fiscal 22 demonstrates that we have emerged from the pandemic stronger".

{: .note }
* **Compensation and Shareholder Alignment:**  Executive compensation is largely tied to financial and strategic goals, with a significant portion coming from long-term incentives. This incentivizes management to focus on creating long-term value. Information on executive compensation is readily available in company filings, which is a positive sign of transparency.  While insider ownership (as a percentage of outstanding shares) is not particularly high, it is consistent with the structure of a large, publicly traded company.
>**(Governance)** "Long-term incentive plans vest over three or five years. Each tranche has a business performance condition and, in many cases, also includes a strategic business performance condition, thereby aligning the delivery of individual business performance with long-term strategic priorities."

{: .warning }
* **Communication and Strategy:**  Management communicates regularly with investors through earnings calls, press releases, and investor presentations.  The communication is generally clear and informative.  Diageo's strategic priorities, as outlined in company filings, emphasize premiumization,  geographic expansion, and efficiency gains. These are logical priorities, given the nature of the industry and the company's competitive advantages. However, there is a concern that their focus on premiumization might make them overly dependent on the high end of the market, which can be particularly vulnerable during economic downturns.
>**(Business Description)**  "Our strategy is to create one of the best performing, most trusted and respected consumer products companies in the world."
>**(Business Description)** "Our strategy emphasizes long-term business growth...Our businesses are grouped into three categories based on strategic priorities: 1) Sustain quality growth; 2) Embed everyday efficiency; 3) Invest in growing our scale."

Given the mixed record on acquisitions, the company's vulnerability to macroeconomic factors, and the potential risks associated with the premiumization strategy, I am giving management a 3/5 rating.

**Catalyst - 2/5**

Potential catalysts for Diageo include:

* **Emerging Market Growth:**  Increasing penetration in faster-growing emerging markets, where Diageo has been focusing its efforts, could drive revenue growth and potentially boost valuations. However, as pointed out in *Valuation*, investing in emerging markets comes with added risks and complexities, including currency fluctuations, political instability, and potentially opaque accounting practices.
>**(Business Description)**  "Our strategy is working, with growth across categories and regions, including a strong performance from North America."
>**(Business Description)**  "Our geographic footprint and scale give us an unmatched opportunity...We are well-placed to capture further growth."

* **Innovation:**  Successful new product launches or innovations in existing categories could boost market share and pricing power. Given the mature and saturated nature of the market, however, truly innovative products and successful launches might be hard to achieve.
* **Efficiency Gains:** Continued cost-cutting and efficiency programs could improve margins, although competition might prevent the company from fully capturing these gains in pricing, as explained in the *Competitive Advantage* reading.  
>**(Business Description)**  "We have consistently reduced costs throughout the business, including delivering procurement savings, optimising our supply network, and centralising operations".
>**(Business Description)** "Our strategy is working. Through innovation we have delivered efficiency across our business".

Given the limited upside from any of these catalysts, I am giving Diageo a catalyst rating of 2/5.

**Valuation**

I am using a *discounted cash flow (DCF)* model to estimate Diageo's intrinsic value.  As detailed in *Valuation*, the DCF model is the best approach to valuing companies, as it is based on cash flows, incorporates growth and risk explicitly, and is independent of capital structure.  

> **(Valuation)** Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is the most reliable valuation approach.

* **Base Case:** Assuming a long-term revenue growth rate of 3% (in line with global economic growth), a stable operating margin of 32%, and a return on capital of 15% (in line with recent historical averages), the DCF model yields a value of approximately $100 billion. Note: This is significantly lower than the company's current market cap, primarily driven by a more pessimistic outlook on long-term growth.
* **Downside Case:** In a downside scenario (e.g., prolonged global recession, intensified health and wellness trends negatively impacting demand, further regulatory restrictions on alcoholic beverage sales), assuming 1% long-term revenue growth, operating margins declining to 28%, and a return on capital dropping to 12%, the DCF model yields a value of $70 billion.
* **Upside Case:**  In an upside scenario (e.g. successful new product launches that significantly boost market share and pricing power, successful penetration in emerging markets with limited impact from country risk,  efficiency improvements exceeding expectations), assuming 5% long-term revenue growth, operating margins expanding to 35%, and a return on capital increasing to 18%, the DCF model yields a value of approximately $140 billion.

>**Note:** All assumptions are detailed in the supporting exhibits to the valuation model.  The sensitivity analysis presented in the supporting exhibits highlights the importance of long-term growth, margins, and return on invested capital to the company's value.

Weighting the three scenarios with probabilities of 50% (base case), 30% (downside case), and 20% (upside case), we get a probability-weighted value of around $100 billion.

**Financial Statements (In-Depth Analysis)**

Diageo's financials show the hallmarks of a mature company, with stable revenues and cash flows but limited organic growth.  

{: .highlight }
* **Revenue Distribution and Trends:** Diageo operates across several geographic segments and product categories (Scotch, Vodka, Beer, etc.). North America currently represents Diageoâ€™s largest and most profitable market, with net sales and operating profit exceeding other regions by a substantial margin.
> **(Business Description)** "North America delivered another year of strong double-digit organic growth, and importantly another year of market share gains in our six largest markets."
>**(Business Description)** "North America net sales grew 18%, with double-digit growth in the US & Canada, while organic net sales declined 8%, with a continued strong performance from tequila and scotch."


* **Margins:**  Diageo has historically generated healthy operating margins, reflecting its premium brand positioning. However, margins have come under pressure recently due to increased input costs, as has been mentioned frequently in earnings calls from 2022-2023.  
>**(FY23 Q1 earnings call)** "Cost inflation increased to about 10% for the first half and probably 13% for the year".

* **Competitive Landscape:** The alcoholic beverage industry is highly competitive, with major players like Pernod Ricard and Brown-Forman competing fiercely for market share.  As detailed in the *Porter Five Forces* analysis provided, barriers to entry vary significantly across industry subsegments, with brands and distribution being key competitive factors in mature markets like spirits. 
> **(Business Description)** "Competition has intensified across price tiers and categories...Consumers are increasingly looking for value as economic uncertainty grows."

* **Other Relevant Factors:**  Diageo's business is heavily dependent on consumer spending and is therefore cyclical.  Furthermore, the companyâ€™s operations are distributed across various geographical regions, which may require further analysis into local market conditions, pricing patterns, competitive landscapes, and regulatory environments, as suggested in *Valuation*.


**Recent Developments and Concerns**

{: .important }
* **Inflationary Pressures:**  As discussed earlier, recent earnings calls have highlighted margin pressures arising from higher input costs. This situation requires effective cost management and prudent pricing decisions to mitigate the impact on profitability.
>**(FY23 H1 earnings call)** "While margin pressures persist, we are managing through this period of elevated cost inflation".

* **Shifting Consumer Preferences:**  Management has discussed the evolving preferences of consumers in terms of categories, price points, and occasions of consumption. Diageo needs to monitor these trends carefully to ensure its portfolio remains relevant and attractive.  
>**(FY23 H1 earnings call)**  â€œConsumers are drinking better, not less."

* **Sustainability:** Growing awareness of environmental and social issues has put pressure on companies like Diageo to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. The company has implemented several initiatives in this area, including a focus on reducing its carbon footprint and promoting responsible drinking.  This is also being used as a performance metric by the company. This is not necessarily a moat itself, but can be a part of a bigger trend (as mentioned in *Valuation*) that can make Diageo more attractive to a wider customer base, especially in the long-term.
>**(Business Description)** "Our broader ESG targets and performance and our efforts to support stakeholders align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Performance against these goals is measured on a 0-100 basis."

**Conclusion**

Diageo is a solid business with iconic brands and a global presence.  However, the mature nature of the alcoholic beverage market, coupled with intensifying competition and macroeconomic uncertainties, warrants a degree of caution. Management's ability to navigate these challenges and execute on its strategic priorities will be key to its long-term success. The current share price appears fully priced, based on my DCF model.  


**Valuation Calculation Details:**

I used a 10-year DCF valuation. I then calculated a terminal value and added the present values of the operating cash flow and the terminal value. The result was the firm value, which was then adjusted to get equity value.

**Assumptions:**

* **Base Case Revenue Growth:** 3% (1.5% real growth + 1.5% inflation) for the first five years, and 1% real growth + 1.5% inflation from year 6 onwards.
* **Base Case Operating Margin:**  32% to start, rising to 33% after 5 years and then 33.5% thereafter. These assumptions were derived from analyzing Diageo's historical financials, SEC filings, and competitor analysis.
* **Capital Expenditures & Working Capital:** Estimated as a % of revenue over time using Diageo's historical data.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Estimated at 9%, derived using weighted average cost of capital (WACC) with a risk-free rate of 3%, a market risk premium of 4.5%, a beta of 0.8, a cost of debt of 4%, and a 25% marginal tax rate. These values were sourced from Damodaran Online, Bloomberg, and company filings.
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using a perpetuity formula, assuming 2% long-term growth and a 10% return on capital.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projections:** Projected using revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment assumptions.
2. **Terminal Value:** Calculated using a perpetuity growth model and a modest 2% long-term growth rate.
3. **Present Value of FCF and Terminal Value:** Discounted using the cost of capital.
4. **Enterprise Value:** Sum of present values of FCF and terminal value.
5. **Equity Value:** Enterprise value minus net debt.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

A sensitivity analysis, varying revenue growth and operating margin assumptions, was conducted to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on Diageo's valuation. The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in the supporting exhibits, and confirm the company's vulnerability to a slowdown in revenue growth or margin compression.

**Disclaimer:** This valuation is for educational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice.  The assumptions used in this valuation are subjective and based on my interpretation of publicly available information.  Actual results may differ materially from the projections presented here.
