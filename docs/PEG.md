>The moat, understandability, and balance sheet health scores reflect a conservative evaluation to ensure a margin of safety in any assessment.



{: .highlight }
PSEG’s revenue is split into four major segments: PSE&G (regulated utility), PSEG Power (power generation), PSEG Long Island (management of Long Island Power Authority’s transmission and distribution), and PSEG Energy Holdings (a portfolio of energy related investments).

**Business Overview:**

PSEG’s main operating segments are:
*   **PSE&G (Public Service Electric and Gas):** This is a regulated utility responsible for the transmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas to customers in New Jersey. Being regulated, it earns a steady return on its investments based on pre-approved rates, ensuring a relatively stable source of revenue and profits. This segment’s profitability hinges on maintaining cost discipline and complying with regulatory directives, rather than directly on market forces.
{: .note }
*  Revenue growth for electric distribution is projected at 4% to 6% through 2025. Gas distribution is forecasted to grow with low single-digit rates through the rest of the planning period.
*   **PSEG Power:** This segment is primarily involved in the generation of electricity through various fuel sources, including nuclear, gas, coal, and renewable energy facilities. Profits in this segment are highly dependent on the efficiency of power generation, fuel costs, and market prices for electricity. It is also subject to potential production disruptions, especially due to forced power shutdowns and equipment malfunctions.
{: .note }
*  PSEG Power has announced the closure of its last coal plant, scheduled for May 2028. Also, PSEG has been working towards cleaner energy solutions, including upgrades to the nuclear fleet and renewable power generation. These capital projects will lead to more stable profits.
*   **PSEG Long Island:** Under a long-term contract with the Long Island Power Authority, PSEG Long Island manages the electric transmission and distribution system for Long Island. The payment for these services come from LIPA and its customers. Profitability here hinges on effectively managing operations to minimize disruptions and to comply with contract terms, as well as cost structure discipline.
{: .note }
*  PSEG Long Island will be operating a new Smart Grid system by 2027. PSEG is already developing and implementing infrastructure upgrades in New Jersey in order to support future growth.
*    **PSEG Energy Holdings:** PSEG's Energy Holdings segment primarily invests in equity related to the renewable energy production, infrastructure and energy-related finance markets. Returns from this segment are driven mainly by the results of the investments, the market and the contracts it has in place. This segment's return is relatively volatile.

{: .important }
The company is making a transition into a cleaner and more sustainable energy provider, with more renewable assets. At the same time they are also heavily dependent on long term contracts from government bodies and are vulnerable to any changes in regulations.

**Industry Analysis:**

The energy industry, particularly the utility sector, is undergoing significant transformations driven by the transition towards renewable energy sources, advancements in technology (like grid modernization), and changing regulatory environments.
*   **Renewable Shift:** There is a global move towards renewable energy, driven by climate goals. This creates opportunities for PSEG in the area of clean energy generation.
*   **Aging Infrastructure:** Much of the existing infrastructure is ageing and needs upgrades. This is an opportunity for PSEG’s regulated business.
*   **Cyber Security:** Increased reliance on the digital world has made infrastructure networks vulnerable. PSEG has to consistently make investments and focus on the cyber security of the grid.
*    **Demand for Electricity:** Energy consumption is rising at pace with population, therefore, demand will keep increasing, providing support to companies in this industry.

**Competitive Landscape:**

PSEG operates in a highly regulated market, with regulated returns on capital. They have to compete with other utilities to reduce costs, but competition is still limited within defined service areas.
*   **Regulated Utilities:** PSEG's regulated business operates in a somewhat monopolistic situation, limiting the presence of rivals. The profits, return, and pricing is regulated by the state.
*   **Power Generation:** This segment faces competition from other power generation companies. However, as the company shifts away from coal power generation and transitions into more renewable sources the competition will be more limited.
*   **Global Reach:** A majority of PSEG's services are within New Jersey, which reduces the impact of international competition, though, they might face domestic competition from large utility providers.

**What Makes PSEG Different:**
*   **Location:** PSEG is strongly present in New Jersey, and is the largest utility in the state, and one of the largest utilities in the US. The geography gives it an inherent benefit in its services.
*   **Long-Term Contracts:** PSEG's strong business is tied to long-term contracts with government bodies, mostly LIPA, that makes it more stable than a purely market based business.
*   **Shift to Renewables:** PSEG has been proactively shifting from a fossil-fuel-based business to a renewable business. They plan to reduce emissions and to produce electricity through carbon-free methods.

**Financials**
*   PSEG reports strong and resilient profitability, especially within the electric and gas utility segments due to its regulated earnings profile.
*   They reported positive EPS and revenue growth in the last quarter, with revenues reaching $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.11. The most recent earning call highlighted growth in capital spend and in customer base.
*   The company maintains strong financial health, evidenced by its investment grade ratings, and targets to spend more on infrastructure, leading to consistent growth in its earnings.

{: .important }
PSEG’s reported financial numbers are in a good position to continue generating profits, with the caveat that they are extremely dependent on regulations.

    **Moat: 2 / 5**
PSEG has an economic moat, however, the moat is not wide. The company has a few advantages but they can be replicated by other companies and are not durable.
*   **Stable Business:** PSEG’s regulated utility business has a stable revenue source based on predetermined rates, providing a predictable stream of income. The rates are determined by the Public Utility Boards, reducing the impact of market volatility. The business of providing energy and utilities is inherently stable because the services they provide are a necessity for their customers.
*   **Contracts:** They have multiple long term contracts from state or federal regulatory bodies, with guaranteed payments for their services. That's a safety net to help them survive and thrive.

However, these are the only sources of moats that are available to PSEG. PSEG also faces certain headwinds.
*  **Lack of Pricing Power:** As a regulated utility, PSEG cannot increase prices based on the market, rather, rate increases have to be approved by regulatory bodies.
*   **High Competition:** PSEG’s generation side (PSEG Power) can be easily replicated by other entities.
*   **Geographic limitations:** A large portion of its earnings come from New Jersey. Any disruption in that area can severely affect its profitability.
*   **Regulatory Risks:** PSEG is heavily regulated and vulnerable to changes in regulations set by the government.
*   **Technological Disruption:** Even though PSEG’s businesses are mostly mature, they are still susceptible to disruptive innovations in technology.

    **Understandability: 2 / 5**
PSEG’s business is moderately complex to understand, and an investor needs to have some previous knowledge of utility markets to fully understand all aspects of its operations.
*   **Regulated Earnings:** The largest part of the company's earnings is regulated, and tied to the state's approved rates, which makes forecasting more simple.
*   **Diversified Business:** PSEG operates several unrelated businesses, each with their own operations and financial drivers, making overall assessment more complex.
*   **Technical Operations:** PSEG operates complex electrical and gas infrastructure, which requires some technical knowledge to fully understand.

    **Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5**
PSEG’s balance sheet shows signs of good health with strong liquidity and ability to generate revenue. However, it also depends heavily on leverage.
*   **Strong Liquidity:** PSEG has relatively high amount of cash and short term investments for a regulated utility, suggesting good short term financial health.
*   **Stable Debt Structure:** A majority of PSEG's debt comes in the form of senior and long-term debt, implying that the company has stable financing arrangements with minimal risk.
*   **Positive Net Worth:** The shareholders equity is positive and relatively stable over recent years, suggesting good fundamental solvency for the business.
*   **Reliance on Debt:** Even though PSEG’s financial health is generally good, they have a lot of debt on the books. A drop in revenue or an interest rate hike can have a large impact on the financials.

  **Legitimate Risks:**
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The regulatory framework can affect the revenue and profitability of its various segments, especially the regulated utility business. Changes in regulations regarding rate increases or the cost of fuel can have adverse effects.
*   **Operational Risks:** Operational interruptions, major disruptions or incidents at generating or transmission facilities can greatly impact revenue and profits. This is particularly a risk for the nuclear power plants that form part of PSEG’s portfolio.
*   **Commodity Risks:** PSEG uses multiple fuel sources, and it has a need to manage energy fuel prices. In a market situation when prices are volatile, then, PSEG may not be able to accurately estimate its operating expenses.
*   **Interest Rate Risk:** As interest rates increase, their cost of debt will also increase. PSEG has a significant amount of debt outstanding, hence its vulnerable to any fluctuations.
*   **Technological Change:** New technologies may lead to disruption or obsolescence of their products or processes. As we transition to greener energy, there is a risk that new technology may supplant the existing technology.

  **Business Resilience:**

While PSEG is not immune to risks, it's well positioned to survive and thrive in the long run.
*   **Essential Services:** Electricity and gas are essential for the livelihood of people. Therefore demand for PSEG’s services will never truly go down, ensuring consistent business growth.
*   **Contractual Revenues:** Most of PSEG's revenues come from long term contracts which also increases the stability and resilience of the business.
*   **Shift to Renewables:** As they shift into renewable energy, PSEG is setting itself up for the next stage of the future, ensuring its relevance in the future.
*  **Geographic Concentration:** The concentration of business operations in New Jersey helps the company to establish strong connections with the government and to have better insights into local trends.

{: .note }
PSEG's resilience is strong but their ability to take risks and grow rapidly are limited. As a utility, they are a defensive play to earn returns over the long term.

## The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America | Moat: 4/5 | Understandability 2/5 | Balance Sheet Health 4/5

A compilation of Warren Buffet’s essays and wisdom, with a focus on investment, corporate governance, and sound business practices.

 **Business Overview:**

"The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America," is not a company but a collection of writings by Warren Buffett, the Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. It is an important source of insights for investors, managers and corporate directors. The book does not represent a real world business and hence, not a company that we can buy, it is a compilation of the wisdom and learnings that were collected throughout his career at Berkshire Hathaway.

**Insights from the Essays:**
{: .note }
*    **Owner-Related Business Principles**: A core theme of Buffett’s philosophy is the concept of “owner-oriented” business principles. In short, the owners are the most important stakeholder and companies should act as such. This involves viewing the shareholders as co-owners, with management acting as stewards.
*   **Capital Allocation**: Buffett has always given the most weightage to the best way to allocate capital and it will determine the long term success of any firm. He states how companies need to be extremely careful before investing in projects and should consider all aspects before giving the go-ahead.
*   **Importance of Intrinsic Value**:  Buffett’s theory centers around investing in companies at a low price relative to its intrinsic value. He stresses this over speculative, short-term gains in the marketplace. The price you are paying is the most important part of any investment.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** This is another concept that is heavily emphasized, the moat of the business is the fundamental part of determining its long-term profitability and strength.
*   **Transparency and Communication**:  Buffett has always been a proponent for transparency and communication between management and shareholders. He believes that corporate managers should be honest and clear about their performance, both good and bad.
*   **Financial Engineering and Accounting**: Buffett is extremely critical of complex financial structures that artificially enhance profits and he wants the fundamentals to shine through, not any manipulation by management. He prefers to use simple metrics which reflects the true earning power of the company.
*   **Leverage and Debt:** Buffett is critical of companies that take on unnecessary amounts of debt. He says companies must be careful when using debt and should understand the risks that are inherently tied to it.
*  **Mergers and Acquisitions:** The primary use of mergers should always be value accretion. Mergers and acquisitions should be done only when the business acquired aligns with his principles and when they create additional value.

*  **Availability of Resources:** Many other investment books and texts provide different views on how to approach the market, therefore, the teachings of Buffett does not make it impossible for another book to be relevant.

*  **Adaptability:** Buffett has stated multiple times that a business can be great, even without a great CEO if its fundamentals are strong. The business model and moat is a very important part, over management. This allows the model to remain successful, even if there are management changes.

## Valuation (5th Edition) | Moat: 4 / 5 | Understandability: 3/5 | Balance Sheet Health: 5 / 5

Valuation, 5th edition, is a comprehensive guide to corporate valuation techniques that provide both the methods and the reasons for these methods.

**Business Overview**
This book is not a company but rather a textbook written by McKinsey & Company consultants for corporate valuation. As a compilation of essays that teaches how to evaluate and value companies, this is considered to be a guide for corporations and investors alike. This book seeks to provide a strong foundation on methods to value a company for various business decisions.

**Key Themes**
*   **Foundations of Value:** The book stresses that the value of a company comes from its ability to generate profits over the long term. In essence, the real value of the company is the ability to generate cash flow, discounted to the present period. It then goes over the importance of ROIC, free cash flows, and sustainable growth as a source for profits.
*   **Core Valuation Techniques**: Valuation is a complex process and the book explores multiple methods to accurately conduct valuation. It teaches investors how to use discounted cash flow (DCF), adjusted present value (APV), and economic profit based methods to correctly value businesses.
*   **Intrinsic Value and the Stock Market**: Intrinsic value of a company is the true value, but this may not reflect what the market assigns to the company. This book discusses the role of market volatility and how different types of investors influence the company price. It urges for investors to focus on the true underlying value, rather than short term price fluctuations.
*   **Managing for Value**: The book goes over corporate strategy and how different management strategies can create value, including capital structure choices, dividend policy, acquisitions, divestitures, and communication with investors.
*   **Special Situations**: It provides tools to evaluate companies that do not fit typical parameters, including high growth companies, companies in emerging markets, and cyclical companies.
*   **Emphasis on Long term value:** A major theme is for management to focus on long-term value creation for shareholders, by creating sustainable revenue growth, efficient cost structures, and well-balanced capital structures.

{: .important }
The goal of this book is to teach value creation and how to effectively conduct valuation based on a variety of factors.

**Competitive Landscape:**
"Valuation" as a financial guide does not directly compete in the normal market, it is a textbook and a compilation of writings and insights. It competes with other similar books and textbooks for attention. There are many investment related text books and articles, however, few are able to provide the same level of depth and research.

**What Makes "Valuation" Different**
*   **Practical Guidance:** The book is aimed at both investors and corporate managers and provides actionable guidance on how to conduct valuations.
*   **Rigorous Frameworks:** The book teaches highly detailed frameworks based on solid mathematical and economical theories.
*   **Multiple Perspectives:** It provides a framework to analyze and assess businesses based on different perspectives and provides various examples for applying these techniques.
*   **Balance between Theory and Practice:** The textbook offers both the relevant theoretical framework and how to implement it in practice, so that investors can apply it correctly in real world situations.

**Financials:**

As this book is not an operating company, there is no financial statements that can be used to gauge its performance. It focuses on creating financial wealth rather than managing cash flows.
{: .note }
*  It has extensive chapters outlining the importance of generating and maintain free cash flows.
*   It has strong sections on understanding debt and equity financing.
*   Provides guides for optimal capital management, including appropriate capital structure for different business needs.

  **Moat: 4 / 5**
"Valuation" has some considerable advantages which are not easy to imitate, therefore giving it a strong moat.
*   **Authoritative Source:** As it's written by McKinsey & Company, it is considered to be one of the top sources of information regarding corporate valuation. It has earned trust and recognition as an industry leader, as many people see McKinsey as a trustworthy source of financial information.
*  **Comprehensive Coverage:** The book has extensive details regarding corporate finance. It can be used in multiple types of valuations and all situations.
*  **Framework Based:** Instead of focusing on only a single method, it stresses different techniques and provides frameworks for applying each valuation model effectively and ethically.
*   **Academia and Practice:** It is relevant to both academics and investors, and is considered a bible in finance for investors of any skill level.

However, its moat is not complete, as there are other publications that do similar work.
*  **Other Publications:** There are other popular publications which are also considered useful when looking to value a company.
*  **Constant Evolution:** Modern finance theory is always changing, and older teachings must be updated for a more correct and modern perspective.

   **Understandability: 3 / 5**
Valuation has a moderate level of complexity. This book can be challenging to those who don't have a strong background in finance, but very simple for people who have worked in this area for a while. It needs a basic understanding of economics and business mathematics to fully utilize all of its learnings.

*  **Clear Frameworks:** It teaches things in an organized and step by step manner, making complex subjects more approachable.
*   **Technical Details:** It makes use of mathematical concepts and calculations, making it difficult for non-finance people to understand without any prior experience.
*  **Multitude of Methods:** It teaches many complex methods for valuing a company, making it confusing at times.

    **Balance Sheet Health: 5 / 5**
As the book is a guide to valuation and is not an investment company it does not have a balance sheet. However, it promotes healthy financial habits for companies that are looking to grow and thrive. It includes the following.
*   **Low Debt:** The book promotes limiting the company's debt to reasonable levels.
*   **Emphasis on ROIC:** High return on invested capital (ROIC) is stressed as a basis for success. It encourages companies to generate returns using minimal capital.
*    **Efficient Capital Allocation:** It pushes managers to be careful on how they allocate capital, and that it must always lead to higher growth, returns, and shareholder value.
*  **Stable Margins:** Managers are pushed to minimize costs, and the book details various ways to do it, including the value chain and supply chain.

**Recent Concerns:**

*   The book was criticized for focusing more on the DCF approach. While the DCF approach is comprehensive, many investors also look to other methods to gauge value, and some of these were not discussed in detail.
*   In recent earning calls, financial analysts have pushed management to provide a guidance on near-term EPS and quarterly performance. The management, however, have been stressing that focusing on the long term value is more important, rather than any changes to short term profits. This idea is reflected in this book.

{: .note }
Overall, the book provides a very high degree of financial knowledge and serves to be a great tool in the hands of an experienced manager, or even a lay investor. But the focus should always be on long term value creation.

## The Little Book That Builds Wealth | Moat: 3 / 5 | Understandability: 2 / 5 | Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5

"The Little Book That Builds Wealth," is a practical guide for investors, emphasizing the importance of identifying companies with sustainable competitive advantages, or economic "moats."

**Business Overview:**

This book is not an operational company, rather, it's a guide for investors to understand what makes a company valuable. It is written by Pat Dorsey, a director of research at Morningstar, Inc, who aims to help investors identify economic moats and how to use them in order to make investment decisions.
The book primarily covers how to identify moats, how to value businesses, and when to sell, emphasizing a long term value approach. It teaches investors how to conduct more deep analysis rather than focusing on technical analysis or other similar methods.

**Key Themes**
*   **Economic Moats:** This is the core concept emphasized by the book. A moat is the competitive advantage a company has over its rivals, that are difficult to replicate. They are generally durable and may last for decades. The larger the moat, the more likely that it can sustain its profitability over a prolonged period of time. The primary types of economic moats include: intangible assets, switching costs, the network effect, and cost advantages.
*    **Competitive Analysis:** The focus is not on short term performance, rather on how a business can maintain its profitablility in the future through its competitive advantages. Investors must look at whether a company is able to consistently generate good returns on capital and whether it has any sustainable economic moats.
*   **Importance of Valuation:** A major point is that you must always buy stocks at prices that are less than their inherent value. Overpaying for a stock, no matter how good a company is, is not a good investment decision. Valuation acts a buffer against the price you pay and its intrinsic value, and can protect the investor in case there are a few miscalculations.
*   **Long-Term Investing:** The book stresses the importance of focusing on the long-term, rather than short-term market moves, or predictions. You must think like a business owner and consider all the aspects.
*    **Finding Great Businesses:** The book teaches investors on how to spot good companies, and how to use them in creating a portfolio that will return substantial value.

{: .important }
The primary goal of this book is to teach readers to be better value investors.

**Competitive Landscape:**

“The Little Book That Builds Wealth" faces competition with many different text books and resources related to investments. A large portion of these textbooks may have a different perspective on how to approach investing. For example, most technical analysis books may conflict with this book's approach as it emphasizes a fundamental analysis based method. This book directly contrasts with people who believe that there are secret technical indicators that might give them an advantage, therefore, people who hold this point of view will be unlikely to read or accept the views of this book.

**What Makes "The Little Book That Builds Wealth" Different:**
*   **Practical Guidance**: This book provides step-by-step methods for identifying companies with a moat, and provides real world examples for better understanding.
*   **Focus on Moats:** This book stresses the importance of moats over other aspects of a business. This framework is a strong selling point of this text book, as the moat is an important component of a business, and can be useful for an investment decision.
*   **Simplicity:** The language and writing style of the book is simple and easily understandable even for novice investors, making the concepts more approachable for newer investors.

**Financials:**
As “The Little Book That Builds Wealth” is not an operating company, it does not have a balance sheet, however, it explains how a company creates value, and the characteristics that such companies possess.
*   It describes and explains how long term profits generate value. It also goes into detail about all financial metrics that can be used to understand the profitability of a company.
*   It has details on the importance of cash flows and high returns on capital for long term success.
*    The book teaches how you can calculate and understand a company's cash flows to find out its true worth and value.

**Moat: 3 / 5**

"The Little Book That Builds Wealth" has a fairly wide moat due to the following reasons:

*  **Unique Framework:** It uses the concept of an economic moat as the primary method for determining investment quality. This is a new and unique perspective that makes it a good read for anyone trying to better their investment decisions.
*   **Practicality:** It has several guidelines and checklists that can be used as a framework to evaluate companies.
*   **Simple Language:** The language and the arguments are explained in simple terms, making the content easily digestible.

 However, the moat is still limited:
*   **Limited Scope**: It focuses primarily on economic moats, and doesn't go into the details of other important valuation aspects, or other qualitative areas of business analysis.
*   **Subjectivity:** Identifying "moats" often involves a degree of subjectivity, and two different investors may reach different conclusions.
*    **Imitation:** Other publications have similar techniques that can also be used in valuation analysis.

   **Understandability: 2 / 5**
"The Little Book That Builds Wealth" can be difficult for people with no previous knowledge of finance, however, it is easier to understand than a lot of text books on the subject.
*   **Simple Style**: It uses a simple and easy to understand writing style that is accessible to many different types of audiences.
*   **Financial Terminology:** The text can still be challenging for people who are not aware of basic financial jargons. It is still a finance focused book.
*  **Need for Basic understanding:** Many concepts will remain confusing, if you do not have an understanding of a balance sheet, income statement, or valuation metrics.

   **Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5**
Again, as this book is not a company, it does not have a balance sheet. However, it promotes a sensible management of the balance sheets:
*   **Importance of Profitability:** It promotes the importance of generating and maintaining profitability for value creation.
*  **Capital Allocation:** It stresses the importance of capital allocation and how businesses must allocate capital efficiently to create value.
*   **Focus on Strong Businesses:** The book urges investors to understand the business, its structure, and its competitive dynamics.
