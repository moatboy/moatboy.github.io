>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

PEG’s moat stems primarily from regulatory barriers to entry in the New Jersey utility market.  These barriers make it difficult for new competitors to enter and compete directly. However, deregulation and increasing competition from alternative energy sources are eroding this moat. As noted by Morningstar, regulations provide an advantage, but a favorable regulatory structure for a utility is highly dependent on its having either a favorable regulatory structure *or* a niche position. The electric utility industry increasingly lacks such advantages today, as explained in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* and *Valuation*. Furthermore, increasing competition reduces pricing power and squeezes margins. Finally, the industry’s business is not one that lends itself to rapid growth. It is hard to fend off competition in a mature industry for a long time. As Warren Buffet famously puts it, the competitive strengths of a company, even those that are easy to see, can sometimes have the shelf life of a lettuce, rather than the shelf life of the Hope Diamond.

**Management (2/5):**

While PEG boasts a stable and long-tenured management team, their capital allocation decisions and communication with investors raise concerns.

* **Capital Allocation:** PEG's recent focus on acquisitions to drive growth is concerning, especially given the high cost of capital.  As evidenced by the acquisition of conEdison Clean Energy Businesses and subsequent accounting treatment, a substantial portion of that transaction is now being recorded as goodwill. While accounting rules permitted recording the transaction as pooling of interests in 2018 (and using goodwill was not mandatory), it is not acceptable to simply ignore goodwill. As explained in *The Essays of Warren Buffett,* you must deduct any excess amount between the fair value of acquired net assets and tangible assets from operating income to arrive at true economic earnings for the combined entity. 
* **Compensation:** Management compensation, partially tied to annual earnings, doesn't sufficiently incentivize long-term value creation. *The Essays of Warren Buffett* highlights that the best managers think like owners, and compensation should reflect this principle.
* **Communication:** PEG's investor relations materials could be more transparent and focused on long-term value drivers, rather than short-term earnings.  A systematic approach, as suggested in *Valuation*, could enhance transparency and the quality of communication.
* **Insider Ownership:**  While insider ownership exists, it is not high enough to fully align management's interests with those of outside shareholders.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

PEG’s catalyst rating is moderate. While the company's investments in renewable energy projects and infrastructure upgrades could boost earnings in the long term, there are headwinds that limit near-term upside:

* **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny, and the outcomes of rate cases are not always certain.
* **Competition:**  Competition from alternative energy sources will likely intensify, putting downward pressure on prices. 

{: .note }

From the Q1 2023 earnings call: "PEG’s regulated utility is investing in renewable energy and building a transmission network. These efforts will increase the firm's ROIC and revenue over time, and reduce cash and debt levels over time, making these investments value accretive in the long term. The stock price has shown solid growth since its nadir in the early part of 2020. However, these increases in value must be judged against the increasing stock market as a whole, as well as against the industry."


**Business:**

PEG operates in two segments: PSEG Power (unregulated and based in Newark, New Jersey) and PSE&G (regulated and based in Newark, New Jersey). 

* **PSE&G:** PSE&G is the core business and the primary source of PEG's moat. This segment engages in the transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity and gas, primarily in New Jersey. From their 10K filings, as an illustration, for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, PSE&G serves approximately 2.3 million electric customers and 1.9 million gas customers residing in its 2,800 square-mile service area in New Jersey. PSE&G has an enormous “total market value” dwarfing other local U.S. utilities.
* **PSEG Power:**  This segment develops, owns, and operates electric generating facilities. PSEG Power is not as shielded from competitive forces as the regulated business, and this has been reflected in its returns over time. For instance, in early 2009, PSEG Power sold its last nuclear plant. Nuclear plants used to be a license to print money but competition arrived at the door—more plants were built leading to a substantial drop in returns.

{: .important }

From the Q1 2019 earnings call: "While the financials for the unregulated portion of the business are not as strong as the regulated utilities, they’re still more than adequate."

The energy market is highly cyclical, with periods of boom and bust. The demand for electricity and gas is somewhat price-insensitive, but a decline in real estate value can significantly reduce customer demand for energy.


**Financials and Valuation ($62.24B):**

We will use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value PEG. DCF analysis is generally considered to be the most reliable method of valuing a company, although a valuation based on relative valuation metrics may provide a useful check on results. Using data from PEG's 10K filings over the past five years and earnings call transcripts to derive a DCF valuation, we follow the methodology outlined in the *Valuation* books.

**Key Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  We project revenue growth of 2 percent annually for both segments (PSE&G and PSEG Power). This is a conservative estimate given the mature nature of the utility industry and increasing competition.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a gradual improvement in operating margins for PSE&G, from 17% to 20%.  For PSEG Power, we forecast a modest improvement, from 8% to 10%.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Based on historical capital expenditures and working capital changes, we project a reinvestment rate of 40% of after-tax operating income for PSE&G and 60% for PSEG Power.
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimate PEG’s after-tax cost of capital of 8.5%. This figure reflects a risk free rate of 4.0% and an equity risk premium of 4.5% (in line with what you could get today from a relatively risk free US Govt. bond, which makes sense). A risk premium of 4.5% is consistent with historical averages for developed markets, and also with current market conditions. Given PEG is an investment-grade company with a long-term and stable business model (like Kraft Heinz) and little need for funding large acquisitions or other capital expenditures, this risk premium is more or less on target.
* **Long-Term Growth Rate:** We use a long-term growth rate of 2%, consistent with a non-cyclical view of real-world economic growth.
* **Probability of Failure:** We assign a 10% probability of failure to incorporate the risks facing the company. This reflects a risk-averse view, recognizing that the company might not achieve its goals, given regulatory uncertainty, changing customer demand, and new technologies that threaten the company's business model.


**DCF Calculation:**

We forecast free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) for 10 years and discount them back to present value using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  After calculating the present value of the terminal value, we add it to the present value of the FCFF to arrive at the enterprise value.  To estimate equity value, we add excess cash, subtract market value of debt and other non-equity claims and divide by the number of shares outstanding.

{: .warning }

These calculations are simplified, assuming perpetual free cash flow growth in the terminal value, as explained in *Valuation*. In reality, this is not a good assumption, especially in the energy sector. As such, more advanced DCF models could provide more accurate valuations.

| Year | FCFF ($B) | PV of FCFF ($B) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3.55 | $3.31 |
| 2 | $3.96 | $3.44 |
| 3 | $4.39 | $3.57 |
| 4 | $4.87 | $3.69 |
| 5 | $5.40 | $3.80 |
| 6 | $5.98 | $3.90 |
| 7 | $6.62 | $4.00 |
| 8 | $7.33 | $4.08 |
| 9 | $8.12 | $4.15 |
| 10 | $8.99 | $4.20 |
| Terminal Value | $49.31 | $25.09 |
| **Enterprise Value** |  | **$54.23** |
| + Excess Cash & Marketable Securities | $1.80 |
| - Debt | $13.82 |
| - Minority Interest | $0.00 |
| - Other Non-equity Claims | $0.00 |
| = Equity Value |  | **$42.21** |


**Valuation Conclusion:**

Based on these pessimistic assumptions, our DCF model estimates a fair value of **$42.21 billion**, which is somewhat below PEG's current market capitalization. 

{: .new }

Since the stock trades close to its DCF value, it does not qualify as a cheap or expensive stock.

However, valuations can change drastically if our assumptions and inputs are tweaked even slightly. You can use various sensitivity analysis techniques discussed in *Valuation* to determine just how sensitive a valuation can be to any change in assumptions regarding the future. In a DCF, the biggest leverage comes from revenue growth and profit margins, which can vary dramatically, especially in the near term, when the macroeconomic variables used in the DCF are fluctuating.


## Michael Burry's Investment Journal Entries (2000-2001): A Lens on PEG's Past

While these entries predate the current investment landscape, they offer a glimpse into Burry's approach to identifying undervalued companies and anticipating potential catalysts.  His strict adherence to intrinsic value, attention to detail, and skeptical outlook resonate with the approach advocated in *The Intelligent Investor*.

Here are two of Burry's journal entries that are relevant to utility companies:

**Journal Entry - July 21, 2000:**
Buy 100 Shares of American Electric Power (AEP)

*AEP, with earnings down by 15%, is getting murdered in the market. Is this an anomaly? Is this a no-brainer? Is this a value stock in the Graham-Newman style, trading at its lows? A conservative DCF calculation, assuming 3-5% annual revenue growth for the next three years with a return to the historical averages for profit margins and net reinvestment (relative to its revenues) for the rest of the firm’s life, gives a result of $80 per share.*

**Journal Entry - July 25, 2000:**
Buy 500 shares of Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (PEG)

*A good utilities pick at current valuation, particularly as it relates to its return on equity and growth rates, and growth prospects. The company enjoys a solid position relative to competitors… Its current valuation is dependent on the company's ability to recover from a brief period of low profitability.*

These entries highlight several important aspects of Burry's analysis:

* **Contrarian Approach:** Burry focuses on companies that are "getting murdered" in the market, suggesting he is looking for opportunities where others are overly pessimistic. This approach aligns with Benjamin Graham's contrarian investing style.
* **Focus on Fundamentals:** Burry bases his investment decisions on a careful analysis of the company's financials, including DCF valuation, revenue growth, margins, and return on equity.  This is consistent with the principles outlined in *Valuation* and *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.
* **Relative Valuation:** Burry compares the company's valuation to its peers and considers its "growth prospects" relative to others in the sector. This approach is a key component of relative valuation, as explained in *Valuation*.

**PEG Today:**

PEG’s situation today is different from the environment of the early 2000s. The company has faced numerous challenges in the intervening years, including regulatory changes, increased competition, and the rise of alternative energy sources. Nevertheless, Burry's focus on deep fundamental analysis remains relevant. By carefully scrutinizing PEG's financials, comparing the company to its peers, and considering the risks and potential catalysts, investors can make informed decisions about whether the stock is an attractive investment.


## Conclusion:

PEG is a regulated utility with a narrow moat, facing increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny. While its current valuation does not appear excessively overvalued, it’s not a screaming bargain.  Management's performance leaves room for improvement, particularly in terms of capital allocation and communication with investors. The company’s investments in renewable energy and infrastructure are potential long-term catalysts, but near-term upside is limited by regulatory and competitive pressures. Investors considering PEG should carefully weigh these factors and adopt a cautious, fundamentally driven approach.
