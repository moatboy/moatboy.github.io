*   **Revenues:**
    *   **Management Fees:** These are relatively stable and recurring, based on a percentage of the assets under management.

**Financial Analysis:**
{: .important }

Recent financial results from the company's 6-K filings and earnings calls show mixed performance with some challenges, as well as several positive aspects of their business.

*  **Q4 2022 Earnings Call:**
  *   AUM remained stable year-over-year, but significant currency devaluations had a negative impact on total AUM when translated to USD. However, there was an increase in total AUM in local currency.
  *   Capital raising in the last year was primarily for infrastructure projects in Brazil and Chile, and credit products in Mexico and Brazil. The company noted that investor allocations continue to show a preference for credit strategies.
  *   Fee-Related Earnings (FRE) is under pressure on a year-over-year basis and for the full year 2022, which the company mainly attributes to the decline in fees for its public equities. However, the FRE margin was quite strong, particularly in Private Equity, Credit, Infrastructure and Real Estate.
  *   Management noted an increase in deployment activity, and they were deploying to higher-return assets.
  *   The firm's strategic plan to focus on growth in areas where it sees strong potential for returns was discussed.

**Moat Rating: 2 / 5**
Patria's moat is **narrow** rather than wide. Here's why:

*  **Local Expertise and Relationships:** The company's deep local knowledge and existing relationships do create a notable barrier to entry for new competitors, especially international firms without established connections in Latin America, however, these advantages are not insurmountable and can be copied over a longer period of time.
*   **Brand Reputation:** Patria's long-standing operations and brand recognition give it a slight advantage in attracting investors. However, brand strength alone doesn't create an incredibly difficult barrier for competition.
*   **Switching Costs:**  While there may be some costs associated with switching from a fund to another, the industry is not characterized by high switching costs. Investors are generally able to move between funds rather quickly.
*   **Scalability:** Although the firm has grown rapidly over the last decade, there is no real evidence that they can scale rapidly or reach the dominance they need to have an edge over other peers.
*   **Network Effects**: Some businesses, such as tech platforms, benefit significantly from network effects. However, companies like Patria do not have a similar dynamic that strongly reinforces itself as more investors and capital is brought in.

**Risks to the Moat & Business Resilience:**
{: .warning }

While Patria is a well-positioned company, several factors may present challenges:
*   **Economic Downturn:** A significant economic downturn in Latin America could reduce fundraising for the company, thus lowering their performance and management fees.
*  **Political Instability:** The political climate of Latin America can sometimes be unpredictable and may negatively impact financial conditions, investor sentiment, or regulation.
*   **Currency Fluctuations:** Currency fluctuations can negatively affect revenue when they are reported in USD terms, even if the company is generating increasing profits in local currency.
*   **Competition:** As the alternative investment market grows in popularity, new entrants could challenge existing players like Patria.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** New and changing regulations could significantly impact their operations.

{: .important }

**Business Resilience**
*   **Diversified Investment Strategies:** Patria's portfolio is composed of diverse businesses across different asset classes that partially offset the risk from some negative impacts in any one area.
*   **Strong Client Base:** Their long-term client relationships may offer a degree of resilience during market downturns.
*   **Stable Management Fees:** A larger portion of their revenues come from management fees, which tend to be stable during various market conditions. This provides the firm with some level of downside protection.
*   **Experience:** The company has seen many market booms and busts and has probably learned how to navigate different periods, providing them a solid foundation for resilience.
*  **Focus on Private Assets**: With the expected increase in investments into alternative private assets, Patria is well positioned to benefit from tailwinds that favour its strategy.

**Understandability: 4 / 5**
The business model is relatively straightforward: a company that manages multiple funds and charges management and performance fees. However, there are a few factors that make it slightly complex. These are:

*   **Complex Fee Structures:** The various types of fee arrangements may be difficult for investors to fully understand, making the business difficult to fully grasp.
*   **Diverse Asset Classes:** Understanding the economics and risks of Private Equity, Infrastructure, Credit, and Real Estate all at once can be challenging.
*   **Global Factors:** It is difficult to understand the impact of exchange rates and overall financial markets and economic conditions on the company's financials.
*  **The company has a "private equity" feel to it, even though it is publicly traded. It might not be an easy company to fully understand at first glance.**

**Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5**
Patria exhibits solid financial health overall.

*   **Liquidity:** There is a notable level of cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets on hand that helps them operate the business comfortably, and meet their short-term liabilities.
*   **Leverage:** The company employs moderate amounts of debt to leverage its capital, but debt levels are manageable and do not imply any sort of default risk.
*  **Equity:** Equity levels are sound, providing a cushion against any market downturn. They have demonstrated growth over time.
*    **Profitability**: The company has been consistently profitable for the past several years. The overall profitability has been satisfactory.
* **Cash Flow:** A large percentage of the income generated by the company is cash that they are able to freely use to reinvest in operations. Their free cash flow is in a favorable condition.
*  **Overall**: Patria exhibits strong solvency metrics.

This combination of solid fundamentals, a diverse portfolio and strong client relationships implies that they have solid financial health.
