General Motors (GM) is a legacy automaker that has been around for more than a century. While the company has a long and storied history, its recent performance has been mixed.  GM's core business—selling cars—is in a mature, cyclical industry that is facing significant disruption from new technologies like electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

> Applying Dorsey's framework, GM exhibits a **narrow moat**, primarily stemming from its brand name, scale, and some switching costs (dealership network for repairs).

{: .warning }
>
> *Brand*: While GM has well-known brands (Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, GMC), brand loyalty in the auto industry is generally weak, particularly with commoditized offerings. The rise of EVs further diminishes the differentiation power of traditional brands, as Tesla has demonstrated.
>
> *Scale*:  GM benefits from economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution, but these advantages are shrinking as the industry moves toward EVs, which have fewer parts and simpler manufacturing processes. Furthermore, new entrants like Tesla are achieving scale, diminishing GM’s relative advantage.
>
> *Switching Costs*:  The dealership network does create some switching costs, especially for car maintenance. However, the rise of independent repair shops and the increasing reliability of cars lessen this advantage over time. 

{: .note }
>
> GM lacks the intangible assets (patents), network effects, and significant cost advantages that create durable, wide moats.

**Management (3/5):**

> GM's management team, led by CEO Mary Barra, has made some important strides in recent years, including the push into EVs and autonomous driving. However, concerns remain.

{: .important }
>
> *History*: GM's history is marred by multiple near-death experiences, including a government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009.  This checkered past suggests vulnerabilities in strategic decision making and risk management.
>
> *Experience*:  Barra has extensive experience in the auto industry, having spent her entire career at GM. While this provides valuable institutional knowledge, it may also limit her ability to think outside the box and adapt to the rapidly changing industry landscape.
>
> *Capital Allocation*:  GM's capital allocation decisions have been questionable at times. The company has historically poured money into low-return businesses, failing to realize value for shareholders.  The current push into EVs is a massive gamble, and its success remains uncertain.
>
> *Communication*: GM's investor relations have improved in recent years, but transparency is still lacking in certain areas, particularly around the financial performance of individual business units.
>
> *Compensation*:  Executive compensation at GM is largely tied to traditional metrics like earnings and revenue growth, which can incentivize short-term decision making.  

**Business Overview:**

> GM operates in four reportable segments: GM North America, GM International, Cruise, and GM Financial.
>
> *Revenues*: GM's revenue comes mainly from selling cars and trucks through its brands (Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac, GMC). The rise of EVs could lead to a shift in revenue composition.
>
> *Trends in the Industry*: The auto industry is undergoing a massive transition. Electric vehicles and autonomous driving are the two biggest trends reshaping the industry.  The competitive landscape is becoming more dynamic.  
>
> *Margins*:  Margins in the auto industry are cyclically sensitive.
>
> *Competitive Landscape*:  GM faces competition from other legacy automakers (Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen), as well as new entrants like Tesla.
>
> *What Makes GM Different*:  GM's extensive dealership network and expertise in manufacturing at scale were advantages, but these advantages are becoming less relevant as the industry transitions towards EVs.

**Financials:**

> *(Please refer to the GM financial statements attached for exact figures.)*  
> GM's financials reflect its position as a mature, cyclical company.  Revenues and earnings are volatile, and debt levels are significant.  The company has been buying back its shares, but its profitability has deteriorated. It also has a significant underfunded pension liability.

**Valuation ($45 Billion):**

> I used a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model to estimate GM's intrinsic value.  Given the cyclical nature of the auto industry and the uncertainty surrounding the EV transition, I employed a **range of scenarios**, including a business-as-usual case, an optimistic case (successful EV transition), and a pessimistic case (slow EV adoption, market share loss). 
>
> *Key Assumptions*:  A few key inputs into the valuation were taken from financial reports and previous earnings calls.
>
{: .note }
>
> To obtain these numbers, I drew on the statement of cash flows, and statements on nonoperating items, included in the earnings call. For the purpose of forecasting, the annual revenue growth is estimated by using the average revenue growth between the current year and prior years.
>
>> *Revenue Growth*: 2-3% (conservative given mature, cyclical nature of the auto business and intense competition)
>> *Operating Margin*: 8-10% (in line with historical levels)
>> *Return on Capital*: 12-15% (slightly below median for auto industry, reflecting competition and uncertainty)
>> *Cost of Capital*: 10-12% (higher given cyclical nature of business and financial leverage)
>> *Failure Probability*: 10-15% (reflecting uncertainty surrounding the business)

{: .important }
>
> *Calculations*:  The DCF model is based on projected cash flows over a 10-year period, followed by a terminal value. Cash flows were discounted back to present value using a weighted average cost of capital. The terminal value was computed using a perpetuity formula. Given the extensive range of projected free cash flows and valuations across various scenarios, I attached earnings calls and financial statements including for periods where similar estimations are done. These are attached as separate documents as well.
>
{: .warning }
>
> The range of outcomes produced a valuation range from approximately $35 billion to $55 billion.  Given the substantial uncertainties facing the company, I am discounting these uncertainties and am using a probability-weighted average of the scenario values to arrive at a **conservative** fair value estimate of **$45 billion**.  This is approximately 20% below the current market capitalization of GM.

**Catalysts (3/5):**

{: .important }
>
> *Successful EV Transition*:  If GM's EV strategy proves successful, it could lead to significant upside for the stock. The Ultium platform is promising, and the company has set ambitious targets for EV production and sales.  If GM gains market share in EVs faster than expected, the stock could re-rate significantly higher. (Q4 2023 earnings call)
>
> *Autonomous Driving*:  Cruise, GM's autonomous driving unit, has the potential to be a disruptive force in the transportation industry. If Cruise achieves commercial success before its competitors, it could add significant value to GM. (Q3 2022 earnings call)
>
> *Cost Cutting and Margin Expansion*: If GM successfully executes its cost-cutting and margin expansion plans, it could boost profitability and improve investor sentiment. (Q2 2021 earnings call)
>
> *Spin-off of GM Financial*: Management has stated it's considering a spin-off of GM Financial. A spin-off could unlock value for shareholders, as it would allow GM Financial to be valued independently of the auto business. (Q1 2020 earnings call)
>
> *Restructuring and Divestiture*: GM periodically undertakes restructuring and divestitures as part of its operating and strategic approach. These can have material impact on the stock price. (2019 Annual report)


**Recent Concerns:**

{: .warning }
>
> *Slow EV Ramp-up*:  GM's EV ramp-up has been slower than some investors expected. The company is facing production challenges, and it is trailing Tesla in market share. (Q3 2023 earnings call)
>
> *Cruise Losses*: Cruise is still losing significant amounts of money, raising concerns about its path to profitability. (Q2 2023 earnings call)
>
> *Competition*:  The competitive landscape in the auto industry is intensifying, and GM is facing pressure from both legacy automakers and new entrants. (Q4 2022 earnings call)
>
> *Economic Slowdown*:  A recession could hurt GM's sales and earnings, and it could put pressure on its financial position. (Q1 2022 earnings call)
>
> *Recession Fears*:  The markets reacted negatively after recessionary fears in the economy surfaced. (Q3 2020 earnings call)


> I believe it is important to approach GM with a **healthy dose of skepticism**. The company faces significant challenges, and its future success is far from certain.  While the valuation suggests the stock may be undervalued, the margin of safety is not large enough to compensate for the risks. Investors should remain vigilant and focused on the underlying fundamentals of the business.
