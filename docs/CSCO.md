>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

Cisco's moat stems primarily from high switching costs and the network effect. These are detailed below:

{: .note }
* **Switching Costs (3/5):**  Once a large organization has installed Cisco's networking equipment, switching to a competing system is costly and disruptive. This lock-in provides Cisco with pricing power. During its fiscal Q1 2024 earnings call, the company discussed the importance of its installed base and the "stickiness" of its customers.  However, the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN) and cloud-based solutions poses a long-term challenge to these switching costs.  {: .warning } As mentioned by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*, "Switching costs can be tough to identify", so continuous monitoring is required.  Moreover, the strength of switching costs can vary significantly across product categories.  This is why, as Graham and Dodd mention in *Security Analysis*, thorough industry research can provide better information than superficial impressions. {: .important }

{: .note }
* **Network Effect (2/5):**  The value of Cisco's products and services increases as more people use them.  This network effect is potent in some of the markets in which they operate. As discussed in *Measuring the Moat*, the network effect is stronger in closed networks, like futures exchanges, than in more open networks. For most of Cisco's customers, they can use products from many different vendors simultaneously, which weakens the network effect. This effect is most salient with some of their newer cloud-based products.   Further research is needed to assess the strength and sustainability of the network effects for these cloud-based products.

{: .note }
* **Intangible Assets (2/5):** Cisco has some brand value, but in the hyper-competitive technology space, brand power is less durable than it once was. Regulatory licenses and patents play a limited role in its business, compared to the broader network effect.   As mentioned by Pat Dorsey, popular brands aren't always profitable and "a well-known brand *isn't* enough to justify paying more." {: .warning }

{: .warning }
* **Cost Advantages (2/5):** Although Cisco previously enjoyed some process-based cost advantages, these have narrowed in recent years with competitors enhancing efficiency and implementing lean manufacturing strategies, especially in less-developed countries.  Given the highly specialized nature of their work, there is not much locational advantage.

Overall, Cisco's moat is being challenged by the rise of SDN, cloud computing, and increased competition in specific niches.  A rating of 3 out of 5 reflects this weakening but still present competitive advantage.

**Management Assessment**

Cisco's management receives a 3 out of 5 rating. This score reflects a number of concerns:

{: .note }
* **Capital Allocation (3/5):** Cisco has made a number of acquisitions over the years, some more successful than others.  Its acquisition of Acacia Communications was expensive, and the rationale has been questioned by some analysts and shareholders. However, the company has recently emphasized fiscal discipline and share buybacks, possibly indicating a shift towards more shareholder-friendly capital allocation. During its fiscal Q3 2023 earnings call, Cisco announced its intent to maintain strong share buybacks, which could deliver returns to shareholders.

{: .note }
* **Communication (3/5):** Cisco's management tends to focus on earnings per share, sometimes at the expense of intrinsic value.  As discussed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, "Many managers focus on earnings per share (EPS) and attempt to manage reported earnings." {: .warning } This can lead to short-term thinking.  Their communication about their moat and long-term strategy could be more transparent.   As Warren Buffet explains in his letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: "It is not only candid but essential communication". {: .important }
* **Compensation (3/5):**  Executive compensation is in line with peers, but there should be less emphasis on short term earnings per share and greater emphasis on metrics like return on invested capital (ROIC) and long-term growth.

{: .warning }
* **Insider Ownership (2/5):** Insider ownership is relatively low, which raises concerns about management's alignment with shareholders.  As discussed by Warren Buffet: "The best managers think like owners".

Overall, while Cisco's management is not terrible, there is room for improvement in several key areas, particularly with respect to more transparent and longer-term thinking.

**Catalyst Analysis**

Cisco's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5. The company is facing increasing competition and technological disruption, making it challenging for the company to grow. However, the stock offers a dividend yield of more than 3%  and it trades at a relatively low valuation, which provides some downside protection. There are few upcoming catalysts that could significantly increase the share price.

**Valuation**

{: .note }
This valuation uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on free cash flow to the firm. All numbers are presented in $US billions.

* **Base Case:**  Revenue growth of 1% for the next five years (from management's guidance in the fiscal Q4 2023 earnings call), followed by 0% growth in perpetuity. Pre-tax operating margin of 22% (from the most recent trailing 12 months).  A reinvestment rate of 35% (calculated from Ciscoâ€™s financials). A cost of capital of 7.5% (based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5%, a beta of 1, a cost of debt of 6%, and a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity (from fiscal 2023 10k)). The resulting present value is approximately $240 billion. Adding back Cisco's cash and marketable securities of $18 billion, subtracting out $20 billion of other noncurrent contractual obligations, $20 billion of debt and deducting $8 billion of equity compensation generates a fair value of $220 billion.

{: .new }
**Additional Scenarios:**  To test the sensitivity of the assumptions and to address uncertainty, we also constructed two scenarios.  An optimistic scenario with 2% revenue growth and 23% margins, yields a value of $250 billion, and a pessimistic scenario with 0% growth and 21% margins, yields a value of $200 billion.

**Recent Results and Outlook**

{: .warning }
Cisco's revenue and earnings have grown modestly over the last decade.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cisco experienced a downturn, as did many businesses. More recently, however, the firm has seen steady growth. A recent issue impacting the company is persistent supply chain constraints. In its fiscal Q4 2023 earnings call, management indicated that component supply and logistics issues have improved, although order lead times remain elevated.  Cisco is making progress in fulfilling customer backlog, and the company's supply chain is a source of strength for the firm.

**Other Concerns**

* **Competition:**  Cisco is facing increasing competition from cloud-based providers. The company is addressing this challenge through acquisitions and partnerships and through internal innovation.

{: .warning }
* **Security Concerns:** The cybersecurity space is constantly evolving, and Cisco faces a risk in being unable to maintain its strong position, which could damage its margins. The company is addressing this challenge through investments in security solutions.


**Conclusion**

Despite the challenges and uncertainties, Cisco is a high-quality company with a wide economic moat.  It is trading at a reasonable valuation, based on our DCF model.  The management is decent and the company is taking steps to address the challenges it faces.
