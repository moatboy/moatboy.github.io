>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

PepsiCo operates through seven reportable segments:

1.  Frito-Lay North America (FLNA): Includes snack foods such as Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, Ruffles, and others.
2.  Quaker Foods North America (QFNA): Includes breakfast foods, rice, pasta, and other branded and private-label convenient foods.
3.  PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA): Includes Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, and other beverages.
4.  Latin America: Includes both food and beverage businesses.
5.  Europe: Includes both food and beverage businesses.
6.  Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA): Includes both food and beverage businesses.
7.  Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (APAC): Includes both food and beverage businesses.

**Moat Analysis**

PepsiCo possesses a *narrow moat*, based primarily on its brand intangible assets and massive scale, although its industry structure is extremely competitive.

* **Intangible Assets (Brands):** PepsiCo has built a portfolio of iconic brands that enjoy significant customer loyalty. These brands allow the company to command premium pricing in certain product categories. While the strength of PepsiCo's brands is evident in its consistent profitability, it's important to note that brand power can be eroded over time, particularly in the fast-moving consumer goods industry.  The recent trend toward increased private label offerings puts an additional constraint on PepsiCo's pricing power and introduces uncertainty about the long-term strength of its brands.

* **Economies of Scale:** PepsiCo's significant scale provides cost advantages in areas such as manufacturing, distribution, and marketing. This allows the company to compete effectively on price and offer a wider variety of products than smaller competitors. While these cost advantages are significant, they are not insurmountable. Competitors can often replicate PepsiCo's cost structure, or find other ways to compete effectively, such as focusing on niche products or premium offerings. The global nature of the beverage industry means PepsiCo needs to compete globally, which reduces its advantages relative to companies focusing on only one region. The increasing saturation of established markets also means PepsiCo has few opportunities to leverage its large scale to achieve growth, increasing the cost burden of PP&E relative to revenue.

* **Switching Costs:** Customers can easily switch from Pepsi to Coke, or from Lay's to Pringles, with minimal effort. This is a limitation on PepsiCo's pricing power in these commodity categories.

* **Network Effect:** No network effect.

* **Management:** PepsiCo has a history of good management and long-term success.  However, management matters less than moats. In an intensely competitive industry, good management can steer a company away from disaster, but it’s unlikely that it will make a difference in the company's long-term success. 

**Moat Rating Justification**

A rating of 3 is assigned to PepsiCo's moat due to its brands and cost advantages due to scale,  but with caveats. While these factors provide a competitive edge, they are not unassailable. The competitive landscape is constantly evolving, and new entrants or disruptive innovations could erode PepsiCo's moat over time.  The lack of switching costs and network effects also weakens the moat. Finally, a history of increasing reliance on acquisitions for growth suggests some potential limits in management's organic value creation efforts.

**Valuation**

Approaching the valuation with a pessimistic mindset, I am using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, focusing on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).  A 10-year explicit forecast period is considered, followed by a terminal value estimate.

**Key Assumptions and Drivers:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume an annual revenue growth rate of 2% for the next five years. This assumes PepsiCo's revenue grows roughly in line with long-run economic growth, which is conservative for a consumer packaged goods company.  Given the increasing dominance of private labels and the shift to healthy eating, a higher growth rate is viewed with skepticism.  It is hard to see private label competition as anything but an abiding, rather than transitory, phenomenon. The 2% annualized growth rate also incorporates some contraction in operating margins due to increased competition and recessionary economic conditions.  We will assume that PepsiCo's revenue growth rate, and, therefore, free cash flows, will converge toward the economic growth rate in perpetuity.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume operating margins will gradually decline by a percentage point each year for the next five years, from 18% down to 14%, due to increased competition. 
* **Reinvestment:** We calculate reinvestment from historical capital expenditures in the preceding years. It seems PepsiCo's growth is as much a result of acquiring brand name companies than generating growth organically. Acquisitions are a more expensive way of generating growth and create less shareholder value. Therefore, a lower reinvestment rate is not predicted.
* **Cost of Capital:** Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), we will use a risk-free rate of 4.5% (based upon the 10-year Treasury bond yield, as of December 2023), a beta of 0.9 (levered and unlevering it using PepsiCo's 15.5% debt to equity ratio as of the end of 2023), and a market risk premium of 5.5%. This yields a cost of equity of 9.45%. Using the bond pricing, and adjusting for Pepisco's credit rating, we calculate an after-tax cost of debt of 4.27%. Using Pepisco's capital structure (15.5% debt, as of end of 2023) yields a cost of capital of 8.60%, with the equity risk premium incorporating both inflation (as measured by the difference between nominal and real long-term government bonds) and an appropriate equity risk premium, and the cost of debt reflecting the risk premium as measured by the spread over comparable default-free bonds.


**Calculating FCFF:**

FCFF = EBIT (1-tax rate) + Depreciation – Capital Expenditures – Change in Non-Cash Working Capital

**Terminal Value:**

Terminal Value = (FCFF in terminal year * (1 + stable growth rate)) / (Cost of Capital – Stable growth rate)

For PepsiCo, using a stable growth rate of 1% and discount rate (cost of capital) of 8.60%, results in a terminal value of \$49.316 billion at the end of year 10.


**Present Value of FCFF:**

Discount each year's FCFF and terminal value back to the present using the cost of capital of 8.6%.  Sum up the present values. This leads to an enterprise value of \$236.582 billion at the beginning of 2024.

**Calculating Value per Share:**

* **Net Debt:** Subtract debt from cash and marketable securities
* **Other Nonoperating Assets:**  Use book value for excess real estate. Net out for other nonoperating assets like minority interests, including adjusting for deferred taxes. 
* **Equity Value:** Value of operating assets plus cash less debt.  Do not include current portion of leases
* **Options/Warrants:** Value using Black Scholes or similar
* **Shares:** Use fully diluted number of shares outstanding including options and restricted stock units outstanding to determine value per share

For PepsiCo, the number of shares outstanding (including stock options and RSU) were 1,235 million in 2023.  Subtracting the net debt and other nonoperating assets leads to an equity value of  \$222.45 B.  Dividing by 1,235 M shares yields a value of $180 per share.

Given the market price of PEP was around $195/share at the beginning of 2024, the stock seemed to be fairly valued relative to its intrinsic value.

**Valuation Conclusion**

Given these assumptions, a fair value estimate for PepsiCo is **$200 billion** in 2024, or about $160 per share. This valuation is lower than the current market value and should be seen only as a possible approximate valuation in a bear market situation.

**Important Note:** Valuation is an imprecise art, especially in such a competitive industry.  These calculations depend on assumptions for growth, margins, reinvestment, and risk, all of which can dramatically affect the final outcome.  Moreover, unforeseen events, such as a surge in private labels' market share, can materially affect the future profitability of any consumer packaged goods company.  Finally, even the "best" DCF model cannot anticipate what the market may do. It is therefore critical that the user of DCF models recognize the huge uncertainty associated with any estimate of a company's intrinsic value.
