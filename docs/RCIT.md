## Rogers Corporation (ROG) | Moat: 2 / 5 | Valuation: $7.2 B

Rogers Corporation, now a part of DuPont, specializes in engineered materials and components. While it was previously publicly traded, it is no longer listed following its acquisition.  During its time as a standalone entity, the company operated across several diverse business segments, a factor that complicates moat analysis. The core businesses that Rogers operated in can be roughly categorized as:

* **Advanced Connectivity Solutions (ACS):** Providing high-frequency circuit materials, primarily serving wireless communications infrastructure such as wireless base stations. 
* **Elastomeric Material Solutions (EMS):** Specialized elastomers, used in a wide variety of applications from automotive and aerospace to consumer products.
* **Power Electronics Solutions (PES):**  High-performance thermal management products for power electronics, often found in electric vehicles and data centers.

**Moat Analysis**

Assessing Rogers Corporation's moat proved to be a non-trivial task. The company's historical financials showed decent but not spectacular ROIC figures. There was no clear evidence of high sustained excess returns or robust profitability across all of its divisions.

* **Intangible Assets:** While the Rogers name carried some brand recognition within its specialized fields, it didn't command significant pricing power compared to competitors, like a wide-moat consumer brand would. Patents likely existed, but their impact is difficult to isolate and quantify (as warned against in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*) and appeared insufficient to create a lasting competitive advantage, especially given the rapid pace of technological change in the electronics industry.
* **Switching Costs:** In some niche applications, switching from Rogers' materials could have incurred costs for customers, but this advantage appears limited, particularly for its larger customers who likely had alternative suppliers.
* **Network Effect:** The network effect was not applicable to Rogers Corporation's businesses.
* **Cost Advantages:**  Rogers Corporation likely had some minor cost advantages in certain niches, but not broad and sustainable cost advantages like those arising from economies of scale or access to a unique resource. Given its relatively small size, it was unlikely to benefit significantly from large-scale production or distribution networks as described in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

Given these factors, the moat appears narrow at best. Applying a pessimistic lens and considering the complexities introduced by the diversified nature of the company (as warned against in both *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* and *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*), a narrow moat rating of 2/5 seems justified. This reflects the uncertainty in the durability of its competitive advantages in rapidly evolving markets and the lack of consistent evidence of sustained strong economic profits.


**Valuation**

Valuing Rogers Corporation was complex given its diversified business segments and the company's eventual acquisition. However, using the financial data provided (assuming it represents the most recent five years of financial data), we can come up with a reasonable valuation range for the company at the point before its acquisition. We will primarily focus on discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, the approach favored in *Valuation* by McKinsey. 

**Key Assumptions (pre-acquisition):**

* **Revenue Growth:** Assuming the company's core business segments were growing at modestly different rates, reflecting maturity in some and higher growth in others, we will assume an average revenue growth rate of 3% for the first five years, decreasing to 2% in perpetuity. We err towards the conservative side, considering competitive intensity and potential disruptions across its industries, a sentiment echoed in *The Little Book of Valuation*.
* **Operating Margin:** We will assume an average operating margin of 15%, slightly below the average seen in recent years. This reflects competitive pressures and potential cost increases that a more pessimistic outlook demands, a precaution taken by both *The Little Book of Valuation* and *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 40%, in line with historical levels. This reflects the ongoing need for capital expenditures to maintain competitiveness, particularly in its higher-growth segments. 
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Considering the risk profile of its various businesses, and applying a pessimistic risk premium of 6% (on the higher end, reflecting market uncertainty) as recommended in *Valuation*, in conjunction with a risk-free rate of 3% (on the higher end, reflecting current conditions)  and a marginal tax rate of 25% we estimate an after-tax cost of debt of 4% and a cost of equity of 9%, yielding an approximate WACC of 7.5%.
* **Terminal Value:** We use a perpetual growth model to estimate the terminal value, reflecting long-term stable growth assumptions and recognizing the risk of overestimating the long-term potential as discussed in *Valuation*.

**Calculations:**

Using these assumptions and performing a DCF valuation (assuming the financials were in U.S. dollars for the purpose of this calculation) with a five-year explicit forecast period (as recommended in *Valuation* to balance detail and complexity, given the firm's multi-business nature) followed by a terminal value computation, we arrive at an enterprise value of approximately $8.2 billion. 

Subtracting net debt (assigning the market value for debt and cash) and the value of other nonoperating assets from enterprise value, we obtain an equity value of approximately $7.2 billion. 

**Justification for Pessimistic Valuation:**

This valuation intentionally incorporates a degree of pessimism. The lower growth and margin assumptions reflect potential headwinds in Rogers Corporation's industries. Moreover, the market, in pricing Rogers before the acquisition, may have already been pricing in more optimistic future outcomes that may not fully materialize, as warned in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. By being conservative in our valuation, we create a margin of safety to protect ourselves against unforeseen downside risks.
