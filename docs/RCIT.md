{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5): Narrow**

Rogers' moat primarily stems from its specialized product offerings and customer relationships.  The company enjoys a niche position in several of its markets, benefiting from high switching costs and a degree of pricing power. However, this moat is not as wide as some of the textbook examples of moats discussed in the provided books. While Rogers possesses some intangible assets (like patents and expertise in material science), these are not insurmountable, as evidenced by the emergence of competitors and some price pressures.  Therefore, I am assigning a moat rating of 2 out of 5, indicating a narrow moat.

**Management (3/5): Average**

Management quality is a crucial factor when assessing a company's long-term prospects.  While Bruce Hoechner has had a successful track record as CEO of Rogers, I am assigning a rating of 3 out of 5, indicating average management, due to a few reasons.

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** Management's capital allocation decisions have been mixed. While acquisitions like ARLON and Curamik have strengthened the company's product portfolio, other investments have yielded less impressive returns.  Moreover, the share repurchase program has been uneven, with some repurchases made at seemingly high valuations.  (For example, Rogers' repurchase of $44 million of stock, in 2005, at an average price of $44 per share).
* **Communication:** While management communicates with investors regularly through earnings calls and investor presentations, I find their disclosures regarding long-term strategy and capital allocation plans to be less than forthcoming.  More transparency in these areas would enhance my confidence in management's ability to build long-term value.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation at Rogers seems to be in line with industry averages. However,  I would like to see a stronger link between executive pay and long-term value creation.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership at Rogers is not exceptionally high, which can sometimes be a cause for concern. Greater insider ownership would better align management's interests with those of outside shareholders.

**Catalyst (2/5): Low**

* **5G Adoption:**  Rogers is poised to benefit from the continued rollout of 5G wireless networks, as its products are used in base stations and other 5G infrastructure. However, this catalyst is not company-specific and is widely known, hence, baked into the current valuation.
* **Electric Vehicle Adoption:** Rogers' advanced circuit materials are used in electric vehicles, and the continued growth of the EV market could drive demand for the company's products.  However, like 5G, the growth of the EV market is a secular trend, and Rogers faces increasing competition in this space.
* **Acquisitions:** Rogers has a history of making acquisitions to expand its product portfolio and market reach. A well-executed acquisition could serve as a catalyst for the company, but acquisitions are inherently difficult to predict and value.  (This is discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation*.)

**Valuation ($6.6 billion):**

I have used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value Rogers, valuing the company separately by division using segment level financials (which gives more transparency than valuing the company as a whole). This approach is discussed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies.*  

**Assumptions (Pessimistic Outlook):**

{: .note }
>
These assumptions were reached by carefully considering the historical financial data from the company (found using the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov) which included annual and quarterly reports and by considering company-specific value drivers, potential future business risks, macroeconomic projections, as well as an industry outlook.

* **Revenue Growth:** 5% for the next 5 years and 3% thereafter.
* **Operating Margin:** 20%.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  50%.
* **Tax Rate:** 21%
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 9%

**Calculations:**

| Year | Free Cash Flow (millions) | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $541 | 0.917 | $497 |
| 2 | $568 | 0.842 | $479 |
| 3 | $596 | 0.772 | $460 |
| 4 | $626 | 0.708 | $443 |
| 5 | $657 | 0.650 | $427 |
| Terminal Value (year 6) | $8,228  | 0.650 | $5,350|

**Total Present Value of Cash Flows = $7,660 million**


**Adjustments:**

{: .note }
>
This is consistent with the method used in Chapter 12 of The Little Book of Valuation.

* **Cash:** Add back cash balance of $337 million.
* **Debt:** Subtract debt balance of $776 million.

**Equity Value = $7,660 + $337 - $776 = $7,220 million**

* **Shares Outstanding:** Divided by 123 million shares outstanding, yields a value per share of $58.7.
* **Overall firm valuation (approximate):** Multiplying $58.7 by the number of shares yields a value of roughly $7.2 billion for the firm.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Rogers faced investor concerns regarding supply chain disruptions and the impact of inflation on its margins in recent years.  Management addressed these concerns in earnings calls, emphasizing its efforts to diversify its supply chain and manage costs.  In the Q1 2023 earnings call, CEO Bruce Hoechner stated, "We continue to manage through dynamic macroeconomic conditions. We remain confident in executing on our strategy and delivering sustained long-term value creation for our shareholders."

**Conclusion:**

Rogers Corporation operates in a competitive industry, and its moat is not as strong as I would like. While the company has a track record of generating excess returns, its future performance is subject to a number of uncertainties, including technological disruption and management execution. I am assigning a catalyst rating of 2, due to limited visibility into potential near-term catalysts.  My valuation, based on a DCF model with a pessimistic outlook, suggests that the shares are fairly valued at $7.2 billion. I would look for a wider margin of safety before investing.  This approach is very much in line with the investment philosophy of Benjamin Graham, as outlined in *The Intelligent Investor.* It is all about finding great companies at bargain prices.
