{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

While Chesapeake benefits from some elements of a narrow moat, these are partially offset by the cyclicality and commodity nature of the business and intensifying competition in the natural gas market.

* **Strengths:** Chesapeake operates in established shale plays, benefiting from lower finding costs, economies of scale, and transportation infrastructure.
* **Weaknesses:** Commodity prices are a key driver of revenue and earnings.  Competition among exploration and production companies, as well as from integrated energy companies, keeps pricing power limited. Chesapeake's reliance on debt financing increases vulnerability to commodity price swings and reduces financial flexibility. Switching costs are low.
* **Narrow:** I am rating Chesapeake's moat as narrow due to the combination of some cost advantages and limited pricing power in its established shale plays. However, the commodity nature of the business makes these advantages less potent than in other industries.

**Management (2/5):**

Chesapeake's management team's rating is restricted by the company's recent history of financial distress, raising doubts about their capital allocation skills and long-term strategic thinking. 

* **History:** Chesapeake previously faced substantial financial distress due to overexpansion and taking on too much debt which led to a bankruptcy proceeding in 2021. Although the company emerged from bankruptcy with a deleveraged balance sheet and a renewed focus on financial discipline, the prior choices reflect poorly on management's strategic decision-making.
* **Experience:**  The current management team, led by President and CEO Nick Dell'Osso, has experience in the energy sector. However, the team's ability to navigate the company's emergence from bankruptcy and create sustained shareholder value remains to be seen.
* **Communication:** Chesapeake communicates regularly through earnings calls, presentations, and SEC filings. They present operational and financial information, guidance, updates on business strategies, and risk factors.  However, their previous opacity in communicating their financial difficulties and subsequent bankruptcy filing raises concerns about transparency.  
* **Capital Allocation:** The company's recent focus has been on debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Their prior capital allocation decisions, especially regarding leverage, have proven disastrous.  Their current financial discipline is positive, but its sustainability remains to be seen.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation packages include salary, bonus, stock awards, and other benefits. As of February 2021, Mr. Lawler’s 2020 Base Salary and Total Compensation was $533,661 and $1,572,903, respectively, while Mr. Dell’Osso Jr.’s 2020 Base Salary and Total Compensation was $343,333 and $501,333, respectively.  This suggests somewhat reasonable compensation in line with other small exploration and production firms.
* **Insider Ownership:** While insider ownership exists, it is moderate.
* **Overall:** Although the current management team's emphasis on debt reduction and returning capital to shareholders is a step in the right direction, the company's recent emergence from bankruptcy raises serious concerns about management's long-term strategic thinking and ability to create shareholder value. The rating of 2/5 reflects their relatively short tenure, the mixed track record on previous capital allocation decisions, and the need for continued demonstration of prudent management practices.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

Several potential catalysts could drive Chesapeake's share price higher:

* **Continued natural gas price strength:** As a natural gas producer, Chesapeake's earnings and cash flow are directly linked to natural gas prices. Continued strength in natural gas prices would be a powerful catalyst for the company.
* **Successful execution of the current business strategy:** The company’s recent acquisition of Chief and Vine has been presented by management as a strategic realignment. Management's stated strategy is to be "the lowest cost, premier public natural gas producer" in the U.S. by achieving sustainable free cash flow and increasing return on assets.  Management has set long-term strategic goals such as achieving a 20% reduction of methane intensity by 2025. (CHK 2021 10-K). Successful implementation of the management team's stated strategy could drive improved operating performance and increase investor confidence, boosting the stock price.
* **Acquisition Synergies:** Realizing projected cost savings and revenue enhancements from acquisitions (Vine Acquisition, Marcellus Acquisition, Chief Acquisition) would increase free cash flow and make the stock more attractive.
* **Continued deleveraging and return of capital to shareholders:** Continued debt paydown, paired with higher dividend payments or share repurchases, would increase equity value and could be viewed positively by the market.
* **Increased investor interest in domestic natural gas:** Increased focus on energy independence and security, coupled with positive public perceptions of natural gas as a "bridge fuel," could increase investor interest in domestic natural gas producers like Chesapeake.
* **Overall:** While Chesapeake's share price is sensitive to commodity price swings, the company also benefits from operating leverage, making it a high-risk, high-return investment. Successful execution of the company’s stated strategy is a strong potential catalyst for shareholder return. Moreover, the company is well positioned for investors interested in domestic natural gas production. Taking into account recent positive developments, CHK earns a catalyst rating of 3/5.

**Business:**

Chesapeake operates in a cyclical industry where commodity prices dictate profitability.  

* **Revenues:** Chesapeake's revenues primarily come from the sale of natural gas, oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs).  The percentage of revenue derived from gas is approximately 75%, with the remainder coming from NGL (20%) and oil (5%). (CHK 2023 Q3 10-Q) Consequently, gas prices play a disproportionately large role in Chesapeake's valuation. Geographic revenue distribution has historically been heavily concentrated in the United States (95% and higher).
* **Trends:** The industry has seen several waves of entry and consolidation.  The boom in shale gas has led to increased production in the United States, making the market more competitive and reducing the ability of individual companies to influence prices.  Recently, there has been a consolidation wave in which small operators have been acquired by larger players or forced out of the market due to financial difficulties.  (CHK 2020 10-K) In addition, the increased adoption of digital technology has intensified competition in the industry and reduced information asymmetry, as in the example of OpenTable.  Finally, the increasing role of social and environmental concerns, including regulation to limit methane gas emissions and the rise of ESG investing, has increased costs and constrained revenue growth. (CHK 2022 Q2 10-Q)
* **Margins:** Operating profit margins are cyclical and low (relative to other industries), especially given the need to make ongoing substantial capital expenditures and acquisitions.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Chesapeake faces competition from other exploration and production companies, as well as larger integrated energy companies.  As noted in the *Little Book of Valuation*, commodity industries have low switching costs for buyers, increasing their price-sensitivity. The industry's low ROIC are also in line with what you would expect in a fragmented market.  However, the industry is becoming more consolidated, with a substantial portion of U.S. production being generated by the top 10 players.  This may increase stability, reduce excess capacity, and result in better profitability in the long term.  For example, in CHK’s 2022 Q4 earnings call, the CFO stated: “Our view of the natural gas industry is that we've reached a point of sustainable strength with demand at record levels”.

**Valuation ($8.12):**

I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value Chesapeake.  I am using a scenario-based DCF model, assigning probabilities to different scenarios.

* **Base Case:** Reflects the status quo.  I assume revenue growth of 4% annually,  an EBITDA margin of 20%, and a cost of equity of 9.0% (derived using an APV approach).
* **Downside Scenario:** Reflects a downturn in the energy markets. I assume revenue growth of 0%, an EBITDA margin of 10%, and a cost of equity of 15%.
* **Probabilities:** I assign probabilities of 70% to the base case and 30% to the downside scenario.  I derived these probabilities from observing the historical volatility of natural gas prices and considering CHK’s credit rating (B+ from S&P in February 2009).
* **Note:** The DCF analysis incorporates the company's debt and its book value of equity, as well as the tax benefits of debt.  The DCF valuation approach, although it requires judgment, is appropriate here since we are interested in modeling the implications of financial risk, the tax benefits of debt, and other valuation issues for companies.

**Calculations:**

|                | Base Case | Downside | Probability | Weighted |
|----------------|----------|---------|------------|---------|
| Value of Firm   | $10,340  | $3,060   | 70%       | $7,238  |
| Value of Firm   | $10,340  | $3,060   | 30%       | $918   |
| Probability Weighted Value of Firm | $8,156 |

Value per share = Value of Firm / Number of shares = $8,156 million / 1,005 = $8.12


**Additional Considerations:**

The Chesapeake–Southwestern merger:  Chesapeake has announced an agreement to merge with Southwestern Energy Company (SWN), combining the strengths of two energy production firms. The two companies overlap in the Haynesville and Marcellus basins. As a result of the merger, CHK shareholders will receive about 56% of the equity of the surviving company (CHK Presentation) and CHK’s earnings and share count will increase accordingly. Assuming that the merger is indeed value-enhancing for CHK shareholders and that the valuation in this case is based on the combined company, this would further increase my valuation.  
However, I have concerns about this deal. I think that merging two very similar businesses at this cyclical low with a highly levered balance sheet seems to be a recipe for disaster, even ignoring all the bad past capital allocation decisions.  (CHK News Release, November 8, 2023)

I also did an additional valuation using multiples. The EV/EBITDA multiple of comparable companies in January 2020 was in the vicinity of 8, and the multiple increased with increasing commodity prices and improved financial health. The average EBITDA/BOE (Barrel of Oil Equivalent) of CHK was around 8 in 2020. Since CHK was in financial distress in 2020, with a B rating, and has since deleveraged, I will use a multiple of 8-10 for the company's enterprise value. That yields an intrinsic value estimate in the vicinity of 8.0 billion (based on a multiple of 8 applied to their 2024 EBITDA). (CHK 2023 10-K)
