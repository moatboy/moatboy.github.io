# Gilead Sciences
{: .fs-9 }

{: .label .label-purple }

Moat: 2/5

{: .label .label-yellow }

Pessimistic value: $70 billion

Gilead Sciences is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative medicines. While it once held a dominant position in the HIV market, increased competition and patent expirations have led to a decline in revenues and profits.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Gilead's revenue comes primarily from antiviral medications, with HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) products being its key revenue drivers. The remaining revenues are from other antiviral products, such as those for the treatment of influenza and COVID-19. It operates across the globe with a geographic split between Americas, Europe, and Asia. The Americas region contributes the highest percentage of Gilead's revenue, followed by Europe and Japan.
* **Industry Trends:** The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is highly competitive, and Gilead faces significant competition from both brand-name and generic drug manufacturers.  The industry is characterized by high research and development (R&D) spending, long product development cycles, and substantial regulatory hurdles. While innovation is essential for success, it is also costly and time-consuming, with a high rate of failure for new drug candidates.  The industry is also subject to significant pricing pressures, particularly as drugs lose patent protection and face generic competition.  Patent expirations and increasing competition have eroded Gilead's dominance in the HIV market, and it faces similar challenges with its HCV franchise.
* **Margins:** Gilead's operating margin has been declining over the past few years due to lower sales of its key products. The company is facing pricing pressure for some of its older products and has been forced to offer rebates and discounts to maintain market share. The company's return on invested capital (ROIC) also declined, from 40 percent in 2015 to 17 percent in 2019.

**Moat Analysis**

Gilead's moat is narrow, primarily based on intangible assets in the form of its strong brand name and patents, giving it a rating of 2 out of 5.

* **Intangible Assets:** Gilead's brand name is well-known and respected in the HIV market. The company also has a portfolio of patents on its key products. However, these patents have limited lives, and some of the company's key products are already facing generic competition. This erodes the moat's strength and durability.
* **Switching Costs:** Gilead benefits from moderate switching costs associated with its HIV therapies. Patients who have been successfully treated with Gilead's drugs are often reluctant to switch to a new medication.  However, these switching costs are not absolute and are not as strong as those seen in industries like software or banking. New competitor drugs and the rise of generics can induce switching and weaken the power of this switching cost moat.
* **Network Effects:**  Network effects are not applicable in this industry.
* **Cost Advantages:** Gilead does not have significant cost advantages. The company's manufacturing costs are in line with those of its competitors.  In fact, the high cost of innovation and drug development acts as a barrier to entry and hence a form of cost advantage in that it makes it difficult for most competitors to compete. However, generic drug manufacturers can enter the market once the drug loses its patent and typically offer the drugs at much lower prices than the incumbent drug manufacturer, thus mitigating or destroying the cost advantage, when considering generic drug manufacturers as potential future competitors of the incumbent.
* **Eroding Moat:**  Gilead's competitive advantages are eroding. The company's patents are expiring, and it is facing increasing competition from generic drug manufacturers.

> {: .warning} Gilead's narrow moat based on intangible assets is weakening due to patent expirations and increasing competition.  This makes it difficult to assign a high moat rating.

**Valuation**

To value Gilead Sciences, we have used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using FCFF, with projections from 2024 to 2033 and discounting the value back to today.
<br>
<br>
**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We will assume Gilead's revenue will be growing at 3.5 percent per year. This is the average growth rate of the US economy (GDP) since 1950.
* **Margins:** Gilead's operating margin has been declining in recent years. To be conservative, we'll assume margins will stabilize at 30% of revenue, their 2022 level.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  We'll assume a reinvestment rate of 10%.
* **Cost of Capital:** The cost of capital for Gilead is 7.56%, taking into account its Beta, Debt to Equity ratio, Tax Rate, Risk Free Rate, Market Risk Premium, and so on.
* **Terminal Value:** We assume that Gilead will be growing at the same rate as GDP over the very long term, and assign the firm a 3 percent terminal growth rate. With this estimate of sustainable terminal growth, we can derive the terminal value at the end of year 10 by using the following equation:

```
Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 10 * (1 - Reinvestment rate)) / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate)
Terminal Value = ($4,940 * (1 - 0.10)) / (0.075 - 0.03) = $98,464 million
```

<br>

**Calculations:**
{: .highlight }

* **Free Cash Flow:** Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) is the after-tax operating income minus the net capital expenditures and working capital needs of the firm. It is the cash flow available to all providers of capital to the firm, regardless of capital structure. We first obtain FCFF for years 2024 to 2033 by using the equation: FCFF = Revenue * Operating Margin * (1 - Tax rate) * (1 - Reinvestment Rate).
* **Present Value of Free Cash Flow:** We then discount these cash flows at the cost of capital to arrive at their present value.
* **Present Value of Terminal Value:** We discount the terminal value by the cost of capital to arrive at its present value as of today.
* **Value of Operating Assets:** We add up the present value of the projected cash flows and the present value of the terminal value to arrive at the value of the operating assets.

Based on these assumptions and calculations, the enterprise value (the value of the operating assets) of Gilead Sciences is estimated to be about $70 billion, which translates to about $53 per share. This assumes that the firm will continue to operate as a going concern.

> {: .important }  Given the uncertainty and competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, we have used fairly conservative assumptions to build a margin of safety into the valuation.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Drug Pipeline:** Gilead's drug pipeline is a key driver of its future growth.  However, drug development is inherently risky, and there is no guarantee that any of the company's current drug candidates will be commercially successful.
* **Competition:** Gilead faces intense competition from other large pharmaceutical companies, which could pressure its margins and growth in the future.
* **Management:** Gilead's management team has a strong track record. However, it is always possible that management could make mistakes that could hurt the company's future performance.  A skeptical and pessimistic outlook leads to being conservative about management quality.

> {: .warning } The pharmaceutical industry is complex and inherently risky. The valuation is based on conservative assumptions, but it is still possible that the actual results could be significantly different from the estimated value.
