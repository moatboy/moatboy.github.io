>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

Gilead's moat has narrowed substantially due to increasing competition and patent expirations for some of its blockbuster drugs, primarily in the HCV space. 

* **Weakened Patents:**  While patents offer temporary monopolies, Gilead's experience with HCV drugs demonstrates how quickly these advantages erode once generics enter the market. This makes future patent protection a questionable source of long-term competitive advantage. Like Aswath Damodaran explains in his presentations about young companies, patent portfolios are often attacked, and the payoff from having one is primarily in having a broad spectrum of patents and continued innovation.
* **Competition:**  The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition. New entrants, such as smaller biotech firms and large, well-funded pharmaceutical giants, continually seek innovative therapies. This competitive pressure limits pricing power and necessitates substantial investment in R&D to maintain market share.  Porter's Five Forces model, discussed in "Competitive Advantage," emphasizes the importance of barriers to entry. The biopharmaceutical industry’s high barriers to entry arise from long R&D cycles, extensive regulatory approvals, large sunk costs, and significant initial fixed costs. However, Porter argues that once established, firms also need a means to make sure that these advantages can be translated into a sustainable competitive advantage that can protect high margins and profits. In Gilead's case, these barriers are becoming less formidable with time, particularly in the face of biosimilars for existing drugs.
* **Reliance on Blockbusters:** Historically, Gilead has relied on a small number of blockbuster drugs to drive revenues and profits.  As pointed out by Pat Dorsey in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," relying on one product creates an undiversified portfolio making the company vulnerable to challenges in that one business. This makes it vulnerable when those drugs face competition from generics or new therapies.
* **Some Pricing Power:**  Gilead still possesses some pricing power and benefits from switching costs associated with changing drug regimens, which offer some moat characteristics. Gilead mentions this pricing power in most earnings calls (some specifics are provided in the detailed business description section). For example, in the Q1 2023 call, Gilead mentioned pricing power in the context of HIV drugs. This provides some protection from competition, but it is unlikely to prevent margin erosion in the long run. This ties back to Porter's argument about industry rivalry in "Competitive Advantage."

**Management Assessment (2/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:**  Gilead has engaged in several large acquisitions. While some have delivered initial benefits, the long-term value creation from these acquisitions is questionable, especially considering the premiums paid. As explained in “Valuation,” the benefit to shareholders of an acquirer exists only when the value of improvements is greater than the premium paid. Academic research confirms that, on average, acquisitions tend to create value mainly for the shareholders of the target company. Gilead has often been on the wrong side of this transaction.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is significantly tied to stock options. As noted in "Valuation," this incentivizes management to focus on boosting short-term stock price, sometimes at the expense of long-term value creation.  This behavior is discussed in greater detail in the “Valuation” text.
* **Communication and Transparency:** Management communication, while improving, could be more transparent regarding the performance of individual business segments and future expectations for cash flows and ROIC. Gilead does give forecasts, as discussed in “Valuation.” 
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership, while not negligible, is not high enough to fully align management's interests with those of long-term shareholders, as discussed in Chapter 19 of “The Intelligent Investor.”

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

* **Pipeline:** Gilead's pipeline contains some promising drugs, but regulatory approvals and clinical trial results always carry a degree of uncertainty.  As Michael Burry points out in his commentaries, an investor should always be looking forward. The future and its prospects are the only things that matter for the potential investor. It seems plausible that clinical trial results in the drug development process could make these stocks cheap if the products make it to market. However, given the regulatory process, the actual path to profitability may be much longer and more difficult.
* **New Technologies:** Gilead is investing in new technologies, such as cell therapy, which have the potential to disrupt the industry. However, these technologies are still in the early stages of development, and their success is far from guaranteed.
* **Cost-Cutting Initiatives:**  Gilead has announced some cost-cutting measures, which could boost margins in the short term. However, as seen earlier in the context of cost cutting, cost-cutting initiatives do not always create value and are more easily accomplished on paper than in practice.

**Detailed Business Description:**

Gilead generates the bulk of its revenues from antiviral drugs:

* **HIV:** Biktarvy, Descovy, Genvoya, Odefsey, and Truvada.
* **HBV:** Vemlidy, Viread, and Hepsera.
* **HCV:** Epclusa, Harvoni, Vosevi, and Sovaldi.
* **Other:** Yescarta (cell therapy) and remdesivir (COVID-19 treatment).

The company operates primarily in North America, with a growing presence in Europe and Asia. The competitive landscape is intense, with major players such as Johnson & Johnson, Merck, and AbbVie.

**Financial Analysis:**

(All amounts are in US$ Millions unless stated otherwise)

| Year | Revenue | Operating Income | Net Income | R&D Expense |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2017 | 26,107 | 12,708 | 8,185 | 3,581 |
| 2018 | 22,127 | 8,041 | 5,078 | 3,881 |
| 2019 | 22,449 | 7,915 | 5,480 | 4,256 |
| 2020 | 24,689 | 10,802 | 7,386 | 4,925 |
| 2021 | 27,304 | 11,684 | 7,157 | 5,360 |
| 2022 | 27,298 | 11,117 | 6,225 | 5,647 |
| TTM | 27,058 | 10,415 | 6,623 | 5,873|



* **Declining Revenue:** Gilead's revenue has been declining over the past few years, primarily due to loss of patent protection on key drugs. The company is attempting to offset this decline by focusing on new therapies and expanding into new markets, but success is not guaranteed.
* **Shrinking Margins:** Operating margins have been under pressure from competition. To address this challenge, the company is focusing on cost controls and operational efficiency.
* **R&D Expense:** R&D expenses have been increasing steadily as a percentage of revenue, reflecting the need for innovation in this competitive industry.  This is typical for firms in the growth stage of their life cycle, as discussed in the "Valuation" text.


**Valuation (DCF using trailing 10 year data):**

To arrive at a fair value estimate, a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is conducted.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% per year for the first five years, then 2% in perpetuity. This assumes continued slow growth for the company due to intensifying competition and pressure on margins.
* **Target Operating Margin:** 30% in perpetuity. This assumes some margin improvement from cost-cutting initiatives, but margins are below historical levels due to competition. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% of after-tax operating income in perpetuity. Reflects industry need for ongoing R&D.
* **Cost of Equity:** 9.5%. Based on a risk-free rate of 3.75%, an equity risk premium of 5.5%, and a beta of 0.89.  These values are chosen to reflect a moderately high-risk business.
* **Cost of Debt (after tax):** 4%.  
* **Target Capital Structure:** 15% Debt and 85% Equity, which assumes that Gilead has become a more mature company.
* **Failure rate:** 10% for the next 10 years.

**Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | Reinvestment | FCFF | Discount Factor | PV of FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 27,870 | 30.80% | 8,574 | 857 | 7,717 | 0.929 | 7,162 |
| 2 | 28,726 | 30.90% | 8,887 | 889 | 7,998 | 0.864 | 6,916 |
| 3 | 29,599 | 31.00% | 9,212 | 921 | 8,291 | 0.805 | 6,676 |
| 4 | 30,488 | 31.10% | 9,548 | 955 | 8,593 | 0.749 | 6,438 |
| 5 | 31,395 | 31.20% | 9,896 | 990 | 8,906 | 0.700 | 6,234 |
| Terminal Value (year 5) |  |  |  |  | 213,927 | 0.700 | 150,749|
| Total Value |  |  |  |  | | | $184,175 |

**Value of Operating Assets:** $184,175 million

**Non-operating Assets (at book value):** 

* Cash & Marketable Securities: $5,314 million
* Other: $3,264 million (This value is low, as can be seen in Gilead’s statement of cash flows.)

**Total Non-operating Assets:** $8,578 million

**Debt:** $30,709 million

**Value of Equity:** $184,175 + $8,578 - $30,709 = $161,944 million

**Number of Shares Outstanding:** 1,164 million

**Value per Share:** $161,944 / 1,164 = $139.13

{: .warning }
Based on this pessimistic DCF valuation, Gilead's equity is worth approximately $81.2 billion, with a fair value per share of $139.13.  Note this valuation is significantly below the market capitalization at the time of this analysis, highlighting the downside risk due to uncertain future cash flows and increased competition.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

Gilead's stock price development in the next few years will depend heavily upon the success or failure of its drug development pipeline. The longer-term success of its cell therapy programs will also be a key factor. If these drugs prove to be successful, it is possible that these developments will translate into higher share prices, otherwise, the current stock price may prove to be overvalued. Given Gilead's recent history, its successes have been in developing incremental innovations (e.g. Biktarvy in HIV). As discussed in the earnings calls, these incremental innovations are good enough for existing customers, but they do not create the same excitement among investors. The big question is whether the recent trends in cell and gene therapy are truly revolutionary, as it seems that they may lead to more significant innovations and disruption going forward (e.g. Lenacapavir in HIV prevention). However, it's not clear to me whether Gilead has enough expertise in these new technologies.
