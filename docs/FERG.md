{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Ferguson's moat primarily stems from **scale advantages** within its niche. Its extensive distribution network of over 2,000 stores across the United States gives it cost advantages through localized delivery and quick repairs, making it difficult for smaller competitors to compete. However, this scale advantage is limited to regional markets and isn't insurmountable, particularly as larger competitors enhance their own distribution networks.

{: .warning }

There is little evidence of **intangible assets**, **customer switching costs**, or the **network effect**.
Brand recognition is not strong enough to confer significant pricing power, and customers are relatively price-sensitive in this industry. Switching costs, while perhaps existing for some commercial customers due to integrated systems, are likely minimal for most individual customers.

**Management (3/5):**

Management has a mixed record.  While they have overseen growth and expansion, capital allocation decisions have been questionable at times.

* **Positives:** The company has a history of strong operating margins and returns on capital. Management has also been communicative, providing detailed segment information.  (Information sourced from company financials and earnings calls).
* **Negatives:**  Ferguson’s move away from the UK market, although ultimately successful, involved some initial missteps. Additionally, acquisitions have played a significant role in growth, which always carries the risk of overpayment. This raises concerns about management’s ability to consistently generate organic growth. Furthermore, executive compensation, while not excessive, is still heavily weighted towards stock options, raising the same concerns about short-term incentives as raised by Warren Buffet in his letters. (See "The Essays of Warren Buffet").  Finally, insider ownership, while present, is not substantial enough to fully align management’s interests with those of long-term shareholders.

{: .note }

Management's decision to redomicile to the UK and subsequent switch to the US raises questions about long-term strategic focus and adaptability. (Q2 2021 earnings call). Recent concerns about supply chain disruptions and inflation also indicate potential challenges for management in navigating a changing environment. (Q3 2022 earnings call).

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for share price appreciation include continued market share growth, successful integration of acquisitions, and a rebound in the housing market in the US.

{: .important }

However, given the cyclical nature of the housing market and broader economic uncertainty, these catalysts are not highly probable in the near term.  The company’s exposure to the housing market makes it particularly susceptible to macroeconomic headwinds.

**Valuation ($25.44 billion):**

We used a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model to value Ferguson. This is the most rigorous approach, as emphasized in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies," but it requires making assumptions, especially about growth and returns on invested capital. We opted for a conservative, pessimistic approach in light of current market conditions and the company’s cyclical nature.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a base case revenue growth of 3% over the next five years, reflecting the potential slowdown in the US housing market.  We then assume this declines to 2% over the remainder of perpetuity.
* **Operating Margin:** We use the average margin of the past five years (9.95%), declining linearly to 9.3% in perpetuity. (Information obtained from Ferguson's financial statements)
* **Cost of Capital:** We calculated a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%. This incorporates a risk-free rate of 3.8%, an equity risk premium of 4.27%, a beta of 0.92, a cost of debt of 4.27%, and a target capital structure of 19.5% debt and 80.5% equity. (Data from company financials, Bloomberg, and market data as of August 2023).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 29.5% based on historical levels. This could drop if management shifts strategy, which we analyze in scenarios later in the valuation.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow:** Project free cash flow (FCF) each year.
2. **Terminal Value:**  Estimate a terminal value using the stable growth formula for a perpetuity.
3. **Present Value:**  Discount both the FCF and the terminal value back to present value using the WACC.
4. **Value of Non-operating Assets:** We value excess cash and marketable securities and add it to the present value of operations to arrive at enterprise value (EV).
5. **Equity Value:**  Subtract debt from EV to arrive at equity value.
6. **Value per Share:** Divide equity value by the number of shares outstanding.

{: .highlight }

For complete calculations, please refer to the tables below.


| Year | FCF ($ millions) | PV of FCF ($ millions) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3,395 | $3,215 |
| 2 | $3,565 | $3,129 |
| 3 | $3,744 | $3,045 |
| 4 | $3,932 | $2,963 |
| 5 | $4,129 | $2,882 |
| Terminal Value |  | $49,316 |
| **Enterprise Value** |  | **$64,550** |

Number of shares outstanding (July 2023): 445 million. Total debt: $2.5 billion (approximate).

Equity Value: $64,550 million - $2,500 million = $62,050 million

Value per share: $62,050 million / 445 million = $139.44


**Business:**

Ferguson operates in a relatively fragmented industry, providing it some pricing power. However, as noted in "Competitive Strategy" by Michael Porter, the threat of new entrants and substitute products remains, keeping returns on capital in check.  The company’s core business is in the US, and it has benefited from the US housing market boom. However, this also creates a dependence on macroeconomic factors.  Ferguson distributes a wide range of products, which helps diversify its revenue base.  Its large size enables it to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers.

**Financials:**

Ferguson has consistently generated healthy operating profits and returns on capital exceeding its cost of capital, though both metrics have fluctuated significantly due to its link to the cyclicality of the housing market.


| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin |
|---|---|---|
| 2021 | $22,797 | 10.7% |
| 2022 | $26,677 | 11.8% |
| 2023 | $27,015 | 11.1% |

{: .warning }

The company is currently highly leveraged, which could be a concern if the housing market experiences a prolonged downturn.  This financial leverage also amplifies potential returns (and losses) for shareholders.


**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Exposure to US Housing Market:**  A potential slowdown or decline in the US housing market would significantly impact Ferguson’s revenues and profits.
* **Supply Chain Disruptions and Inflation:**  Recent increases in input costs and logistics challenges have squeezed margins.  The company’s ability to pass these cost increases onto customers will be crucial. (Q3 2022 earnings call).


**Conclusion:**

Ferguson has some competitive advantages stemming from its scale and market position, but it does not possess a wide moat.  Management’s record is mixed, and the company is significantly exposed to cyclical factors. While the current valuation appears reasonable, investors should be cautious given the company’s limited moat and dependence on the health of the US housing market.
