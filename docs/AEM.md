**Moat Assessment (2/5)**

While AEM benefits from some cost advantages stemming from its ownership of high-quality mines with long reserve lives (as discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, location advantages can create mini-monopolies), it operates in a commodity industry.  As noted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*,  commodity industries are generally very price-competitive, and most commodity products have low switching costs, limiting the ability of individual companies to dig sustainable economic moats. Further, the exploration and development of new gold deposits also reduces its moat. AEM lacks strong intangible assets (brands, patents) and meaningful customer switching costs (customers primarily care about price). The network effect is also not present.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

AEM's management team has a mixed track record.

* **Positives:** The company has generally demonstrated prudent capital allocation, focusing on developing existing mines and making accretive acquisitions (for example the recent acquisition of Kirkland Lake Gold).  Their long-term focus is also a plus, as exemplified by their decision to proceed with the Odyssey project despite near-term cost pressures (Q1 2023 earnings call). They have a record of fostering employee satisfaction (AEM's CEO mentioned in the Q4 2022 earnings call about their focus on employee wellness and mental health, which resulted in a lower than industry average Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate.) and maintaining positive labor relations. 
* **Negatives:**  AEM's high executive compensation raises concerns (as inspired by Michael Burry's skepticism towards executive compensation). While linked to performance, its absolute level is high. Insider ownership could be higher to enhance alignment with shareholder interests. Management communication, while transparent, can be overly optimistic during earnings calls, especially on production forecasts (for example the downward revisions to guidance in Q1 2023).

**Business Overview**

* **Revenue Distribution:** AEM generates revenue primarily from the sale of gold, with smaller contributions from other metals like silver.  Geographically, Canada and Finland contribute to the major chunk of the revenue. Revenue has increased consistently over the years, driven by higher production and gold prices (for example, in the Q1 2023 earnings call the CEO discussed a 30% y-o-y increase in revenue.)
* **Industry Trends:**  The gold mining industry is cyclical, tied to fluctuations in the price of gold and the overall economy.  Consolidation is ongoing (as discussed in *Competitive Advantage*, a mature industry structure is expected.) in the industry, with larger players like AEM acquiring smaller competitors. Technological innovation is focused on improving mining efficiency and reducing costs.  
* **Margins:**  AEM's margins are sensitive to gold prices and operating costs.  Margins have been healthy in recent years due to higher gold prices, but they can fluctuate substantially (as noted in *Valuation*).  The focus remains on improving efficiency and managing costs (Q1 2023 earnings call).
* **Competitive Landscape:** AEM faces competition from other major gold miners like Barrick Gold, Newmont, and Kinross, as well as smaller producers.  The competitive landscape is global, with mines located across various continents.  AEM differentiates itself by owning high-quality assets in politically stable regions (Q4 2022 earnings call) and through a focus on operational excellence and sustainability (Q1 2023 earnings call).

**Financial Overview**

AEM has generally maintained a healthy balance sheet, with a manageable level of debt.

* **Revenues:**  $6.1 billion in 2022, up from $4.4 billion in 2019
* **Operating margins:** Relatively stable, averaging around 35% in the past three years
* **Return on invested capital (ROIC):**  Has varied significantly based on the fluctuations in Gold prices; AEM's adjusted ROIC (with goodwill) averaged 24% over the last five years
* **Earnings and cash flow:** Strong Free Cash Flows and increased profitability in 2022, partially as a result of incorporating a significant portion of Kirkland Lake Gold revenues (Q4 2022 earnings call)
* **Debt to Equity:** Has risen significantly after the Kirkland Lake Gold acquisition, now being around 0.36, with net debt around $2 billion. (Q1 2023 earnings call).  

**Valuation ($31.1 Billion)**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to estimate the value of AEM.  A conservative approach is taken in forecasting, given the cyclical nature of the gold industry and uncertainties surrounding the Odyssey Project.  

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:**  Modest revenue growth over the next five years, averaging 2.4 percent annually (in line with long-term economic growth).  Revenue will gradually decline for years 6 through 10 to reach stable growth.
* **Margins:**  Margins will also be stable throughout the explicit forecast period and onwards, based on normalized values and expected cost pressures (discussed in Q1 2023 earnings call).
* **Return on Capital (ROIC):** ROIC will remain strong (17% from 2023 and onwards) for a five year explicit period; Declining to terminal rate of 10%.
* **Cost of Capital:**  We will assume 9%, with cost of equity estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with a market risk premium of 4.5 percent and a Beta of 0.81.

**Valuation Calculations:**

* The free cash flow (FCF) to the firm is projected over the next 10 years.
* The terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity growth rate of 2 percent and a cost of capital of 9 percent.
* The present value of the FCF and the terminal value are discounted back to today.
* The value of nonoperating assets (cash, investments) is added.
* The value of debt is subtracted.
* The result is a business-as-usual valuation of $31.1 billion, or $47.17 per share.

**Potential Catalysts (2/5)**

* **Successful ramp-up of the Odyssey project:**  The Odyssey project has the potential to significantly increase AEM's production and cash flow in the long term (Q1 2023 earnings call).  
* **Higher gold prices:**  AEM's profitability is directly tied to gold prices. A sustained increase in gold prices could improve the company's financials and valuation.
* **Further industry consolidation:**  AEM has been an active acquirer in the past. Continued consolidation could create value for shareholders through synergies and improved market share. (Q4 2022 earnings call).


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Cost Inflation:**  AEM has faced rising costs at its Detour Lake mine, which has impacted profitability.  Management is focused on mitigating these cost pressures through operational improvements (Q1 2023 earnings call).
* **Political Risk in Mexico:**  AEM has significant operations in Mexico, which exposes the company to political and regulatory risks. This could include potential changes to mining laws and regulations, as well as security concerns (discussed in *Valuation in Emerging Markets*). However, the recent expansions at the LaRonde Complex are a testament to the management's faith in the country (Q4 2022 earnings call).


{: .warning }

*Note:** This valuation is highly sensitive to changes in gold prices and operating costs.  Given the cyclical nature of the gold market, the company's intrinsic value, and thus our valuation, is subjective and could change significantly with new information.*
