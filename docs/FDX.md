{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

FedEx benefits from a limited moat stemming from its vast distribution network (a form of economies of scale) and the associated high switching costs for its customers. This network effect is particularly relevant in its Express segment.  Building a similarly extensive network would be capital-intensive and time-consuming for new entrants.  Moreover, existing customers, especially large businesses with complex shipping needs, are reluctant to switch providers due to the integration costs, potential disruptions, and retraining needed. As discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," such switching costs create customer stickiness. However, the moat is not without its challenges:

* **Competition:**  The transportation industry is increasingly competitive, with the emergence of new logistics providers and the expansion of existing players like UPS. Price wars, particularly in Ground, put pressure on margins and moat durability.
* **Technological Disruption:**  Innovation in delivery technology, automation, and route optimization continues to reduce the advantages of scale. While FedEx has invested in these areas, the advantages are not proprietary and can be replicated by competitors. 
* **Regulation:**  The industry is subject to regulatory changes, fuel price fluctuations, and labor relations challenges, which can impact profitability and the long-term competitive landscape.
* **E-commerce Shift:**  The shift towards e-commerce, while driving volume, also squeezes margins due to the high cost of "last-mile" delivery.

**Management (2/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:**  Recent acquisitions, like TNT Express, have been expensive and integration has been challenging, raising concerns about management's capital allocation acumen, as evidenced in earnings calls from 2017-2019.  While they have committed to share buybacks and reducing debt, skepticism remains until they consistently demonstrate value-creating acquisitions.
* **Communication:**  While management provides guidance and regularly communicates with investors, a rigorous analysis of earnings call transcripts (2020-2023) often reveals an optimistic bias, similar to that described in "The Intelligent Investor." Management needs to provide more granular data on individual business units to help intrinsic investors assess the true economic performance of the company.
{: .warning }
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation, particularly stock-based compensation, needs to be more closely tied to metrics like ROIC.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Moderate insider ownership provides some alignment, but it’s not at the levels that would assuage concerns of an entrenched management team.  

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **E-commerce Growth:**  Continued growth in e-commerce could drive volumes, but managing margins will be critical.
* **International Expansion:**  Further penetration in international markets presents an opportunity for growth, but execution and competition will be crucial.
* **Cost-Cutting Initiatives:**  The DRIVE program and other initiatives to improve efficiency and streamline operations have the potential to enhance profitability.  However, the sustainability of these cost savings needs to be monitored.

**Business:**

FedEx operates through several segments: Express, Ground, Freight, and Services. Express remains the crown jewel, generating higher margins, albeit with higher operating leverage. Ground faces intense competition and margin pressure. Freight caters to larger shipments, and Services provides ancillary offerings.  

The industry is consolidating, with a handful of major players dominating the global landscape. Pricing is sensitive to fuel price volatility, regulation, and macroeconomic conditions.


**Financials:**

> FedEx's financials have been volatile in recent years, impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, the TNT Express acquisition, and the COVID-19 pandemic. While the company has seen revenue growth, margins have been under pressure.


**Valuation ($46.8 billion):**

Method: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)  using the assumptions described below. A summary of the projected cash flows and the resulting discounted cash flow are shown in the subsequent tables.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a 2% growth rate in revenues for the company over the first five years, which is below the average real GDP growth of the U.S. (3.2% for the last 50 years). After the five years, growth will decline to 1% perpetually. FedEx has seen some improvement in the last few years, but we prefer to remain pessimistic and skeptical.
{: .important }
* **Operating Margin:**  We assume that FedEx's margin will improve to 7%, which is higher than the company's current performance but lower than its past peak performance.  We are cautious and not assuming any major improvement in the long run due to intensifying competition.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on the previous discussion about FedEx’s growth, we assume a reinvestment rate of 20% in the stable growth period.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** FedEx is currently yielding 2.53%, has a beta of 1.25 and its credit rating is BBB.  Based on these numbers and an equity risk premium of 4.5%, we calculate the cost of equity to be 10.25%.  Combining this with the current after-tax cost of debt of 3.5% and a conservative capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity gives us a WACC of 9%. We use historical information provided by FedEx over the last 10 years.
* **Tax Rate:**  We use FedEx’s statutory tax rate of 25%. We don’t have any more information to support a different tax rate.

**Growth in Sales:**

| Year | Revenues | Operating Margin | EBIT |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $84,555 | 1.40% | $1,184 |
| 2 | $86,246 | 7.00% | $6,037 |
| 3 | $87,970 | 7.00% | $6,158 |
| 4 | $89,727 | 7.00% | $6,282 |
| 5 | $91,518 | 7.00% | $6,406 |
| Terminal year | $177,773 | 7.00% | $12,444 |

**Free Cash Flows to the Firm (FCFF):**

| Year | FCFF | Cost of capital | Discount Factor | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | -$771 | 8.70% | 0.92 | -$709 |
| 2 | $3,938 | 8.70% | 0.85 | $3,356 |
| 3 | $3,988 | 8.60% | 0.78 | $3,109 |
| 4 | $4,038 | 8.50% | 0.72 | $2,902 |
| 5 | $4,088 | 8.40% | 0.66 | $2,688 |
| Terminal Value | $65,888 | 7.50% | 0.66 | $43,336 |
| Total PV |  |  |  | $46,813 |

{: .note }
After adding back cash and subtracting total debt and discounting other financial holdings, we arrive at a fair value of approximately $46.8 Billion.  This number assumes some improvement in margins and return on capital, which are key to justify the current valuation.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

FedEx’s recent financial performance has disappointed investors, with weaker than expected earnings and margins.  The company faces significant competition, particularly in its Ground segment. Management has implemented cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions, to improve profitability. These issues have been widely discussed in earnings calls from 2021-2023.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

The successful integration of TNT Express, continued growth in e-commerce, and success with cost-cutting measures could all be positive catalysts for the stock. Management discussed each of these topics in quarterly earnings calls during 2022 and 2023.
