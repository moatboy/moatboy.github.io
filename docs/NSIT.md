{: .note }
**Financial Health**
    *   **Balance Sheet Health:** The company appears to be in a decent financial position with reasonable levels of debt. The working capital management is important for this business. They had $583 million cash and equivalents, $549 million accounts receivable, and $1.4 billion of inventory as of September 30th, 2024
        * There was a $187 million increase in cash and equivalents and restricted cash.

{: .warning }
**Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience:**

*   **Technological Disruption:** Technological advancements can disrupt NSIT's competitive position by rendering current products and services obsolete. It is always important for a company to stay on top of new technologies to remain relevant.
*   **Competitive Industry:** NSIT is competing in a very fragmented market. Therefore, price competition could decrease margins and revenue.
*   **Vendor Dependence:** Insight relies on partnerships with large vendors. A change in these relationships, or a decline in a partner's offerings, could harm profitability.
*   **Economic Cycles:** The performance of NSIT is correlated to the general state of the economy. Economic downturns may reduce demand for its products and services. The recent downturn and concerns about the future are a real problem for NSIT as clients could cut spending.
* **Currency Risk:** International operations expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations. 
* **Acquisitions:** NSIT has used acquisitions to grow and to strengthen product and service portfolio. There is always risk in overpaying or the acquisition not doing what was expected and this has the potential to impact future growth.

**Moat Rating: 2/5**

*  **Narrow Moat:** NSIT possesses a limited economic moat primarily derived from its extensive and established distribution network. This leads to high customer retention. The company's strong partnerships also provide some advantage. However, this is not a truly “wide” moat.
 *  The company operates in a very competitive IT industry. A large and diversified customer base could make them relatively resilient, but there are always competitors who offer similar products and services.
*  The industry does not appear to allow for durable moats, thus the lack of “strong” pricing power and long-term value generation is likely to persist.
* There is no strong evidence that the business has a large source of recurring revenue.
* The company is susceptible to technological disruption, as it may be rendered irrelevant by competitors or the introduction of new technologies.

{: .note }
**Understandability: 3 / 5**

*   The business model is relatively straightforward to understand: providing and integrating IT products and services, but how it does this can get complex when looking into different geographies and client types.
*   The business' financial analysis is complicated by frequent restructuring charges, acquisitions, foreign exchange fluctuations, and adjustments for intangibles, requiring in-depth analysis of the financial statements.
*   Valuing companies like NSIT with a mix of hardware, software, and services can become hard due to the varying profitability dynamics of each segment.

{: .note }
**Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5**

*   Has a decent liquidity position with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of about 300 million dollars.
* They have an inventory financing facility for about $755 million, which means they have a decent capacity for funding operations.
* Debt levels are manageable, and they have the ability to generate free cash flows in excess of their debt payments.
*   Their debt repayment schedule should also be watched in order to determine whether they have enough earnings power to support that.
