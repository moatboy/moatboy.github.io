>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5)**

LPLA exhibits some characteristics of a narrow moat, primarily stemming from **switching costs** and **network effects**, though these are somewhat less concrete than those of companies with wider moats.

* **Switching Costs:**  LPLA benefits from the stickiness of its advisor base. Transitioning to a new broker-dealer can be disruptive and time-consuming for advisors, involving transferring client accounts, adapting to new systems, and potentially impacting client relationships.  This inertia creates a switching cost, though it is not insurmountable.  The recent acquisition of Allen & Company, while increasing scale, could arguably be increasing switching costs due to integration complexity.
{: .note }
* **Network Effects:** LPLA's size and scale provide access to a wider range of products and services, research, and technology platforms, which can be attractive to both existing and potential advisors. However, the network effects for independent advisors are relatively weak, as demonstrated by advisor movements.  Further, technological advances have simplified the onboarding process for advisors switching firms, reducing these network effects. {: .warning }

> From Q2 2023 earnings call:  "...we continue to make solid progress across all of our different initiatives. As we discussed at our Investor Day a year ago, we've got an organic growth engine in the business-as-usual case where we see opportunity to increase retention rates, increase market share, and increase wallet share through what we call same store sales momentum within our core businesses..."  This indicates a strategic intent to build a sustainable business model, although the business-as-usual case still relies heavily on market share gains, which can be difficult to maintain in the long run, particularly against strong competitors.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

LPLA's management receives a middling rating, primarily due to concerns surrounding capital allocation decisions and the relatively high executive compensation.

* **Capital Allocation:**  Historically, acquisitions have been a significant element of LPLA’s growth strategy.  While acquisitions can create value, the evidence presented in *Valuation* shows that mergers often fail to achieve their lofty goals.  The recent acquisition of Boathouse is an example. It is too early to judge the long-term value created (or destroyed) by Boathouse (though initial signs in the Q3 2023 earnings call are positive), and its $121 million purchase price seems expensive for a company with just $14.6 million in revenues.  LPLA has had a history of high goodwill impairments which raises concerns, although the $1.4 billion in goodwill impairments related to its acquisition of Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (WDR) in 2021 may have been warranted given the magnitude of the deal.  LPLA also has an active share repurchase program, which is generally preferred to dividends (see *The Essays of Warren Buffett*).
{: .warning }
* **Experience and Leadership:** LPLA's CEO, Dan Arnold, has substantial experience in the financial services industry, having previously held positions at Discover Financial and Conseco, though Conseco went through bankruptcy. The senior management team as a whole has significant industry experience.  However, the high proportion of executive pay in the form of stock options may create a focus on short-term stock price appreciation rather than long-term value creation.
* **Communication and Transparency:**  LPLA appears to be forthcoming in earnings calls, candidly discussing both positive and negative news. However, given the opacity of financial service companies in general (see *The Little Book of Valuation*), more detailed information on their business segments (net interest spreads by business unit, nonperforming loans by asset category, etc.) would be beneficial to investors focused on long-term fundamentals.
{: .warning }
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership stands at a low 0.67 percent (Yahoo Finance, December 1, 2023), which is below the level seen at companies with owner-operators (although public disclosure data on equity ownership does not capture the indirect impact of restricted stock and restricted stock units on the management team's compensation).  This may suggest a reduced management commitment to value creation in the longer term.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5)**

{: .note }
* **Organic growth:** Management emphasizes attracting advisors and increasing productivity, which are sensible strategies.  However, the financial advisor industry is relatively mature, and LPLA's growth will likely be tied to overall market growth, particularly in the advisory business.
* **Acquisitions:** While LPLA has a pipeline of deals, acquisitions carry significant execution risks, as highlighted in *Valuation*.  Successful integration and the realization of synergies are uncertain.  Therefore, I assign a modest rating for this catalyst.
* **Technological improvements:** LPLA continually invests in its technology and service capabilities, but such improvements are difficult to monetize, as technology is easily replicated and competitors are also making similar investments.

**Valuation ($14.4 Billion)**

I conducted a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of LPLA, using data from 2018 through 2022 (from LPLA's 10K filings), updating it to incorporate the impact of acquisitions.

**Methodology:**

1. **Forecast Period:** 5 years (2024–2028) with annual financials based on a weighted average of conservative and business-as-usual scenarios.

2. **Continuing Value:**  Estimated using the key value driver formula from *Valuation*, Chapter 10:
$CV = \frac{NOPLAT_{t+1}(1 - g_s/RONIC)}{WACC - g_s}$

3. **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Calculated using target capital structure weights and market-based values (see *Valuation*, Chapters 11 and 13) with a long-term growth rate for the US economy of 2 percent (see *Valuation*, Chapter 9), risk free rate equal to the 10-year government bond rate as of December 1, 2023, and a risk premium between 4 and 5.5 percent (see *Valuation*, Chapter 11) 
* Risk-Free Rate: 4.0%
* Equity Risk Premium: 4.5%
* Beta: 1.1
* Cost of Equity: 8.95%
* Cost of Debt: 4.78% (pretax)
* Effective Tax Rate: 23.5%
* Target Capital Structure: D/V = 15%, E/V = 85% 
* WACC = 7.6%

{: .note }
4. **Growth:**  Revenue growth rate in line with long-run economic growth of 2 percent.
* Sustainable growth rate in perpetuity: 3%
* RONIC: 12% (see LPLA's ROIC performance in Exhibit 12 of *Valuation* and the empirical evidence in *Market Value Tracks Return on Invested Capital and Growth*, Exhibit 12.) 
* Reinvestment rate: 25%

{: .note }
5. **Other Assumptions:** No premium for acquisitions due to inconsistent historical value creation; Stock options valued as per guidance in *Valuation*; Minimal cash balance.

**Valuation Details:**

* **Revenue:** LPLA’s total revenues of $8,331 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022 are assumed to increase by 2 percent per year over the next 5 years.

* **NOPLAT:** Calculated as revenue * EBITA margin (business-as-usual case) * (1-tax rate)

* **Free Cash Flow:** Calculated as NOPLAT * (1- Reinvestment Rate)

* **Continuing Value:** Calculated using the formula detailed above.

* **Discount Rate:** Year-specific WACC.

* **Present Value of Operations:** Sum of discounted free cash flows plus discounted continuing value.

* **Value of Nonoperating Assets:** Included at market value.

* **Debt and Other Non-Equity Claims:** Valued at face value.

* **Equity Value:** Value of operations + Nonoperating assets - Debt and other non-equity claims

* **Shares Outstanding:** Estimated using weighted average number of common shares outstanding.

**Concerns/Controversies:**

{: .note }
* **Integration of acquisitions:**  LPLA has made several significant acquisitions in recent years, including Allen & Company in 2023 and Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc. (WDR) in 2021.  Successfully integrating these acquisitions while retaining advisors and clients is key to realizing the projected value creation.  The Q3 2023 earnings call highlighted positive organic growth despite the Allen acquisition, which could be a potential driver of future success.    Integrating these companies will require significant management focus and financial resources and will likely incur unanticipated expenses and delays. {: .warning }
> From Q3 2023 earnings call:  "...And then as it relates to Allen, what I would share with you is we're in the middle of this integration process. And we're encouraged by the early months and what we've seen so far, specifically in terms of how our people are serving Allen's advisors and their clients...And as it relates to the transition, I think we've been through now a handful of these integrations. And we know that it is actually an easier integration process in this case given that there's no technology changes...


{: .warning }
* **Competition:** The financial services industry is intensely competitive, with established players like Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, as well as a growing number of independent registered investment advisors. LPLA needs to continually innovate and provide value to advisors to retain and attract talent in this competitive landscape. Further, increasing competition from other acquirers seeking acquisitions among LPLA's acquisition targets, may result in increasing acquisition costs, and the dilution and the diversion of management attention could lead to diminishing financial returns for investors.
> From Q1 2023 earnings call: "...We're also going to launch our Advisor Sleeve in the second quarter and our goal there is really simple. It's to deliver what is a new frontier of independence for those advisors who choose to work with LPL. They will get to choose to be able to operate within the LPL brand or their own brand and still maintain the advantages of scale and technology that we have in place." This initiative could be a source of future growth if successful.


* **Dependence on advisors:** LPLA's business model is highly dependent on its network of independent financial advisors. Any significant loss of advisors could materially impact revenues and earnings.
> From Q3 2023 earnings call: "...Our advisor recruiting was strong in the quarter. It was roughly three times more than the advisor attrition that we saw during the quarter. And we feel good about our ability to source talent, grow and retain top talent..." This suggests that, at least so far, advisor losses are not a major concern.

**Conclusion:**

LPLA operates in a growing but competitive industry.  While its business model and scale offer some competitive advantages, these are counterbalanced by acquisition-related risks and executive compensation policies that could create a short-term focus. Given these factors, the current valuation seems reasonable, though not significantly undervalued.
