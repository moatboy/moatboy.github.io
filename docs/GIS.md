General Mills operates in a highly competitive industry. Its brand portfolio, while well-known, does not imbue significant pricing power in most categories. Brand loyalty, a key component of moat strength, is eroding due to the rise of private label brands and increased consumer price sensitivity. Consequently, General Mills’ moat is narrow, rating a 2 out of 5.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



Management receives a middling rating of 3 out of 5.  While generally competent, they haven't demonstrated exceptional capital allocation skills. Their expansion into adjacent categories has yielded mixed results, and they've been slow to adapt to shifting consumer preferences. Share repurchases have been a mixed bag, sometimes executed at seemingly inflated prices. Insider ownership is moderate, and communication, while satisfactory, lacks the candor and depth found in truly owner-oriented companies like Berkshire Hathaway (as discussed in "The Essays of Warren Buffett").  Specifically, management's focus on short-term earnings and EPS, rather than long-term value creation through ROIC and growth, raises concerns.  As Michael Burry often does, we should be wary of accounting gimmicks, and General Mills has a history of adjusting earnings for "one-time" charges, which are often neither one-time nor truly extraordinary.


Catalyst rating is a 2 out of 5.  General Mills’ near-term prospects are heavily dependent on the overall economic environment and its ability to effectively manage input costs. While cost pressures appear to be easing, the company faces a challenging macroeconomic outlook.  There are no obvious imminent catalysts for substantial share-price appreciation. However, potential for improved profit margins due to eased cost pressures is possible.

### Business Overview

General Mills is a leading manufacturer and marketer of packaged consumer foods.  Its largest segment is North America Retail, generating roughly 62% of total revenue in 2023 (GM 2023 10K).  Other business segments include Pet (Blue Buffalo), Convenience & Foodservice, and International.

{: .note }
* **Revenue Distribution:** General Mills' revenue is geographically diversified across North America, Europe & Australia, and Asia & Latin America.  However, North America Retail remains the company's primary market. Within its product portfolio, cereal, snacks, yogurt, and pet food are its largest contributors.
{: .important }
* **Industry Trends:** The packaged food industry is highly competitive, with intense competition from private-label brands.  Consumers are increasingly price-conscious, and this trend is expected to continue. Health and wellness are also becoming increasingly important drivers of consumer behavior in the food industry.
{: .warning }
* **Margins:** General Mills’ gross and operating margins are below those of its peers. This reflects the company’s lack of pricing power and the commodity nature of many of its products.
{: .important }
* **Competitive Landscape:**  General Mills faces competition from both large multinational companies (e.g., Kellogg, PepsiCo) and smaller, niche players.  Its competitive advantage primarily stems from its established brands, albeit with diminishing returns.
{: .note }
* **Differentiation:**  Many of General Mills’ products are undifferentiated commodities, making it difficult for the company to charge a premium price.  However, it has some premium brands like Blue Buffalo pet food and Annie’s organic foods.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**  General Mills, like other food companies, has been significantly impacted by rising input costs.  The company has attempted to mitigate the impact of these cost pressures by raising prices, but this has been met with consumer resistance, further hindering volume growth.  (Q4 2023 Earnings Call)

### Financial Analysis

{: .important }
* **Revenue:** General Mills’ revenue growth has been anemic in recent years, primarily due to volume declines and increased competition. This sluggish growth, combined with declining margins, has put pressure on profits and returns.  (GM 2023 10K)
{: .warning }
* **Profitability:**  General Mills’ profitability has deteriorated over the last five years, with both its gross and operating margins declining.  This is primarily due to cost pressures and pricing competition.  (GM 2023 10K)
{: .important }
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**  General Mills' ROIC has historically been above its cost of capital, but the spread has narrowed in recent years due to the decline in profitability.  As the analysis in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies" suggests, the narrowing spread between ROIC and cost of capital indicates declining value creation.
{: .warning }
* **Capital Allocation:**  General Mills has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  However, their capital allocation decisions haven't consistently created value.  Specifically, share repurchases executed during periods of high valuation have destroyed value. (GM 2023 10K)

### Valuation

To determine a fair value for General Mills, we will employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. This model forecasts future cash flows and discounts them back to the present value at an appropriate discount rate.  Because of the company's mature status and the challenging macroeconomic outlook, we will adopt a pessimistic outlook in our assumptions.


**Key Valuation Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Period:** 10 years. Justification: DCF valuation focuses on long-term value and a 10-year forecast period is typically sufficient. Longer forecast periods increase the difficulty of making realistic assumptions.
2. **Revenue Growth:**  2% for the next 5 years and 1% thereafter. Justification: General Mills operates in a mature industry with limited growth potential. Intense competition, private label growth, and changing consumer preferences limit its ability to increase its sales significantly.
3. **Operating Margin:**  17% in stable growth. Justification: General Mills’ margins have been declining, and there is no clear catalyst for a sustained rebound. We are pessimistic about the company's ability to expand margins in the current competitive environment.
4. **Sales-to-Capital Ratio:** 2.5. Justification:  Stable for the industry.
5. **Reinvestment Rate:** 31.9%. Justification: Derived by dividing revenue growth by return on invested capital, as shown in the "Valuation" book. This is done below
     Reinvestment Rate = (Growth Rate) / (ROIC)
     Reinvestment Rate = (1%) / (17.1%)
     Reinvestment Rate = 31.9%
6. **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 8% Justification: Based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4%, a beta of 0.6, a cost of debt of 4.5%, and a target capital structure of 30% debt and 70% equity. This is a blended rate representing the cost of both debt and equity financing, and it is used to discount the cash flows.  The calculation is provided below:
     Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
     Cost of Equity = 4% + 0.6*4%
     Cost of Equity = 6.4%
     Cost of Debt = 4.5%
     WACC = (Cost of Equity \* (Equity/Total Capital)) + (Cost of Debt \* (Debt/Total Capital) \* (1-Tax Rate))
     WACC = (6.4%\*0.7) + (4.5%\*0.3*(1-0.25))
     WACC = 7.955% or rounded to 8%
{: .important }
7. **Terminal Value:** Perpetuity with 1% growth. Justification:  Consistent with our long-term growth assumption and a conservative estimate for a mature company in a competitive industry.

**DCF Valuation Table:**

| Year | FCF (in $ billions) | Terminal Value | PV of FCF (in $ billions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3.32 |  | $3.06 |
| 2 | $3.40 |  | $2.88 |
| 3 | $3.48 |  | $2.72 |
| 4 | $3.56 |  | $2.57 |
| 5 | $3.65 |  | $2.43 |
| 6 | $3.74 |  | $2.30 |
| 7 | $3.83 |  | $2.17 |
| 8 | $3.93 |  | $2.05 |
| 9 | $4.03 |  | $1.93 |
| 10 | $4.13 | $49.30 | $1.82 |
| Terminal Value |  |  | $28.02 |
| **Total Enterprise Value (in $ billions)** |  |  | **$47.95** |

{: .highlight }

Deducting cash, minority interests, and nonoperating assets from, and adding debt to, the enterprise value yields the total value of equity. Dividing the equity value by the shares outstanding yields the equity value per share. This discounted cash flow (DCF) yields a total value of equity for General Mills of \$48.06 billion.
