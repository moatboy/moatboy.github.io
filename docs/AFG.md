**Moat Analysis:**
AFG's moat is assessed as narrow, with sources of competitive advantage.
* **Intangible Assets:** AFG relies somewhat on brand recognition, especially in specialty niches such as American Financial Group, Great American and National Interstate, but this brand strength is limited due to insurance being based more on price and coverage.
* **Switching Costs:** The nature of insurance coverage creates some friction to changing insurers, as customers build relationships, learn processes, and develop certain preferences for providers.
* **Cost Advantages:** AFG has some advantage with their specialty business by using technology to streamline claims processes and underwrite business more effectively, but this is easily replicable, and they do not have the economies of scale a larger insurer might have.
*  **Network Effects**: AFG doesn't benefit from network effects.

**Moat Rating: 2/5**

**Risks That Can Harm the Moat:**
*   **Competition**: Intense competition in the insurance industry could pressure premium pricing.
*   **Technological Disruption**: New insurtech models could erode switching costs that make companies less sticky.
*   **Regulatory Changes**: Evolving insurance regulations or government policy may pose a threat.
*   **Catastrophic Events**: More frequent and severe losses will negatively affect profitability.
* **Interest Rate Changes:** An increase in interest rates can reduce the value of bonds held and could impact overall profitability. 

{: .note }
**Business Resilience:**
   *  The nature of insurance, with a broad mix of geographical areas and policies, offers a degree of stability.
    * Management has a strong track record and focuses on profitability over growth.
   *  AFG's focus on specialty insurance reduces the risk associated with commoditization of core products. 

**Understandability Rating: 4/5**

The business is relatively straightforward to understand as it involves a wide variety of insurance products, however, with special focuses on different sectors of the economy. However, there are some unique elements in how they do business, such as the reliance on niche and specialty markets, that make the business somewhat difficult to fully comprehend.

   *  It holds large amounts of unassigned and available capital, providing flexibility.
    *The credit ratings were also generally in the single A rating or above.
