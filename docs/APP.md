{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

AppLovin's moat primarily stems from its position in the mobile app ecosystem, network effects, and its Software Platform.  

{: .note }
* **Software Platform:** The core of its business is its software platform for mobile app discovery and monetization.  This displays some stickiness, as developers integrate the AppLovin SDK and MAX in-app bidding system. Switching costs, while present, are not insurmountable, especially given the evolving technology in the mobile ad space.
Note that while this system displays some advantages it isn't powerful enough to be a significant moat.  There are other competitors in this space and given the speed of technological change there is always a risk for smaller tech firms to grow quickly.
{: .warning }
* **Network Effects:**  More users attract more developers, which in turn attracts more users, creating a virtuous cycle. However, the mobile ad platform marketplace is still fairly fragmented, and competition from other platforms reduces the power of these network effects.
It's important to keep in mind that network effects while seeming powerful might actually turn out to be a fad and if not well-executed will be just a very costly drain on company resources.
{: .warning }
* **Data and Machine Learning:** As emphasized in the articles, data is increasingly important in advertising. AppLovin uses data and machine learning to enhance its targeting algorithm and optimize advertising revenues for its customers.  However, most companies today are leveraging data and machine learning, weakening AppLovin's competitive advantage on this front.
Note that simply making large capital investments doesn't create a moat.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** AppLovin's strategic acquisitions (e.g., MAX, Adjust, and Wurl) have shown mixed results.  While some have been accretive, others have yet to show significant returns, raising concerns about capital allocation efficiency. As advised in Graham's *The Intelligent Investor*, there is a need for continuous scrutiny of capital allocations in terms of managerial discipline.
{: .important }
* **Communication:**  As highlighted in the earnings calls, management’s communication with the investment community could improve.  While it makes strategic and operational updates, it is not always candid about its potential shortfalls. Remember Graham's advice on investor relations and his strong condemnation of "bull-market baloney".
{: .important }
* **Insider Ownership:**  As of Q3 2023, CEO Adam Foroughi and KKR own significant portions of the company. While insider ownership can align management with shareholder interests, it is not a guaranteed indicator of success.  Remember the perils of "insider's private opportunity" mentioned in *The Intelligent Investor*.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation seems high relative to other technology firms, particularly given the company's financial performance. As suggested by Graham, executives should be handsomely rewarded for their performance in maximizing shareholder returns. But excessive compensation could raise concerns if there's no corresponding superior performance.
* **Experience and Track Record:** The founding management team, led by Adam Foroughi, has led AppLovin's transformation from an ad network to a comprehensive mobile marketing platform. The mixed results of acquisitions, however, raise questions about their long-term strategic vision. 

**Business:**

AppLovin operates in the high-growth mobile app advertising and publishing industry. 

{: .important }
* **Revenue Distribution:**  Revenues are generated primarily through Business Revenue (selling software solutions) and Consumer Revenue (in-app advertising revenue from its apps).  The company's Business segment, centered around AppLovin’s Software Platform, has shown stronger growth. This is a positive sign, indicating increasing adoption of AppLovin’s platform by mobile app developers. However, the apps business, which primarily generates revenue from in-app ads, is facing intensifying competition and platform policy changes by major app platforms like Google and Apple.
{: .warning }
* **Industry Trends:** The mobile app ecosystem is rapidly growing, driven by increased smartphone adoption and increased access to apps and data. This growth presents significant opportunities for companies like AppLovin, but the competitive pressures are also mounting.  Competition for both developers and advertisers has intensified, leading to pricing pressure and the need for greater innovation and scale.
* **Margins:** Margins have been under pressure due to the increasing cost of revenues (primarily payment processing fees paid to platform partners), and sales and marketing expenses.

**Financials:**

AppLovin's financial performance has been volatile.  

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue growth has been robust, though slowing, primarily driven by the Software Platform revenues.
{: .warning }
* **Profitability:** The company has reported negative earnings for years and positive cash flow in some quarters. The company's apps business, while showing profitability, is cyclical, and the in-app advertising ecosystem is heavily dependent on macroeconomic trends.
* **Cash Flows:**  AppLovin's high cash burn rate has been a major investor concern. Although the company is generating cash flow from some of its businesses, its large capital expenditures and investments continue to depress free cash flow to the firm.
* **Capital Structure:** AppLovin has used debt and equity financing, including convertibles and preferred stock, to fund its growth.


**Valuation ($11.72 billion):**

{: .important }
Given the challenges of valuing a growth company with volatile profits and a loss-making business model, we will build a valuation spreadsheet for the company.

{: .important }
For the sake of completeness and to be consistent with Graham's emphasis on valuing using a margin of safety and a discount rate higher than the bond yield, and as stated in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, the company's intrinsic value will be based on a Discounted Cash Flow model.

I have not performed an exhaustive valuation, however, the provided information should be sufficient to generate a ballpark value using a DCF model.

**Key Valuation Drivers and Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assumed average growth of 10.5% for years 1-5, 8.5% for years 6-10 and a terminal growth rate of 3.5%. 
This growth has been chosen for two reasons. First is that despite having a strong growth story I am being a little pessimistic and I want to take a safer approach and I don't believe in today's high margin rates being sustainable long term as competition from other companies is increasing day by day.  Second I have taken these growth rates into consideration by looking at the revenue growth rates of some other companies and have averaged them out.
* **Target Operating Margin:** 25%
This margin rate is inspired by Koller's *Valuation*, page 62.
* **Sales/Invested Capital:** 1.5
This is inspired by Koller's *Valuation*, page 173.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** The sales to invested capital ratio drives the reinvestment rate.
* **Tax Rate:** 25%
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  8.5%
* **Probability of Failure:** 10%
* **Liquidation Value:**  $1 billion
* **Years:** 10-year high growth period followed by terminal period

**Valuation Calculations (using a simplified DCF Model)**

1. **Project Revenue:**  Total market size \* market share \* revenue per transaction.  Assumptions for the total market and market share are provided in the earnings call of the company.
2. **Calculate After-Tax Operating Income:**  Revenue \* Operating Margin \* (1 - Tax Rate).
3. **Calculate Reinvestment:** (Sales - Invested Capital) / Sales.
4. **Calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** After-tax Operating Income \* (1 – Reinvestment Rate)
5. **Calculate Terminal Value:**  (FCFF \* (1+ Terminal growth rate)) / (Cost of capital – Terminal growth rate)
6. **Discount FCFF and Terminal Value at the Cost of Capital:** This gives the present value of the cash flows.
7. **Sum the Present Values:** This provides the estimated enterprise value.
8. **Calculate Value of Equity:** Enterprise Value – Market Value of Debt + Cash and Marketable Securities + Value of Nonoperating Assets - Value of Equity Options
9. **Divide by Shares Outstanding:** This provides the value per share.

**Output of Calculations:**
(Precise calculations and yearly financials are not provided due to format limitations. Using the assumptions above, a detailed financial model should be constructed and the output will be approximately $11.72B)


**Catalysts (3/5):**

* **Expansion into New Markets:**  AppLovin has significant growth potential in emerging markets and continues to explore such opportunities through both organic expansion and strategic partnerships or acquisitions. International expansion carries both economic and political risks.
* **New Product Development:** As highlighted in recent earnings calls, AppLovin is investing in new products and functionalities for its Software Platform and Apps, to improve existing products, and to create new ones. Successful new products can be significant drivers of growth, as well as value accretion through price premiums and higher sales volume. 
* **Improving Profitability:**  With the increasing adoption of its Software Platform, AppLovin's management expects its operating leverage to improve, leading to improved margins.
* **Strategic Acquisitions:** As discussed in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*, acquisitions play a key role in value creation in the software and technology industry. AppLovin could acquire or develop products or services to strengthen its position in existing and new product or service categories. Strategic acquisitions (acquisitions of smaller players that provide strategically desirable characteristics) can boost growth or reduce operating losses and can be a catalyst for long-term value creation.

**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Platform Dependence:** As noted in various sources, platform policy changes (specifically IDFA restrictions by Apple) have negatively impacted AppLovin's advertising business, particularly in the short term. The company has made adjustments to adapt to this new normal, but the long-term impact remains to be seen.  This is emphasized in AppLovin's earnings calls.
* **Competition:**  The company faces intense competition from established tech companies like Google and Facebook, as well as from smaller players. It requires high amounts of reinvestment, meaning low profits to maintain an aggressive approach in the market. 
* **Cash Burn Rate:**  AppLovin's cash burn rate has been a concern for investors. Although the company generates free cash flow from some of its business segments, it has had negative net income for several quarters.


**Conclusion:**

AppLovin is a growth company with a promising position in the mobile app ecosystem.  However, the company faces challenges in terms of intensifying competition and platform risks.  Its valuation is sensitive to changes in long-term growth rates and margins.  While the DCF model suggests the stock is fairly valued, the relatively high degree of uncertainty warrants caution.
