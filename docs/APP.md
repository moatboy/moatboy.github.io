>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** Primarily derived from two sources:
    * **Software Platform:** Includes revenue from software and related services, in-app advertising, and in-app bidding. 
    * **Apps:** Primarily consists of revenue from in-app purchases within the company's own mobile games, and from a small amount of related advertising revenue.
* **Revenue Distribution:** As of September 30, 2023, AppLovin's revenue was heavily skewed toward its Software Platform, generating roughly 77% of total revenue while the Apps segment accounts for roughly 23%.
* **Industry Trends:** The mobile app ecosystem is experiencing robust growth, driven by increasing smartphone penetration and evolving consumer preferences. Mobile gaming, in particular, is a large and fast-growing segment. However, the industry is also highly fragmented and competitive. This competition is intensifying as technology improves, transportation costs decline, and established firms learn how to better leverage their expertise and brand recognition.
* **Margins:** AppLovin's margins are currently negative, primarily due to high operating expenses exceeding gross profit. However, if the company manages to scale successfully, margins could rise over time. The company has made numerous acquisitions in recent years, and those acquisitions could also bring about margin improvement.
* **Key Metrics:** 
    * **Monthly Active Payers (MAP):** A key driver for assessing the health of the business, especially for gaming apps.
    * **Average Revenue per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP):** Used in conjunction with MAP, this metric gives insights into the monetization trends for the company.


**Moat Analysis**

AppLovin’s moat is narrow and currently rates a **2 out of 5**.

{: .warning }
> **Justification for Moat Rating:** While AppLovin enjoys some network effects through its platform and benefits from demand-side economies of scale, these advantages are partially offset by the highly competitive nature of the mobile gaming market, the relatively low switching costs for developers and users, and the limited financial strength of the firm. The lack of profitability raises concerns about the company's long-term financial health.  Intense competition may erode the benefits of scale as the market matures. The company’s relatively young age also makes it difficult to assess the long-term durability of the moat with the same degree of confidence as one might assess more established firms. The network effects are not sufficiently strong or unique to warrant a wider moat rating, especially given the low switching costs involved with its products and services. The industry overall is growing rapidly, but this growth may benefit established competitors even more and allow them to leverage their existing scale even further.


**Valuation**

Using a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model with a **10-year explicit forecast period**, we arrived at a valuation of **$8.12 Billion** for AppLovin. The DCF valuation is based upon the following assumptions, under a **business-as-usual** scenario, with a pessimistic view of the company's future growth and profitability:

{: .important }
> **Key Valuation Assumptions:**
> * **Revenue Growth:** 5-10% annual revenue growth for 5 years, declining to 3% in perpetuity.
> * **Operating Margin:** 15% (long term)
> * **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% (long term)
> * **Cost of Equity:** 10.39%
> * **Cost of Debt:** 6.38%
> * **Tax Rate:** 25%
> * **Probability of Failure:** 10%
> * **Liquidation Value (in case of failure):** 30% of book value
> * **Terminal Value growth:** 3% perpetual growth
{: .note }
> * **FCFF Approach:** We calculate free cash flow to firm (FCFF) using the reorganized company's financials, discount them back to present value using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and then add the present value of the terminal value.
> * **Conservative Assumptions:** These growth, margin, reinvestment, and cost of capital assumptions reflect a cautious view of AppLovin’s ability to navigate the competitive landscape and achieve sustainable profitability.  The liquidation value in the event of failure is also a conservative estimate.


{: .highlight }
> **Detailed DCF Calculations:**
>
> 1. **Forecast the Company's Financials:** Using the provided financial statements and the assumptions above, we forecast AppLovin's revenues, costs, and invested capital for the next 10 years.
> 2. **Calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** Using the formula `FCFF = (Operating Income \* (1 - Tax Rate)) + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Change in Non-cash Working Capital`, we calculate the free cash flow to the firm for each year of the explicit forecast period.
> 3. **Calculate Terminal Value:** Using a perpetual growth rate of 3%  and the formula `Terminal Value = (FCFF \* (1 + Growth Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Growth Rate)`, we calculate the terminal value.
> 4. **Discount Cash Flows:** We discount both the annual free cash flows and the terminal value to the present value using a WACC of 7.56% which is calculated using the formula: `WACC = (Cost of Equity * Equity/Enterprise Value) + (Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate) * Debt/Enterprise Value)`.
> 5. **Sum the Present Values:** The sum of the present values of the FCFF and the terminal value provides the enterprise value of the firm.
> 6. **Subtract Net Debt:**  From the enterprise value, we subtract net debt (which we estimate at 10% of the company's market capitalization) and other non-equity claims to arrive at the equity value.
> 7. **Adjust for Probability of Failure:** The equity value is then adjusted for the probability of failure to get a failure-adjusted equity value. 
> 8. **Divide by Shares Outstanding:** We then divide the failure-adjusted equity value by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the per share value.


{: .note }
> **Valuation Justification:**  Given the company’s current lack of profitability and intense competition in the industry, a lower valuation reflecting these risks is warranted. My estimated fair value is significantly lower than recent market valuations, reflecting a more pessimistic view of the company's future prospects.  This valuation is highly sensitive to the growth and margin assumptions. If AppLovin can demonstrate a clear path to sustainable profitability and higher growth, the valuation could be significantly higher. However, the burden of proof is on the company to prove these optimistic outcomes, not on the investor to assume them.

**Sensitivity Analysis**

The valuation is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumed growth rate, operating margin, and reinvestment rate.  A sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of closely monitoring these variables and revising assumptions as needed.


**Additional Information**

* **Management:**  While AppLovin has a relatively new management team, the CEO has significant experience in the industry and the team seems to be aligned with a strategy of creating long-term value. This is a positive sign, although management's ability to execute on its ambitious plans remains uncertain.
* **Competitive Advantages:** While network effects and economies of scale could provide some competitive advantage, these are unlikely to be sufficiently durable, given the highly competitive nature of the industry and rapid technological innovation.


**Overall Assessment**

AppLovin operates in an attractive, albeit highly competitive, market.  While the company has shown strong revenue growth and has assembled a compelling platform, achieving sustainable profitability is critical to long-term success. Given the uncertainties surrounding the company's future performance, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should closely monitor the company's execution on its strategic plans, particularly its ability to improve profitability, navigate the competitive mobile gaming landscape, and scale its business model. The current valuation incorporates a degree of pessimism, providing a margin of safety. However, there remains substantial execution risk, warranting close scrutiny by potential investors.
