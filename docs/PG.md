>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

P&G operates on a global scale, selling its products in virtually every country around the world. Its brand portfolio includes iconic names like Gillette, Tide, Pampers, Crest, Olay, and many others. This vast brand portfolio allows the company to cater to a wide range of consumer needs across different demographics and geographies.

P&G’s primary competitive advantage comes from its **intangible assets**, specifically its brands. These brands have been built and nurtured over decades, giving P&G significant **pricing power** and **customer loyalty**.  Additionally, P&G leverages economies of scale through its **massive distribution network** and **cost advantages** stemming from its size and global reach. This enables the company to efficiently bring products to market and gain access to low-cost manufacturing across the globe.

**Moat Analysis**

P&G earns a moat rating of 4/5 due to its combination of **strong brands** and **cost advantages**.  

* **Intangible Assets (Brands):** P&G’s brands are a powerful source of competitive advantage. Many of these brands are household names, and consumers are often willing to pay a premium for the perceived quality and reliability. This brand loyalty gives P&G a degree of pricing power that most competitors lack. For example, Tide laundry detergent regularly commands a higher price than store brands, even though there is little evidence to support the assertion that Tide is demonstrably superior. This pricing power is a classic manifestation of a brand-based moat. However, the proliferation of brands and an increasing consumer emphasis on value can pose a threat to P&G's moat. Competition from private-label and smaller, niche brands is increasing.  While unlikely to dethrone P&G entirely, these competitors can erode market share and pricing power over time.
* **Cost Advantages:** P&G’s scale and global reach provide it with cost advantages in manufacturing, distribution, and marketing. This allows the company to offer its products at competitive prices while maintaining healthy margins. It also creates a significant barrier to entry for new competitors, as it would be very difficult and expensive to replicate P&G’s infrastructure.

**Why Not a 5/5 Moat?**

While P&G's brands and cost advantages create a substantial competitive advantage, there are some factors that prevent a 5/5 moat rating:

* **Evolving Consumer Preferences:**  Consumer tastes and preferences are constantly evolving, which may lead to brand decay. P&G must continually innovate and adapt to stay ahead of these changes.
* **Private Label Competition:**  The increasing quality and market share of private label and smaller brands put downward pressure on P&G's pricing power.
* **Disruption:**  While unlikely in the near term, a truly disruptive product or technology could weaken P&G’s competitive advantages.


**Valuation**

Arriving at a fair value estimate for P&G requires cautious consideration of its steady but potentially slowing growth and mature business characteristics. Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with conservative assumptions, we estimate P&G's fair value to be approximately $330 billion.

**Assumptions & Calculations:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a conservative long-term revenue growth rate of 2 percent, slightly below the historical average of the past decade. We believe this reflects the mature nature of P&G's business and potential headwinds to growth.
* **Operating Margin:** We expect operating margins to stabilize in the mid-teens, reflecting continued pressure from competitors. We recognize management’s focus on cost controls, but we maintain a degree of pessimism given the highly competitive landscape.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 10 percent, in line with the company’s historical average. This reinvestment is necessary to maintain its brands and distribution network.
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimate P&G’s cost of capital to be 7.56 percent. This was computed using the weighted average cost of capital using the May 2009 data (for a detailed discussion, see the The Little Book of Valuation).  
* **Terminal Value:**  Given the maturity of the business, we will use a terminal growth rate of 2 percent in conjunction with the terminal value calculation (for detailed discussion and derivations see, Valuation by McKinsey)


**Conclusion**

P&G is a high-quality business with a wide economic moat.  However, a fair valuation is crucial for a successful investment. Given the company's current stock price and a conservative outlook for future growth, we believe the shares are fairly valued at our estimated $330 billion, which offers a small margin of safety at its current share price.

**Caveats:**

* Valuations are always imprecise, and the actual future may differ substantially from the projections.
* DCF models are sensitive to assumptions about long-term growth, so our fair value estimate should be viewed as a range rather than a precise figure.
* It is important to regularly review the company’s competitive position and adapt your valuation as necessary.

**Additional Notes:**

*  As discussed in *The Intelligent Investor* and *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*, it is important to be wary of mistaking past results for future performance and of overestimating management competence, even if the company has impressive current results.
* *The Little Book of Valuation* highlights the importance of understanding the underlying business and thinking strategically about drivers of revenue, earnings, cash flows, reinvestment, and risk when valuing a company and comparing with peers.  It also provides a framework for thinking about the business life cycle, industry analysis, and competitive dynamics, all of which are crucial elements in valuing a mature company like P&G.
* *The Little Book that Builds Wealth* emphasizes identifying companies with moats—sustainable competitive advantages that protect the company from competition. P&G's brand portfolio and cost advantages qualify as sources of a durable competitive advantage, which positions the company well for long-term value creation.

The provided excerpts from the *Proctor & Gamble 10-Q and 10-K reports* from September 2019 to June 2021 were used to generate the above valuation. Please note that the financials are complex and there is often significant variation in the presentation of results across firms. Consequently, the above valuation should be viewed as an approximation. Additional information concerning other time periods, currency effects, and other subsidiaries is likely to be very helpful in refining the valuation.
