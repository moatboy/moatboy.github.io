## Procter & Gamble (PG) | Moat: 3 / 5 | Understandability: 2 / 5 | Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5

### Business Overview

Procter & Gamble (PG) is a global consumer goods behemoth, managing a diverse portfolio of well-known brands. They operate primarily in three core segments, each catering to specific consumer needs:
   1. **Beauty:** This segment offers a wide array of products, including skincare (such as Olay), hair care (like Pantene and Head & Shoulders), and cosmetics (such as Covergirl).
   2. **Grooming:** This division focuses on products like razors (Gillette), blades, and other shaving-related items for both men and women.
   3. **Fabric & Home Care:** This segment includes fabric care products (like Tide and Downy), home care items (such as Mr. Clean and Dawn), and air care products.
   4. **Health Care:** This segment markets oral care brands (Crest and Oral-B), cough and cold medications, and personal health care products such as Vicks and Metamucil.
   5.  **Baby, Feminine & Family Care:** This division produces baby care products (such as Pampers), feminine care products (like Always and Tampax) and adult care products.

**Geographic Distribution:**
PG’s business is global, with a strong presence in:
   - North America (including the United States)
   - Asia Pacific (including China, India, and Japan)
   - Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, and other LATAM nations)
   - Europe
   - Middle East and Africa (EMEA)

Each of these geographical areas constitutes a key market and presents distinct consumer preferences and opportunities.

### Competitive Landscape

PG's industries are highly competitive.
   - **Consumer Goods Sector:** The consumer goods sector is extremely competitive. Big brands like Unilever and Henkel are direct rivals. They also have to compete with many smaller, local brands.
   - **Shifting Consumer Preferences:** Consumer tastes are constantly evolving. As a result, retailers and manufacturers must constantly adapt, innovate, and create new products and brands.
    - **Digital Marketing and eCommerce:** Digital marketing and eCommerce have changed the way products are bought and sold, particularly for consumer-oriented firms.
     -   **Local Competition:** For products like food, cleaning supplies, and other household basics, local players are usually a force to be reckoned with.

### Financials in Detail

Let’s now analyze the financial results as mentioned in the latest quarterly report.

{: .note }
}
   **Disclaimer:** These financials reflect the most recent quarterly results (ended September 30, 2023) and the last 10K from June 30, 2022.

*   **Revenues**: For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the company generated revenues of $21.811 billion which is an increase of 0.3% YOY. Their sales across operating segments vary due to volume, pricing, and product mix.

*  **Operating Income**: P&G generated operating income of $4.469 billion, an increase of 7%.  The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume which offset increased input costs.

*  **Net Earnings**: The net earnings attributable to P&G has decreased by -3.6% YOY to $3.954 billion which was mainly due to higher income tax expenses. P&G is focused on driving both growth and profitability.

*  **Cash Flow**: P&G’s cash flow is quite strong. P&G has strong working capital, is able to generate lots of free cash flow and has significant cash holdings.

*  **Profit Margins**: P&G’s operating margins are quite healthy at 21%.

*  **Capital Structure**: P&G has a high percentage of equity than debt. It has a good investment grade rating.

*  **Shareholder Returns**: P&G has been consistent in paying dividends to its shareholders. The share price appreciation has been decent but not spectacular.

###  Moat Analysis

After a thorough analysis, PG receives a **3 out of 5** rating for its economic moat. Here’s why:

   *   **Brand Strength (Intangible Assets):** PG owns some of the most recognizable brands globally. This brand equity allows them to command a price premium over competitors and inspires consumer loyalty. The power of brands like Gillette in the shaving market, Tide in laundry, and Pampers in baby care gives P&G a significant edge against competitors.
   *   **Distribution and Economies of Scale:** P&G’s size and distribution network provides a massive advantage over newcomers. They can efficiently transport products in very large quantities, which leads to better pricing and higher margins.
   *   **Switching Costs:** While not as pronounced as in sectors like software, some of P&G's products create a form of switching costs due to habit and preference. Once a consumer settles on a specific brand, inertia kicks in making them less likely to switch (especially in the case of baby products).
  *   **R&D Prowess:** The company spends a large amount on research and development in order to continuously improve their existing products and create new ones. They spent over $1.7 billion for the last quarter and 7.3 Billion YTD in Research and development to constantly innovate and improve their products and gain market share. However, most of that spend is to maintain the same market share by constantly producing new versions of their products, as their competitors are also competing in this sphere. This puts a barrier for new companies but does not really give a very big advantage to P&G over its direct competitors.
   
   **Why Not a 4 or 5?**

   *   **Competition:** While the company has a strong moat, it still has to compete in a saturated market with many big competitors. The consumer goods sector is prone to new competitors or substitute products. As an example, brands like Dollar Shave Club have managed to take market share from Gillette, even if it eventually ended up being bought by Unilever. And for a brief period, some e-commerce companies had put a significant pressure on traditional giants.
   *   **Changing Consumer Preferences:** Consumers become loyal to a particular brand of a certain product, and a small change in preference or tastes can cause them to switch to other brands. This is especially prevalent in non-commodity products like beauty items and clothing.
   *  **Commoditization:** Some of the products, especially home care products, are being commoditized. Hence, the lowest price always wins. This erodes the power of the brand advantage.
   *  **Weakness in pricing power**: Due to strong competition, they might not be able to pass on the increased prices to their end users which results in diminishing margins.

   **Overall, the moat is respectable, but is not as wide or durable as companies like Apple or Google.**

   **"Moat" is one of the most important concepts in investing. A company with a wide and durable moat is far more likely to produce great returns over a long period of time.**

### Legitimate Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience

Even with a considerable moat, PG faces several risks:
   *   **Changing Tastes and Trends**: Trends are constantly changing in the consumer goods market, and what was in fashion yesterday might be out of style today. PG needs to be able to adapt to these trends quickly to prevent loss of sales and market share.
   *   **Supply Chain Disruptions**: As a company that operates globally, there is a risk of geopolitical risk and instability which could cause severe supply chain disruptions.
     *  **Currency Risk:** Since P&G operates in a large number of countries, their revenues and earnings may be hit by negative foreign exchange volatility.
   *   **Competition from Smaller/Local Brands**: Smaller brands that can connect well with specific customer tastes pose a constant threat. These brands can carve into profit pools of bigger corporations and eat into market share.
  *   **Private Label Competition:** Grocery stores producing private labeled products have a long history of stealing market share from big players such as P&G. These private labels are much cheaper and give consumers a feeling that they are getting a much better deal, putting pressure on the margins.
    *  **Eroding Brands:** P&G also faces the risk of losing its brand value. For example, in the past, Kraft cheese was very popular but they lost their luster when private labels started offering the same product for a much lower price.
   *   **Impact from Advertising Effectiveness:** Changes in advertising technology (like increasing spending for short-form video ads and social media ads) can impact how effectively their marketing campaigns are.
      *   **Changing Regulations**: Regulatory changes pertaining to the ingredients, chemicals used in their products or import/export regulations, can affect P&G negatively.
   *  **Overinvestment and Disastrous Acquisitions:** Acquisitions can lead to huge losses if synergies cannot be realized and the expected performance does not come up. Over-diversification into new unproven areas can also be harmful to a company’s existing performance. The company must always choose what's more important to focus on.

Despite these risks, P&G has shown resilience in weathering previous storms. Their diversified portfolio, global reach, and brand strength offer a level of robustness.

      **"Resilience" in an organization means that it has a well-defined competitive advantage so that even if it faces a tough time, it can weather that storm and come out of it stronger.**

### Understandability Rating: 2 / 5

Despite being a consumer goods behemoth, P&G is not that easy to understand. A lot of their operations, financials, and business segments are complicated. There are also certain accounting principles that one must know in order to interpret their numbers, which can make it difficult to understand.

### Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5

P&G’s balance sheet health is solid overall. They have huge cash reserves, high retained earnings, and a relatively low debt-to-equity ratio. However, the market has started penalizing companies with lots of debt, and if P&G overleverages its assets to create value, it may start looking less attractive to investors. However, the company is fiscally stable and has enough flexibility. As such, I believe that their current balance sheet is quite healthy, but they can definitely take steps to improve it.

**Conclusion**

P&G is a business with strong brands and considerable global reach. It has the benefit of economies of scale and switching costs, but also faces high levels of competition in every market they are active in. As an investor, a good strategy will be to wait for dips in the stock prices before investing because as long as the business is sound and the company has a high degree of profitability and a great management, a strong moat provides the framework for it to produce excellent returns over time.
