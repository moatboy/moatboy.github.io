Pessimistic value: $380 B

Procter & Gamble, a consumer goods behemoth, boasts a portfolio of ubiquitous brands deeply ingrained in households worldwide. From Tide to Pampers, Crest to Gillette, these products have become synonymous with their respective categories, affording the company significant pricing power and resilient demand. This translates into a wide moat, though not without its challenges in the evolving consumer landscape.

>The moat rating, management rating, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat: 4/5 - Wide**

PG's moat stems primarily from the **intangible assets** of its powerful brands. As Pat Dorsey emphasizes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, "If a company can charge more for the same product than its peers just by selling it under a brand, that brand very likely constitutes a formidable economic moat."  This is precisely the case with PG. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for Tide over generic detergent, Pampers over store-brand diapers, and Gillette over lesser-known razors. This pricing power, a direct result of brand loyalty and the perceived quality and consistency these brands offer, creates a durable competitive advantage.  

Beyond intangible assets, PG benefits from **economies of scale**, particularly in manufacturing and distribution.  The company's vast global reach allows it to spread fixed costs across a larger sales base, creating a cost advantage over smaller competitors. This advantage is highlighted in *Valuation* by McKinsey, which notes that scale economies "can create durable competitive advantages" by enabling the more efficient delivery of goods and services.  PG's extensive distribution network further strengthens its competitive position, as smaller players often struggle to match its reach and logistical efficiency.  This is especially true in developing markets where the potential consumer base is very substantial.

However, it's crucial to approach moat assessment with skepticism, as Dorsey advises. While PG's brand strength and scale are undeniable, the consumer goods sector is inherently subject to changing consumer preferences and the relentless pressure of competition.  The rise of private label brands, which offer similar products at lower prices, presents a challenge to PG's pricing power. The continued expansion of major retailers with tremendous purchasing power, like Walmart and Costco, also poses a risk, as outlined in Dorsey's work and the Morgan Stanley paper on moats.

While PG's moat is wide, it is not impervious to erosion. Vigilance is key to ensuring its long-term sustainability.

**Management: 3/5**

PG's management, while experienced, warrants a more cautious assessment.  While recent shareholder returns have been decent, they haven't been spectacular, leading to a lukewarm assessment.

* **Positives:** PG's management has successfully navigated numerous challenges over the years, including recessions, changing consumer preferences, and the rise of e-commerce. As discussed in the earnings calls over the last few years, they have focused on strengthening their core brands, cutting costs, and improving efficiency.  These are sound principles, echoing Graham's emphasis on efficient operations in *The Intelligent Investor*. The company's recent strategic shift toward focusing on higher-growth, higher-margin categories like beauty and healthcare also holds promise, aligning with Fisher's focus on long-term growth potential in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*.  Jon Moeller, the CEO, seems focused on cost-cutting.  In the Q3 2023 call he stated that they are "on track for more than $1 billion in cost savings across our five cost buckets."
* **Negatives:**  Management's compensation, while not excessively high, does raise concerns. As highlighted in Buffett's writings in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, executive compensation should be tied to long-term value creation. PG's compensation structure, while incorporating performance metrics, still leaves room for shareholder-value-destroying actions like share buybacks at high prices or acquisitions made purely to boost EPS.  Insider ownership, though not negligible, is not at levels that would suggest exceptional alignment with outside shareholders, a factor emphasized by both Graham and Buffett.  Furthermore, PG's management has historically favored larger acquisitions, which carry a higher risk of value destruction, as detailed in *Valuation* by McKinsey.  Their communication has been adequate, but not exceptional.  While they discuss long-term plans and strategies, they also focus on short-term earnings results, which can be misleading for investors, a point made by Fisher.  Furthermore, capital allocation has been a concern. While recent divestitures have streamlined the company, there have been periods where acquisitions have destroyed shareholder value.

While not incompetent, PG's management has not demonstrated the kind of owner-oriented focus and capital allocation savvy that would warrant a higher rating.

**Valuation: $380 Billion**

To estimate a fair value for PG, we use a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** approach, as outlined in *Valuation* by McKinsey. This model explicitly incorporates growth, return on invested capital (ROIC), and the cost of capital, key value drivers highlighted by Dorsey and McKinsey. 

{: .note }

It is crucial to understand that DCF analysis is not perfect and contains substantial subjective components. It is a tool to guide our reasoning.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume a conservative 1 percent annual growth rate in revenues for the next 10 years, tapering down to the risk-free rate thereafter. This reflects the maturity of the consumer staples market and the increasing competition from private label brands.  PG’s global footprint and focus on emerging markets may help bolster growth somewhat, but it's prudent to err on the side of caution. Andre Schultze mentions in his commentary on the introduction of *The Intelligent Investor* that in the "boom years of the late 1990s, the notion that you could lose almost all your money seemed absurd." But it is precisely this possibility which we have to consider.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a 25 percent operating margin.  While PG's brand strength allows for above-average margins, we lower than the historical average to account for the competitive pressure and rising input costs mentioned in recent earnings calls. As Jon Moeller notes in the Q2 2024 call, "Our margins decreased by 40 basis points, primarily due to gross margin contraction. Our focus is squarely on improving operating margin and cash productivity."
* **Reinvestment Rate:** For the first five years, we use a reinvestment rate of 55 percent. For the remaining five years of our explicit forecast, we assume it gradually decreases to 10 percent, as it reaches maturity. As previously shown in recent earnings calls, P&G is generating more cash than it needs for reinvestment.
* **Cost of Capital:** We compute the cost of capital using the following estimates and assumptions:
    * **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.1 percent (10-Year U.S. Treasury Bond rate as of July 2024)
    * **Equity Risk Premium:** 5 percent (Historical average)
    * **Beta:** 0.70 (Unlevered Beta, using historical data and a 30 percent long term target debt ratio)
    * **Marginal Tax Rate:** 25% (Effective tax rate in recent years)
    * **Cost of Debt:**  4.5% (Adjusted for default spread)
    * **Capital Structure:**  30 percent debt and 70 percent equity (Long-term target)

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is approximately 7.5 percent.

* **Terminal Value:** We estimate the terminal value using the perpetual growth approach.  We assume a perpetuity growth rate of 3.0%.  This results in a terminal value of $493 billion in today's dollars.

**Calculations:**

* **Explicit forecast period:** We compute the annual free cash flow (FCF) for the next 10 years by multiplying after-tax operating income by (1 - Reinvestment rate).
* **Present value of explicit forecast period:** We discount the FCFs back to today at the WACC.
* **Present value of terminal value:** We discount the terminal value back to today at the WACC.
* **Enterprise value:** We sum the present values of the explicit forecast period and the terminal value.
* **Equity value:** We subtract the value of debt and add the value of excess cash. PG’s excess cash, as reported on the balance sheet, is approximately $14 billion.
* **Value per share:**  We divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. PG has approximately 13.5 billion shares outstanding (adjusted for share buybacks).

{: .highlight }

The resulting DCF valuation is about **$380 billion**, a downward adjustment from the current market capitalization of PG in late July 2024, reflecting our more pessimistic assumptions about long-term growth and competitive pressures.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Successful execution of the company's strategic focus on higher-growth, higher-margin categories:** If management can deliver on its promise to revitalize growth in these categories, it could lead to upward revisions in earnings estimates and potentially boost the company's valuation multiple.
* **Emerging markets growth:** As noted in numerous earnings calls, PG is banking heavily on growth in emerging markets.  If these markets grow faster than expected, it could provide a significant upside catalyst. As Jon Moeller said in the Q1 2024 call, "The strength of developing markets relative to developed has become much more balanced."
* **Cost-cutting and efficiency improvements:** The success of the cost-cutting initiatives outlined in recent earnings calls could lead to margin expansion and higher profitability, potentially enhancing shareholder returns and valuation. As Jon Moeller said in the Q3 2023 earnings call, "Productivity savings, which is really the backbone of the improvement, has exceeded half a billion dollars." 
* **Favorable changes in commodity prices:** Input costs have been a significant headwind for PG.  If commodity prices decline, it could ease margin pressure and improve profitability. The CEO's comments in many of the recent earnings call reflect this focus and the benefit that the company would derive from lower commodity prices.
* **Successful acquisition/divestiture:** While larger acquisitions carry significant risks, a smaller, strategically aligned acquisition or a divestiture of a low-performing business unit could unlock shareholder value. The management has indicated its willingness to actively manage its portfolio of businesses as necessary.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Slowing growth in developed markets:** As discussed in recent earnings calls, PG is facing slowing growth in developed markets, its core markets. Management has announced its plan to mitigate this risk by focusing on emerging markets, which brings its own set of challenges related to economic and political risk. This is reminiscent of Graham’s anecdote in *The Intelligent Investor* of American Can, whose management did not foresee the saturation of the canned goods industry.
* **Intense competition:**  The consumer goods industry is highly competitive, with both large multinational competitors and smaller local players vying for market share. The rise of private label brands further intensifies the competitive landscape.  P&G's management has addressed this challenge in earnings calls by emphasizing the strength of their brands and their focus on innovation.
* **Inflation and supply chain disruptions:** Rising input costs and supply chain challenges have pressured PG's margins.  Management has implemented price increases and cost-cutting measures to mitigate these headwinds, but the long-term impact remains to be seen.  The focus on cost-cutting mentioned by the CEO reflects a strategic shift that is a direct reaction to these risks, especially as inflation and supply chain disruptions were exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.  
* **Changing consumer preferences:** Consumer preferences are constantly evolving, with consumers increasingly focused on health and wellness, sustainability, and personalized products.  P&G's management has acknowledged this trend in earnings calls and has outlined its plan to adapt by focusing on innovation and expanding its presence in these growing categories.

In conclusion, Procter & Gamble enjoys a wide moat derived from its iconic brands and scale advantages. However, it's essential to recognize the inherent risks of the consumer goods sector. Management, while experienced, warrants a more measured assessment given its focus on short-term metrics and a history of large acquisitions.  Based on our DCF valuation and considering the prevailing uncertainties, the stock appears modestly overvalued at its current price.  However, several potential catalysts, including the successful execution of the company's growth strategy and continued emerging market expansion, could drive future returns.  As with any investment, careful monitoring and continuous evaluation are crucial.  After all, as Benjamin Graham reminds us in *The Intelligent Investor*, "Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike."
