**Moat (2/5):**

Hess benefits from some cost advantages stemming from its ownership of low-cost oil fields (Guyana and North Dakota Bakken).  However, these advantages are not as strong as some other integrated oil and gas companies which own unique, world-class assets (e.g., Ultra Petroleum with its Wyoming properties). These cost advantages also do not constitute a wide moat in and of themselves.

> The big kahuna of cost advantages, of course, is scale, and scale advantages can create extremely durable economic moats. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

Hess does not benefit from significant scale advantages in the integrated oil and gas industry at a national level. At a regional level, Hess does benefit from being one of the major players, but competition with other companies could erode these cost advantages over time.

> Cost advantages matter most in industries where price is a big part of the customer's purchase decision. - Valuation

Oil and gas is a commodity, so prices are determined by global supply and demand. Hess's ability to differentiate itself, and therefore its pricing power, is somewhat limited. This weakens the case for a wider moat.

> If a company can charge more for the same product than its peers by selling under a brand, that brand very likely constitutes a formidable economic moat. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

Hess doesn't have a strong brand like Tiffany or Coca-Cola that allows it to charge a premium for its products. Its brand does not constitute much of a moat. Patents are also not part of Hess's story.

> The products or services that a company sells may be hard for customers to give up, which creates customer switching costs that give the firm pricing power. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

Hess does not benefit from significant switching costs. If Hess raises prices, customers can easily switch to its competitors without hassle or cost. 
The company doesn't benefit from network effects either.

**Management (3/5):**

John Hess, CEO of Hess Corporation, has extensive experience in the oil and gas industry, having been with the company for over 30 years.

> Moats are a crucial element in Morningstar's stock ratings. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

While John Hess has a long track record in the industry, there have been concerns about Hess' capital allocation decisions.

> Growth and ROIC drive value. - Valuation

While Hess has made some positive investments such as divesting its retail gas stations and midstream assets, it made large acquisitions (e.g. of Permian and Utica assets) in the early to mid 2010's at near-peak commodity prices which have not added much value over subsequent years.

> A company can fill in its own moat by investing heavily in areas in which it has *no* competitive advantage. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

Additionally, the stock has underperformed the overall market since the company's inception, suggesting that Hess' management hasn't consistently delivered above-average returns to shareholders.

> An often-expressed concern is that company earnings may reflect the management team’s “propaganda” rather than its performance - The Intelligent Investor

Some financial metrics have been volatile over the past five years. For instance, its return on assets spiked as high as 19 percent in 2014 before plummeting to below zero during the oil price collapse of 2015-2016. Its returns have been below the cost of capital for the past 5 years (10 percent or less compared to the estimated cost of capital of around 12 percent). However, its financials have shown some improvement lately, which implies that the management team has made positive adjustments. These inconsistencies in performance raise a flag.

Compensation seems to be appropriate for both John Hess and its CFO, given Hess’ size and financial performance, although John Hess' total compensation is higher relative to its peers, given the company's performance. There has also been a consistent decrease in management's stock ownership in recent years, dropping from nearly 8 percent of shares outstanding several years ago to about 1 percent now, though this could be due to the substantial share count increase following the 2013 sale of its retail and marketing business.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

> If you buy them at a significant discount to fair value, but the best investors do—legends like Warren Buffett, Bill Nygren at Oakmark Funds, and Mason Hawkins at Longleaf Funds. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

Hess has several potential catalysts on the horizon that could lift its share price.

First, Hess's cost advantages in Guyana and North Dakota are now starting to manifest, particularly now that the company is prioritizing shareholder returns and paying down debt following the sale of its retail assets. Given the current environment of higher oil prices, this is quite favorable to Hess's financial performance, which is increasingly in line with its long-term intrinsic value, although commodity prices could always drop. 

Second, Hess has been increasing its presence in a number of high-growth emerging markets, such as Guyana, which has become an increasingly important part of Hess's business in recent years. Its Guyana and Bakken assets constitute over half of its production at current levels and are expected to comprise over 80 percent of production by 2030.

> Perhaps even more important to keep in mind, if you're looking for companies with a competitive advantage, is that it's a lot easier to dig a moat in some industries than in others. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

Guyana benefits from lower royalties and taxes than most countries, so the economics of these oil producing ventures have been enhanced. Furthermore, some of the production contracts in Guyana are structured so that the breakeven price is lower than most other parts of the world. In other words, the oil from Guyana can be profitably sold at a lower price than many other regions.

> Look for cost advantages. - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

Finally, Hess has been aggressively pursuing share repurchases.

> In our experience, many managers like another party to take the blame, and share repurchases are therefore generally limited to companies whose shares are trading below their true economic worth - The Essays of Warren Buffett

This bodes well for its shareholders as share repurchases at a discount are value accretive.

However, the recent sale of Hess Midstream assets could reduce this flexibility, as its free cash flow is now lower.

**Valuation ($37.6 billion):**

I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate Hess' intrinsic value. 

* **Free Cash Flow:** I estimated Hess's free cash flow based on its operating income, capital expenditures, depreciation, and changes in working capital for each of the next 10 years, then discounted them at a 12% WACC. The key here is to use operating expenses at current levels and not add them back into the valuation, because they are true costs and not accounting artifacts. Additionally, the impairment charge in 2020 is not included as an operating expense as it is a reflection of commodity prices.

    Depreciation and Depletion. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of capitalized tangible and intangible exploration and production costs are included in determining free cash flow, on a year-over-year basis, but since they are non-cash expense items, we reduce the cash outflow attributable to investment by subtracting these items. - Hess Corporation, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, December 31, 2021


* **Terminal Value:** I estimated the terminal value by assuming a stable growth rate of 3% and a return on invested capital of 10% beyond year 10.
{: .warning }

I've tried to be somewhat pessimistic with these growth assumptions, given the volatile nature of the oil and gas industry, and the long-term trend of falling oil prices over the past decade, and its dependence on the rate of growth in emerging markets, particularly in Guyana. 
{: .warning }


* **Other Adjustments:** I added back cash, marketable securities, and minority interests and subtracted out debt and other liabilities. Also, I did not model any effects from acquisitions. Nor did I include the cost of share repurchases in my model. 

My DCF model yields an intrinsic value of $37.6 billion as of July 2023.

The actual share price at the time of valuation is around $155 per share. The market capitalization is $45.7 billion.  This value may reflect that Hess's cost advantages in Guyana and North Dakota are starting to manifest, given current oil price levels, as well as the company's focus on shareholder returns and paying down debt, and possibly includes some overvaluation of its Guyana assets relative to competitors. I have been told by analysts at Morningstar that Hess' Guyana assets are currently assigned a discount rate around 250 basis points lower than the industry average for comparable projects. The current spread between the 10-year average and median ROIC of the Oil Exploration and Production Industry is approximately 8 percent (18-10%) at median levels. If these assets are not as low-risk as some have believed, then my valuation would indeed prove itself conservative.

> You will often have only two inputs to work with when valuing a company --  the company's current financial statements and a consensus view about how the company will perform over the next five to ten years. - The Little Book of Valuation

This valuation approach is clearly influenced by my pessimism concerning the future of the oil and gas industry, and the likelihood of management making good decisions going forward.
