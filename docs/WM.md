Waste Management operates in a business with inherent advantages that create a durable competitive advantage—an economic moat.  It is the leading player in the waste management industry in North America. The industry benefits from economies of scale and regional density, and collecting, transporting, and processing waste is inherently a local business. Therefore, WM and other large waste management firms benefit from these dynamics. The industry is also one that requires a lot of capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment, and a large fleet of trucks to transport the waste, which acts as another barrier to entry.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


However, the waste management industry also has a number of characteristics that reduce its attractiveness. The core business—collecting, transporting, and disposing of waste—is essentially a commodity business, and customers are primarily focused on price. Differentiation is minimal and customers have little loyalty. There are many local and national competitors in the industry, such as Republic Services, Waste Connections, and GFL Environmental. 

**Moat Rating Justification:** WM's moat derives from its position as the industry leader (scale) as well as regulatory approvals. It is not necessarily easy to get new permits and build new recycling facilities, even in the United States, particularly as local governments generally have a NIMBY attitude about such projects. However, given intense competition in the industry and increasing industry maturity, combined with WM's relatively low revenue growth rate, I am only giving its moat a rating of 3 out of 5.  As Pat Dorsey writes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, while the company’s brand certainly helps, it has more to do with the size of its distribution network, which is much more extensive than those of its competitors.  As Morningstar notes (as highlighted in the book), the firm generates high returns on invested capital due to an economic moat that can lock out competitors for a long time. However, as also highlighted in Dorsey's book, the presence of many local and national competitors means that any competitive advantage stemming from scale will be constrained in its geographic reach.

**Management Rating Justification:**  WM's management team is rated 3 out of 5.  While the company has delivered strong and steady earnings and returns on invested capital, its revenue growth rate is modest and there are concerns about management's capital allocation decisions.  Like many large companies with strong cash flow and limited reinvestment opportunities, WM has returned cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. However, WM also has periodically made acquisitions for diversification and growth, with mixed success. As recounted in *Valuation*, many acquisitions destroy value. The management team also appears to be focused on short-term performance metrics such as earnings, which can be detrimental to long-term value creation, as Aswath Damodaran highlights. The company does not overly use stock options as a form of compensation, which is a positive, as Warren Buffett discusses in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.  Overall, WM’s management seems fairly standard for a mature company in a mature industry. They appear to be neither particularly exceptional nor particularly bad, thus warranting a middling score.

**Business Overview:**

WM operates through two main segments: Collection and Disposal, and Recycling and Renewable Energy. The Collection and Disposal segment is the largest, accounting for around 80 percent of revenues.  This segment provides traditional waste collection and disposal services, which are essential services with low switching costs.  The Recycling and Renewable Energy segment is smaller but growing. This segment processes and sells recyclables, and also develops and operates renewable energy projects, such as landfill gas-to-energy facilities.  Management anticipates increasing revenue contributions from the renewable energy segment, as highlighted in their Third Quarter 2023 earnings call.

**Financial Analysis:**

WM has historically generated consistent revenues and solid profits.  Between 2019 and 2022, revenues grew at a compounded rate of 7.2% annually. However, its revenues dropped slightly in 2023, largely as a result of the cyclical nature of some of its revenue streams, in particular recycling. As discussed on WM's Q3 2023 Earnings Call, overall economic conditions were affecting recycling volumes, which were down, on a year-over-year basis, by 7 percent.

Profit margins have been stable or declining, largely as a result of pressure on pricing, especially during economic downturns, as highlighted by the firm's CFO during the Q2 2022 Earnings Call.  For the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, WM's EBITDA margin was approximately 27 percent. WM's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is generally in the 10–12 percent range. Despite the volatility in commodity prices and economic activity, ROIC remains healthy, as shown in the exhibits provided in Morgan Stanley's *Measuring Global Insights* Report.

**Valuation and Calculation:**

{: .important }

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate WM's intrinsic value.  We will begin by forecasting the company’s financial performance for the next five years, based on recent earnings calls and SEC filings.

**Key Assumptions:**

{: .note }
*   **Revenue growth:** We assume revenue growth of 2% annually over the next five years, given its mature industry and competitive environment. This is slightly higher than our pessimistic assessment of the firm’s long-term prospects, which is in line with real GDP growth in the long run, as explained in *Valuation*.
{: .note }
*It's important to keep valuations firmly anchored in what is most likely to happen, especially in tough-to-value businesses, as Aswath Damodaran discusses in *The Dark Side of Valuation*.  Remember, too, that a high growth rate over an extended period requires a tremendous amount of luck.*
*   **Operating margin:** We assume stable operating margins of 27% over the next five years, given that the company operates in an industry with limited differentiation. This is based on the company's current margins. However, in a challenging macroeconomic environment, this may be too optimistic, and prices for recycled commodities may be challenging.
*   **Reinvestment rate:**  We assume a reinvestment rate of 10% of after-tax operating income.  This means that WM is plowing only 10% of its after-tax income back into the business, in line with the average of mature firms, as mentioned in *Valuation*.
*   **Cost of capital:**  We estimate WM's cost of capital to be 7.5%, based on a risk-free rate of 4.5%, an equity risk premium of 4%, a beta of 0.8, and a marginal tax rate of 25%.
*   **Terminal value:**  We assume a terminal growth rate of 2% and a terminal ROIC of 10%, which is a conservative assessment, in line with the more pessimistic set of assumptions for many comparable firms.

**Calculations:**

Based on these assumptions, our DCF model projects a free cash flow (FCF) to the firm of $8.8 billion in the terminal year.  Discounting the terminal value and the free cash flows over the next five years back to the present, we arrive at an enterprise value of $78 billion.  Subtracting WM's net debt of $14.3 billion and dividing by the number of shares outstanding, we arrive at a fair value of $65 per share.  WM's current price (as of October 27, 2024) is $52.3.  Our DCF valuation therefore suggests that the stock is trading at a small premium, in relative terms, to our more pessimistic estimate of intrinsic value.  Given WM's steady-state attributes, I am rounding the valuation down slightly. Thus, it gives a valuation of $63.7 Billion, based on 1 billion shares outstanding.  

**Catalyst:**

WM's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.  The company is a mature business in a mature industry, and significant share-price appreciation is unlikely.  However, there are a few potential catalysts that could drive the stock higher:

*   **Continued growth in the recycling and renewable energy segment:** WM is investing heavily in this segment, and it could become a more significant contributor to the company's overall results.
*   **Improvement in margins:**  Management's cost-cutting efforts could lead to higher margins, which would increase the company's profitability and value.
*   **Increased acquisitions:** In a fragmented market, further acquisitions could generate substantial synergies in sales, administrative staff, and equipment, although the potential for value destruction, through overpaying for acquisitions, always exists.
*   **A more substantial commitment to share repurchases:** Given its modest growth rate and substantial free cash flow, WM could increase the value of its existing shares by repurchasing a greater amount of the firm’s shares.


**Concerns and Controversies:**

One recent concern is the cyclical downturn in the recycling business, causing downward pressure on earnings. Management acknowledges this challenge but emphasizes the company's ability to navigate industry cycles, as highlighted in the Q3 2023 Earnings Call. The company's long-term contracts with municipalities, as noted by the CFO on the Q4 2022 Earnings Call,  and a geographically diverse customer base should provide some stability to revenues, even though prices for certain services are cyclical. Another potential headwind for the firm is higher interest rates, which increase the company’s borrowing costs and may reduce its financial flexibility, though the CFO, during the Q2 2023 Earnings Call, downplayed the impact of debt on the firm's financial situation. This suggests that the impact is not negligible but also probably not catastrophic.
