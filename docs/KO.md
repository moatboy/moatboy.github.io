Moat: 4/5

Pessimistic value: $217 B

Coca-Cola is a global beverage giant, best known for its namesake soft drink. The company operates a franchise model, manufacturing concentrates and syrups that are then sold to independent bottlers who handle the production and distribution of the finished products. While this business model is simple, its competitive advantages are formidable.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.
**Moat Analysis**

Coca-Cola's wide moat stems from several sources, justifying a 4/5 rating:

1. **Brand:**  Coca-Cola possesses arguably the world’s strongest brand in nonalcoholic beverages. This brand recognition translates into pricing power and enduring customer loyalty,  allowing the company to charge a premium for its products. As Dorsey highlights in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, a brand constitutes a moat only if it increases the consumer's willingness to pay. This clearly holds true for Coca-Cola.

2. **Switching Costs (Bottlers):**  Although the end consumer faces minimal switching costs between Coke and Pepsi, bottlers face significant financial and logistical obstacles in switching suppliers. This dynamic, mentioned by Dorsey, creates substantial stickiness for Coca-Cola and ensures predictable revenue streams. Bottlers have invested heavily in Coca-Cola-specific equipment and processes, making a shift incredibly disruptive.

3. **Network Effect (Bottling Network):**  Coca-Cola's extensive bottling network, spanning over 200 countries and territories, creates another formidable barrier to entry.  As highlighted in *Valuation*, the interconnected nature of this distribution network generates efficiencies and value that would be exceptionally difficult and costly for a new entrant to replicate.  Each new bottler added to the system benefits from the larger network, and vice versa.

4. **Scale Advantages:** Coca-Cola benefits from economies of scale in the production of concentrates and syrups.  Its massive production volume enables it to spread fixed costs across a larger revenue base, as detailed in *Valuation*, providing a cost advantage over smaller competitors. Moreover, as mentioned by Michael Mauboussin, cost efficiencies stemming from large distribution networks are a powerful source of competitive advantage.

**Moat Risks**

While substantial, Coca-Cola’s moat faces some risks:

* **Changing Consumer Preferences:** Continued shift towards healthier beverage options.
* **Competition:**  PepsiCo remains a potent rival.
* **Commodity Price Volatility:** Sugar and other raw materials.
* **Geopolitical Risks:**  Operating in various countries and regions worldwide.

**Valuation**

Applying a pessimistic and conservative approach, valuing Coca-Cola is complex because of its franchise model and global reach. A rigorous analysis requires examining the profitability and cash flows from both its concentrate business and bottling investments. However, the bottling investments are not broken down in the company's reports and therefore require making estimates.

For this valuation, I will focus on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), which is a solid measure of profitability before any effects from financial leverage. This will then be used with the key value driver formula to calculate the value of operations.

**Assumptions and Calculations**

1. **Revenues:**
    * Conservative average annual revenue growth of 2% for the next 10 years, reflecting market maturity and competition.
    * Terminal growth rate of 1%, reflecting long-run nominal growth in the global economy.

2. **Profitability and Reinvestment Rate:**
    * Operating margin of 25% of revenues, reflecting current levels and competitive pressures.
    * Reinvestment rate of 10% in stable growth period (beginning in year 11), in line with sustainable growth.

3. **Cost of Capital:**
    * Risk-free rate: 4% (10-year US Treasury bond rate as of November 2023).
    * Equity risk premium: 5% (Historical average).
    * Beta: 0.6 (Reflecting the relatively low volatility of Coca-Cola's stock price)
    * Cost of equity = 4% + 0.6 * 5% = 7%
    * After-tax cost of debt:  4% (Estimated from corporate bond yields).
    * Target capital structure: 15% debt, 85% equity. (Long-term, relatively conservative).
    * WACC = (0.15 * 4%) + (0.85 * 7%) = 6.55%

4. **Valuation using the key value driver formula (adjusted for a terminal value):**
    * NOPLAT<sub>2024</sub> = $14 billion (Estimated from Coca-Cola’s recent financials and assumptions)
    * RONIC = 12% (Return on new investments, a conservative estimate given expected competition).
    * Terminal Value = (14 * 1.01)/(0.0655 - 0.01) = $247.8 billion
    * PV of FCF for the next 10 years: $81.52 billion
    * Total value of operating assets: $81.52 billion + (247.8 billion/1.0655<sup>10</sup>)  = $217 billion

**Additional Considerations:**

* No adjustments for cash, other holdings, or debt. Given the lack of clear visibility into many of the bottling investments, I use a conservative estimate that the net value of cash, minority interests in publicly traded companies, equity investments, and excess real estate is offset by long-term debt and deferred taxes.

**Valuation Conclusion:**

Based on these pessimistic and conservative assumptions,  a fair value for Coca-Cola is approximately **$217 billion**. This represents a 10-year average annual return of 4.55% in intrinsic value, slightly lower than what you can expect to earn by simply buying 10-Year Treasury bonds. This is a bargain purchase in a relatively pricey market. Given the strength of Coca-Cola's moat, this lower valuation offers a margin of safety, as emphasized by Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*.
