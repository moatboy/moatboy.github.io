Kering is a global Luxury group that manages a portfolio of renowned Houses in Fashion, Leather Goods, Jewelry, and Watches.  The rationale for the relatively low moat and management ratings, along with a moderate catalyst rating, arises from a pessimistic and skeptical evaluation of the company's competitive landscape, financials, and management actions, drawing heavily upon principles from the provided resources, especially "The Intelligent Investor" and "Valuation".

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

While Kering possesses some brand power, particularly with its flagship brands like Gucci and Saint Laurent, the luxury sector is characterized by fickle consumer preferences and intense competition.  "The Little Book That Builds Wealth" emphasizes that brand popularity must translate into pricing power and sustained excess returns to constitute a moat. Kering's margins, while healthy, are not as outsized as some other luxury companies, and its reliance on a limited number of key brands creates vulnerability. The moat is not deemed wide enough to warrant a higher rating given the potential for brand erosion and competitive pressures.  As highlighted in "Valuation", brands can lose their luster, and past performance is not a guarantee of future success.

**Management (3/5):**

Kering's management has a mixed track record. While they have overseen periods of robust growth, particularly with Gucci, there have also been missteps and inconsistencies. The company's capital allocation decisions, including acquisitions and divestitures, have not always created value, echoing Michael Burry's skeptical approach to acquisitions in the provided articles. Furthermore, recent management changes and succession planning raise questions about long-term stability, a key concern highlighted in "The Essays of Warren Buffett". The company's communication, while improving, could be more transparent regarding the performance of individual brands and their strategic priorities. While insider ownership exists, it is not at a level to fully align management and shareholder interests, raising potential agency problems, as discussed in "The Intelligent Investor". While executive compensation has not raised red flags, it is within industry norms and doesn't offer unique incentives for long term value creation.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for Kering include further expansion in emerging markets, growth in online sales, and successful integration of recent acquisitions. However, as emphasized in "Valuation," success in these areas is not guaranteed, particularly given the economic slowdown and intensifying competition in the luxury sector.  The potential for management to improve operational efficiency and capitalize on these catalysts exists, but a pessimistic outlook dictates a moderate rating.

**Valuation (€55 billion):**

{: .note }

Valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow (DCF) model using the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) approach and an equity risk premium-based cost of equity estimation. A pessimistic outlook is applied to growth and margin assumptions.  Financial data for the years 2018-2022 was taken from Kering's annual reports.


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Based on historical data and a pessimistic view of the luxury market, revenue growth is projected at 3% annually for the next 5 years and 1% thereafter (terminal growth). This is justified by the mature market for luxury goods and expected economic downturn, echoing the cyclicality discussed in "Valuation".
* **Operating Margin:**  A conservative operating margin of 28% is assumed, slightly below the company’s recent historical average. This reflects the pressure on margins from intensifying competition and rising input costs.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  A reinvestment rate of 40% is assumed, in line with historical levels.
* **Cost of Equity:**  Using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), with a risk-free rate of 4.0%, a market risk premium of 4.5%, and a beta of 1.10, the cost of equity is estimated at 8.95%. This relatively low beta, drawn from historical analysis, reflects the business model and relative lower risk compared to other luxury goods companies.
* **Cost of Debt:**  The after-tax cost of debt is estimated at 2.5%, reflecting current interest rates.
* **Target Capital Structure:** A target capital structure of 45% debt and 55% equity is assumed, based on historical levels.
* **Tax Rate:**  A 25% tax rate is assumed.

**Calculations:**

1. **FCFF:** Projected free cash flows are calculated for each of the next 10 years using the projected revenues, margins, and reinvestment rate.
2. **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity growth model: Terminal Value = FCFF<sub>10</sub> * (1+g) / (WACC – g), where g is the terminal growth rate and WACC is the weighted average cost of capital.
3. **Present Value:**  The present value of the free cash flows and the terminal value are calculated using the WACC as the discount rate.
4. **Enterprise Value:** The present values are summed to arrive at the enterprise value.
5. **Equity Value:**  The value of debt and other non-equity claims (including minority interests, deferred taxes, and pension liabilities) are subtracted from the enterprise value to arrive at the equity value.
6. **Value per Share:**  The equity value is divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the value per share.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Kering has faced concerns over its reliance on Gucci, slowdown in the Chinese market and recent management change. The company’s performance during the post COVID-19 period indicates its potential for recovery.

**Conclusion:**

Kering's luxury portfolio offers some resilience, though it does not command a wide economic moat. The management, while experienced, has a mixed record and faces challenges in maintaining past growth and navigating the competitive landscape.  A cautious approach and a margin of safety, as emphasized by Graham, are warranted when evaluating an investment in Kering.  The discounted cash flow valuation suggests a fair value of €55 billion, but as Damodaran highlights, all valuations are biased, and it is crucial to recognize and understand those biases.
