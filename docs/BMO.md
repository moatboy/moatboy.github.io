BMO, a Canadian multinational investment bank and financial services company, holds a narrow moat primarily derived from cost advantages stemming from its large size and established distribution network within Canada. While it enjoys a strong presence in its home market, BMO's moat is limited by intensifying competition, particularly from other large Canadian banks and increasingly from U.S. players. Its U.S. operations, while growing, lack the same scale and brand recognition as its Canadian operations, rendering its competitive advantages weaker south of the border.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

BMO's moat is based on cost advantages (scale) and switching costs.

* **Cost Advantages:**  As one of Canada's "Big Five" banks, BMO benefits from economies of scale, particularly in areas like technology infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and back-office operations. Its large distribution network across Canada also provides a cost advantage over smaller competitors. However, these cost advantages are not insurmountable, as evidenced by the competitive pressures from other large banks who enjoy similar scale benefits.  Furthermore, the rise of fintech and online banking could potentially compress margins and erode these advantages over time.
* **Switching Costs:** While switching costs exist for retail banking customers (e.g., the hassle of changing accounts, direct deposits, and bill payments), they are not exceptionally high. Consumers are generally price-sensitive and willing to switch banks for better rates or services, as noted by Pat Dorsey in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," particularly when switching is becoming easier due to technology. 

>  "Switching costs can be tough to identify… often need a thorough understanding of a customer's experience."


These characteristics warrant a narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5.  A strict assessment recognizes the potential for erosion of these advantages over time.

**Management (3/5):**

BMO's management earns a moderate rating of 3 out of 5. While exhibiting some positive qualities, certain concerns warrant a more pessimistic view.

* **Positives:**  BMO has delivered consistent, if unspectacular, financial performance, including maintaining relatively stable returns on equity.  Recent acquisitions, such as Bank of the West, demonstrate a willingness to expand and grow, albeit not always successfully as highlighted in the Q2 2023 earnings call where the CEO discussed integration issues and expected cost savings to be fully realized in 2024 (a year after the acquisition). The bank also seems to be focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a practice favored by long-term investors like Warren Buffett as discussed in "The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America".
* **Concerns:** The Bank of the West acquisition was costly, potentially overvalued, and has yet to demonstrate synergistic benefits, as evidenced by integration challenges and delayed realization of cost savings mentioned in the Q3 2023 earnings call.  This raises questions about capital allocation discipline and acquisition integration skills. Executive compensation, while not outrageously excessive, seems aligned with short-term metrics like revenue growth, which is not always indicative of long-term value creation, reflecting a potential managerial short-termism (as discussed in McKinsey's "Valuation"). Insider ownership, while present, is not high enough to fully align management's interests with those of outside shareholders. Communication from management often lacks the level of transparency and candid discussion of long-term value drivers advocated by Dorsey.  The strategic focus on U.S. expansion also carries risks, given the greater competition and BMO's relative lack of scale in that market.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

BMO's catalyst rating is a moderate 2 out of 5.

* **Potential Positives:** Successful integration of Bank of the West could lead to cost savings and enhanced earnings growth.  Growth in the U.S. market, although competitive, could provide a longer-term avenue for expansion,  A strategic focus on digital banking and fintech could improve efficiency and attract new customers. An improving macroeconomic environment in North America could also benefit BMO's loan growth and profitability.
* **Concerns:** A slowing global economy or a recession could negatively impact BMO's financial performance. Intensifying competition and margin pressure in both Canada and the U.S. could limit profitability. Further acquisitions, if not carefully evaluated and integrated, could destroy shareholder value.

**Valuation ($68.5B):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, employing the key value driver formula presented in McKinsey's *Valuation*, was used to estimate BMO's intrinsic value. A conservative and pessimistic outlook was adopted to reflect the current economic and competitive landscape.

> "The simple exercise of estimating the value of a share of a company is the key to buying stocks for less than their potential value.”


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% annually for the next five years (modest growth given economic outlook and competitive intensity). After incorporating information from the bank's Q2 2023 earnings call about the Canadian P&C (Property & Casualty) business revenue growth, I expect only a 2% growth.
* **Operating Margin:** 13% (reflecting margin pressure due to competition and higher interest rates). For 2024, I see a margin compression to 13% as mentioned by the bank's CFO in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** 10%  (moderately declining ROIC over the next 10 years, converging towards the cost of capital as competitive intensity rises).
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 8.5% (based on a long-term risk-free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 5%, and beta of 0.8, and taking into account comments made by CFO in Q2 2023 earnings call).
* **Terminal Growth:** 2% (long-term sustainable growth).

**Calculations:**

{: .important }

1. **NOPLAT (Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes):** $8.3B (based on current operating income and effective tax rate).
2. **Invested Capital:** $110B.
3. **FCFF (Free Cash Flow to Firm):** $6.9B (FCFF = NOPLAT * (1-Reinvested Capital).


| Year | NOPLAT ($B) | Growth | Reinvestment Rate | FCFF ($B) | PV of FCFF ($B)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 8.3 | 2.00% | 10.0% | 6.9 | 6.3 |
| 2 | 8.5 | 2.00% | 10.0% | 7.0 | 5.8|
| 3 | 8.7 | 2.00% | 10.0% | 7.1| 5.3|
| 4 | 8.9 | 2.00% | 10.0% | 7.2| 4.9 |
| 5 | 9.1 | 2.00% | 10.0% | 7.3| 4.6 |
| Terminal Value| 194.4 | | | 

4. **Terminal Value:** $194.4B (using the perpetuity growth model: Terminal Value = FCFF * (1+g) / (WACC-g)). As mentioned by Joe Mansueto in the foreword of "The Little Book that Builds Wealth," using this terminal value approach assumes that the growth and ROIC remain constant beyond the explicit forecast period.
5. **Present Value of Operating Assets:** $261.2B (sum of PV of FCFFs and PV of Terminal Value).
6. **Value of Non-operating Assets:**  $10.7B (estimated from financial statements). This includes excess cash and cash equivalents as mentioned by Aswath Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*.
7. **Value of Debt:** $21.5B (estimated from financial statements).
8. **Value of Equity:** $250.4B (Value of Operating Assets + Value of Non-operating Assets - Value of Debt).
9. **Number of Shares Outstanding:** 1.25B
10. **Value per Share:**  $200.32 (Value of Equity / Number of Shares Outstanding).

{: .highlight }

Based on this DCF model, with a 25% margin of safety (as prescribed by Benjamin Graham and discussed in his book *The Intelligent Investor*),  BMO's fair value is approximately **$150 per share**, or approximately $68.5 Billion. This valuation is significantly lower than the current market price.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

BMO has faced criticism for its handling of certain customer accounts and its role in financing fossil fuel projects. Management has addressed these issues in earnings calls and public statements, emphasizing its commitment to customer service and responsible banking practices. However, the bank's reputation has suffered somewhat, and these issues could continue to pose a challenge going forward. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, management briefly talked about the bank's ongoing effort to improve processes and customer experience, specifically in its commercial banking and capital markets businesses. This is a positive sign given recent criticism.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

> "If you have found something interesting, don't be afraid to do a little digging on your own.”



Several factors could potentially boost BMO's share price, including improved integration of Bank of the West, successful expansion in the U.S. market, higher interest rates and margins, and a stronger performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies.

**Overall:**

BMO is a large, well-established bank with a narrow moat and moderately competent management. However, its current valuation appears rich relative to our DCF model.  A conservative and pessimistic investor might consider waiting for a lower entry point before investing in BMO.
