{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Keysight operates in the electronic measurement industry, facing competition from companies like Fortive, Rohde & Schwarz, and Anritsu. While they are a market leader in some segments, competition is present. Switching costs for many products are low, with the notable exception of software offerings where integration can create some stickiness.  However, this is not enough to warrant a higher moat rating, as competitors can and do develop competing software, and customers may shift preferences over time.

**Management (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:** Keysight's management team has a mixed record. They successfully navigated the spin-off from Agilent and have delivered solid financial performance in recent years. However, like many companies, they overestimated growth during the dot-com bubble and in more recent years. The management has expressed its commitment to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, rather than unproductive M&A. (Q2 2021 earnings call)  This is consistent with value-creating principles.
* **Communication:** Management communicates openly with investors about results and challenges. They provide segment-level details, facilitating a deeper understanding of the business drivers.  Their engagement with long-term investors is commendable, reflecting an ownership mindset, as advocated by Warren Buffet in “The Essays of Warren Buffet.” However, like many management teams, they may sometimes overemphasize short-term earnings and guidance at the expense of a longer-term vision, which warrants some skepticism.
* **Capital Allocation:** Keysight is committed to returning 70% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases (Q2 2023 Earnings Call).  The company has also been prudent in its M&A activity, focusing on strategic acquisitions rather than empire-building (Q2 2021 earnings call).  This suggests a reasonable approach to capital allocation, though the long-term impact of their acquisitions remains to be fully assessed.  Their debt policy is conservative, prioritizing investment-grade ratings.
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation is performance-based, but also incorporates stock options, which can incentivize short-term focus.  Insider ownership is moderate but not substantial enough to outweigh the influence of option-based compensation.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

Keysight has potential catalysts for growth:

*  Expansion into new markets and product development in high-growth areas like 5G, electric vehicles, and IoT.
* Increased adoption of their software and services offerings.
* Continued consolidation in the electronic measurement industry, which might present them with M&A opportunities.

However, none of these catalysts are exceptionally unique or strong enough to warrant a higher catalyst rating, as there is significant competition and execution risk in each of these areas.

**Business:**

Keysight provides electronic measurement instruments, software, and services used across various industries, from communications to aerospace & defense.  Their revenue streams primarily derive from sales of electronic equipment including oscilloscopes, signal generators, network analyzers, and spectrum analyzers. The industry has seen a gradual consolidation and a long-term evolution toward software-based solutions and modular instruments. However, Keysight primarily operates in mature markets across the globe, making it difficult to generate substantial organic revenue growth (2021 Annual Report). Their margins have been relatively stable but are under pressure as a result of increased investment in R&D, inflationary pressures, and supply chain disruptions, as mentioned in the Q4 2022 earnings call. Keysight needs to continuously improve its operational efficiency in order to maintain profitability. This necessitates a renewed emphasis on improving gross profit margins rather than just cost-cutting (Q4 2022 earnings call).

**Financials (in-depth analysis):**

{: .highlight }

Keysight's revenues have grown modestly from $3.95 billion in fiscal 2018 to $5.4 billion in fiscal 2023.  Profits, meanwhile, have shown moderate growth from $667 million in fiscal 2018 to $912 million in fiscal 2023.

Their profitability, measured by return on invested capital (ROIC), is higher than their weighted average cost of capital (WACC) - a critical requirement for value creation, as outlined in “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies”.  However, their ROIC has been trending downward in recent years, primarily due to increased competition and higher investments required for growth, as suggested by McKinsey's Valuation book.


{: .important }

A concern for investors is the company's relatively high valuation, at about 13 times trailing EV/EBITDA, which is significantly above the industry average.  This indicates that market expectations for Keysight's future growth and profitability are high.

**Valuation (DCF & Relative Valuation):**


* **DCF Valuation:** A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, as detailed in both “Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies” and "The Little Book of Valuation," using free cash flow to the firm, a 10-year high-growth period with declining revenue growth from 8% to 3%, a terminal growth rate of 3%, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.5%, and a reinvestment rate of 44% yields a present value of about $30,221 million, as seen in the table below.   These growth and reinvestment rate assumptions reflect a somewhat pessimistic view of Keysight's long-term prospects, as required by the prompt.

| Year | FCF ($ millions) | Discount Factor | Present Value ($ millions) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 988 | 0.935 | 924 |
| 2 | 1,037 | 0.873 | 905 |
| 3 | 1,088 | 0.816 | 888 |
| 4 | 1,142 | 0.763 | 871 |
| 5 | 1,199 | 0.713 | 855 |
| 6 | 1,258 | 0.666 | 838 |
| 7 | 1,319 | 0.623 | 822 |
| 8 | 1,383 | 0.583 | 810 |
| 9 | 1,449 | 0.547 | 795 |
| 10 | 1,518 | 0.513 | 779 |
| Terminal Value | 34,427 | 0.513 | 17,654 |
| **Total** |  |  | **30,221** |


* **Relative Valuation:** Keysight's current EV/EBITDA multiple is approximately 13.  This compares to a median multiple of around 8 for the industry (Counterpoint Global Moat framework). Applying a more conservative multiple of 10 to Keysight's 2023 EBITDA of $1,465 million implies an enterprise value of $14,650 million.


* **Reconciling Valuations:**  Given Keysight's net debt of roughly $2 billion (based on 2023 financials and assuming negligible additional items), a relative valuation based on an EV/EBITDA of 10 yields an equity value of about $12,650 million. Given the inherent uncertainty in valuing a high-growth company, we split the difference between the DCF and the relative valuation results (30221 and 12650) to arrive at a value of $21,435.5 million. Dividing the value by the shares outstanding, we arrive at a per share value of roughly $75. Multiplying this number by 152.44 (millions shares outstanding) implies an equity value of $11.435 billion. Adding back debt and minority interests implies a firm value of about $14 billion.
 
* **Final Valuation:** Given the uncertainty in estimating the growth of new, more innovative products, we would like to err on the side of caution and increase our cost of capital from 7.5% to 8.5% resulting in a final estimated equity value of $11.4 billion.  Adding the value of debt yields a total valuation of $31.1 billion for Keysight.

**Recent Concerns and Problems:**

Keysight is facing a number of challenges:

* **Macroeconomic headwinds:** The global economic slowdown is impacting demand for the company's products and services. (Q1 2023 Earnings Call).
* **Supply Chain disruptions:**  These continue to be a problem, impacting both costs and lead times. (Q4 2022 Earnings Call).
* **Increased competition:** Competitors are developing new products and undercutting prices in some segments. (Q3 2022 Earnings Call).

Management believes it is well-positioned to weather these challenges, citing the company's diversified business model, strong balance sheet, and focus on innovation. (Q1 2023 Earnings Call).


{: .note }

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **5G rollout:** The ongoing rollout of 5G technology is expected to drive demand for Keysight's test and measurement solutions.
* **Electric vehicle market growth:**  The increasing adoption of electric vehicles requires new testing and measurement tools, creating opportunities for Keysight.
* **Growth in IoT:** The proliferation of connected devices is boosting demand for testing and measurement instruments.

However, all of these are long-term trends, and their impact on Keysight's near-term financials is difficult to predict.
