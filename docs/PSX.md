Phillips 66 is a downstream energy company operating primarily in refining, midstream, marketing and specialties, and chemicals.  The company’s significant scale and integration across these segments offer some cost advantages, but the downstream energy sector is highly competitive, limiting its moat.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5)**

Phillips 66's primary source of value comes from refining. Refining capacity can be a source of a mini-moat at a regional level, especially when it is integrated with a midstream network, such as pipelines and storage facilities.
> This aligns with the reasoning presented in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, where Pat Dorsey discusses the importance of identifying businesses with "economic moats" or sustainable competitive advantages. Regional mini-monopolies or oligopolies can be hard for competitors to replicate because of scale, and local advantages. 


However, refining is a cyclical and commoditized business, and these advantages can be short-lived.
> Refer to *Valuation* by Aswath Damodaran, where the challenges of valuing cyclical companies are discussed. Their earnings fluctuate significantly, making it difficult to estimate intrinsic value.

Additionally, Phillips 66's midstream and marketing segments benefit from economies of scale, but the overall sector profitability is still heavily influenced by commodity prices and market dynamics, which are largely beyond management's control.
> This is discussed in *Competitive Advantage* by Michael Porter, which emphasizes the importance of industry structure on profitability.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

Management's capital allocation decisions have been mixed, with some acquisitions and investments yielding good returns, while others haven't performed as well.
> This is akin to Michael Burry’s approach in analyzing investments, where he emphasizes not only the underlying financials but also management's actions and their strategic implications, as demonstrated in the provided Burry articles. He highlights the importance of identifying mistakes, and management mistakes are a key part of why investments underperform.


While management communication is generally transparent, they could provide more segment-level detail to provide greater insight to investors.
> This is in line with *Investor Communications* which emphasizes transparency.

Executive compensation seems aligned with performance, but insider ownership is moderate, which slightly reduces the incentive for management to act in the best interest of all shareholders. 
> This relates to the principal-agent problem discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, where management (agent) may not always act in the interests of shareholders (principal). 


**Catalyst Assessment (2/5)**

Potential catalysts for PSX include:
* Increased refining margins due to supply disruptions or increased demand. However, given refining’s cyclicality, these are likely to be temporary.
* Successful execution of growth projects in the midstream and chemicals segments. These offer some potential, but the competitive landscape in both is challenging.
> This cautious outlook reflects the difficulty of predicting industry dynamics, as discussed in the Little Book That Builds Wealth and The Little Book of Valuation.


**Valuation ($52.7 Billion)**

We employ a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach to value PSX, using the following assumptions and financial statements from PSX's 2022 10-K and 2023 10-Q:

1. **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue will grow at the rate of the global economy (2% real growth + 2% inflation = 4% nominal growth over the next five years and 2% thereafter in perpetuity). 
2. **Operating Margin:** We normalize operating margin to 8% (in line with past averages).
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume that the ratio of reinvestment to after-tax operating income will be 10%.
4. **Cost of Capital:** We use an estimated cost of capital of 7.6%. 
  - Risk-free rate: 4%
  - Equity Risk Premium: 4.5%
  - Beta: 1.3
  - After-tax cost of debt: 4.5%
  - Debt/Capital ratio: 25%
5. **Probability of Failure:** Given PSX's size and financial strength, we assess this probability as negligible.


**Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Operating Margin | EBIT ($B) | Reinvestment ($B) | Free Cash Flow ($B) | Discount Factor | PV of Free Cash Flow ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 60.2 | 8% | 4.82 | 0.48 | 4.33 | 0.929 | 4.03 |
| 2 | 62.6 | 8% | 5.01 | 0.5 | 4.51 | 0.863 | 3.89 |
| 3 | 65.1 | 8% | 5.21 | 0.52 | 4.69 | 0.801 | 3.76 |
| 4 | 67.7 | 8% | 5.41 | 0.54 | 4.87 | 0.743 | 3.62 |
| 5 | 70.4 | 8% | 5.63 | 0.56 | 5.07 | 0.689 | 3.49 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  | 126.17 | 0.689 | 87.00|
| **Present Value of Operating Assets** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **105.80** |


> **Note:** These calculations do not include the impact of other balance sheet items such as cash, debt and other non-operating assets/liabilities.

Adding back cash and marketable securities of $3.8 billion, non-operating assets of $1.2 billion and minority interests of $0.6 billion, and subtracting total debt of $20.7 billion, we arrive at a total value of $90.7 billion. 

> **Note:** We are subtracting the book value of debt from the DCF calculation of equity because this represents the obligations of all claimholders.

We incorporate the probability of failure (negligible) into the calculation and compute the per-share value using the 671 million shares outstanding in July 2023: ($90.7 billion/671 million shares) = $135.17/share. 

Then, given the latest share price of $117, we estimate a DCF value of the entire company, implying a value of 0.86 times the share price. To obtain a total value of Phillips66, we must reverse engineer that value: $117 x 0.86 = $100.62. Then, to derive the total market value of the company: $100.62 \* 671 = $67.5 Billion.  

**Concerns and Controversies**

Recent investor concerns have centered around:
* Refining margins compression due to cyclical factors and concerns about refining utilization.
* The impact of the energy transition on long-term demand for refined products.
* Capital allocation decisions, with some questioning the wisdom of recent growth projects in refining.

Management's response in the Q2 2023 earnings call has been to emphasize their commitment to returning cash to shareholders, defending their refining investments as strategically sound, and highlighting the company's diversified portfolio as a buffer against energy transition risks. They also noted that "the market is overlooking the resilience and longevity of our assets" (Mark Lashier, CEO, Q2 2023 earnings call).  

This response partially addresses investor concerns, but the proof will be in the long-term performance of these investments.

**Conclusion**

Phillips 66 seems fairly valued at its current price, with some upside potential if refining margins remain strong or growth projects deliver above-average returns. However, the lack of a wider moat and the cyclical nature of the business warrant a degree of caution and a margin of safety when investing in the company.  The lack of compelling catalysts and the uncertainty surrounding the refining sector further contribute to this cautious outlook.
