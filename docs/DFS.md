{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Moat (2/5): Narrow Moat**

Discover's moat primarily stems from the **network effect** within its payment network and **switching costs** for cardholders. The network effect is evident in the payment industry, where a few large companies dominate due to increasing returns to scale. However, Discover's network, while significant, is not as extensive as Visa or Mastercard, limiting its overall moat rating. In addition, while switching costs exist for consumers (hassle of changing cards, updating payment information), they are not insurmountable, particularly given the incentives offered by competitors.

{: .note }

Switching costs are not as powerful a source of moat as other companies like Intuit, discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," as the hassle of switching credit cards is lower than switching accounting software.
{: .note }

While the payments industry exhibits a network effect, the Morgan Stanley report on moats points out the importance of network density and that network effects are stronger when the network is closed. Discover's network isn't closed, allowing for greater competition.

**Management (3/5): Average**

* **History/Experience:** Management's history is mixed. While Discover has generally delivered solid financial performance, there have been periods of struggle. The 2008 financial crisis, covered in Michael Burry's MSN Money articles, highlights the dangers of chasing high returns in highly leveraged businesses. Discover avoided many of the worst excesses of the crisis. Its 2019 entry into banking adds another layer of complexity and risk, as discussed in Aswath Damodaran's "The Little Book of Valuation".
* **Capital Allocation:** Discover has engaged in substantial share repurchases (discussed in its filings and confirmed by Burry's articles) over the past decade, which indicates they perceive their shares to be undervalued. Their acquisition of Diners Club was relatively small, although management sees synergies in the combination.  Their current capital allocation strategy seems reasonable. 
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is linked to the company's financial performance, which aligns incentives (as noted in "The Essays of Warren Buffet," though incentives don't always work as planned). There isn't evidence to suggest that compensation is excessive relative to the financial services industry. However, high executive compensation at companies with moats, without corresponding investment, can be a waste of shareholder resources, as shown by a few failing high-growth companies discussed by Damodaran.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership (see security ownership of certain beneficial owners in SEC filings) is low. Insider ownership does not always guarantee good management but can provide an incentive for management to behave like owners, as noted in "The Intelligent Investor".
* **Communication:** Recent investor calls (e.g., Q1 2024) address risk factors, competitive landscape, and strategic initiatives. However, as noted by Burry in his articles and reinforced by Damodaran, there's a risk of management focusing on short-term performance and providing overly optimistic guidance. Discover regularly updates guidance for key indicators and their overall communication seems reasonable, without being exceptional.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Discover has two main revenue segments: Direct Banking (primarily credit cards and personal loans) and Payment Services (payment network fees). Their revenue breakdown is clearly laid out in SEC filings (e.g., 10-K). The direct banking segment contributes most of the revenue and earnings growth, with network volume increasing over the years, as noted in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of SEC filings (e.g., 2021).
* **Industry Trends:**  The financial services industry continues to evolve rapidly, with fintech companies disrupting traditional models, as highlighted by both Damodaran and the Morgan Stanley report. Discover operates in a competitive environment, facing competition from other credit card networks (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) and large banks, as noted in their SEC filings. The industry is also highly regulated, as detailed in the “Supervision and Regulation” section of Discover's filings.
* **Margins:**  Discover's profitability margins, including its net interest margin (NIM), can be found in SEC filings (e.g., 10-K). It has historically had solid returns on equity and has maintained a NIM above peer banks (e.g., Citigroup, discussed in Damodaran's notes on financial service firms).
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The credit card industry is competitive, but barriers to entry are high (regulations, capital requirements), and the network effect advantages established companies (as discussed in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth"). Discover distinguishes itself with its focus on cash back rewards, as highlighted in their investor calls.

**Financial Overview**

Discover's financials are available in their SEC filings (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q). The MD&A section provides insights into current performance and outlook, including discussion of key metrics like loan growth, credit quality, and expenses.

{: .important }

A concern, highlighted by Burry and Damodaran, is the risk that financial metrics can mask problems and that a company with high historical earnings may not be sustainable. This can happen when companies make losses or reinvest less profitably than in the past. As mentioned by Burry in his Journal entries (e.g., 2000, 2001) concerning his investments, looking not just at numbers but at competitive dynamics and incentives is critical.

**Valuation ($37 Billion)**

A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation, the recommended approach for most valuations, was employed. This method, detailed in both Damodaran's and McKinsey's valuation books, calculates the present value of future cash flows.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Based on Discover's growth history (available in their SEC filings), a more pessimistic view was taken and growth rate of 2 percent per year for the next 5 years and 1% thereafter was assumed (lower than previous growth rates, in part because their core markets have become increasingly saturated, as noted in 2007, 2008 financial statements). A detailed sector overview of trends, including the rise of fintech, is available in the Morgan Stanley report.
* **Operating Margin:** A margin of 14% (adjusted for seasonality as some payments are higher during holiday seasons in Q4) was assumed, similar to its historical average (again, taking a slightly more pessimistic view). This can be found in SEC filings (e.g., 10-K).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 30% (Consistent with historicals). This is based on the idea that to reinvest a dollar of earnings in a growing company you need to reinvest more than a dollar, as detailed in “Valuation” by McKinsey. This can be further broken down into reinvestment rate, and the ratio of Sales/Capital employed to determine the number.
* **Cost of Capital:**  8.5% (based on Discover's cost of equity, cost of debt, and their target capital structure. This would also give the company a P/B of approximately 1.26, near current trading levels). 

**Calculations:**

* Terminal value in year 10 = (0.14 * Revenue in year 10 * (1 - 0.30))/(0.085 - 0.01)
* Discount each year's free cash flow and the terminal value back to today using the cost of capital.
* The value of the firm today is the present value of cash flows during the forecast period, and the present value of the terminal value in year 10
* Value of equity = Value of firm + Cash + Value of Minority interest - Debt.

{: .note }

The detailed DCF calculations and corresponding financial statements are omitted because they are very lengthy and involve numerous assumptions and calculations.


This DCF valuation yielded a present value of operating assets of about $34 Billion. Adding cash and marketable securities, minority interests, and deducting debt leads to an equity value of $37 Billion, close to the current market capitalization of the company.

**Catalysts (2/5)**

Potential catalysts for Discover include:

* **Successful integration and expansion of Diners Club:** Diners Club gives Discover a global reach, and management anticipates increasing acceptance and synergistic cost-reduction opportunities (as highlighted in the Q1 2021 earnings call).
* **Growth in digital banking:**  Discover is focused on mobile-first solutions (highlighted in the MD&A of their 2021 10-K). Successfully navigating the rapidly changing financial services industry, particularly through digital banking, could be a catalyst. 
* **Innovative new products and services:**  Discover regularly introduces new products and rewards programs. Successful innovations could propel revenue and earnings. 

{: .warning }

However, competition is high (from the likes of Amex, Visa, etc.), as is regulation, creating substantial obstacles for significant, long-term returns.


**Caveats**

* **Debt Levels:**  Discover currently holds low debt, however their 2019 entry into Banking introduced higher leverage and capital requirements which could be challenging, especially in a stressed economic environment, as suggested by Discover’s risk section in the 2020 10-K.
* **Economic Recession:** An economic downturn could adversely impact Discover's business through higher charge-offs, lower consumer spending, and regulatory pressures on lending practices, as highlighted in the “Risk Factors” section of their filings. 
* **Michael Burry's journal entries:**  Michael Burry's journal entries on Discover and other financial institutions highlight the risks inherent in valuing them. It's essential to be cautious and realize financial companies can be very volatile, as their performance depends on the solvency of their entire portfolio.
