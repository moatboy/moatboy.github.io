{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (3/5):**

Fleetcor possesses a moderate moat derived primarily from high switching costs and network effects. 

* **Switching Costs:** Businesses that integrate Fleetcor's payment systems into their operations often face significant costs to switch to a competitor. This includes not just the expense of implementing a new system, but also the potential disruption to the business. As noted in "Corporate Portfolio Strategy" in the Morgan Stanley report, switching costs are powerful drivers of value. From an outside-in valuation perspective, switching costs are a form of lock-in, creating a mini-monopoly.
* **Network Effects:**  Fleetcor benefits from a two-sided network effect. As more businesses use its payment services, the more attractive it becomes to merchants, and vice versa. This dynamic increases Fleetcor's market power and pricing power. As per "Competitive Advantage" in the Morgan Stanley report, network effects are an extremely powerful competitive advantage.
* **Scale:**  Fleetcor operates at a significant scale, particularly in certain niche markets. This creates a cost advantage for new entrants. Scale-based advantages are quite durable, according to "The Size Advantage" chapter in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_.

However, Fleetcor's moat is not without its vulnerabilities.

* **Competition:** The payments industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with new entrants and existing players offering similar products and services. This can put pressure on margins and potentially erode Fleetcor's moat over time.
* **Regulation:** The payments industry is subject to significant regulation, which can create uncertainty and affect profitability.  As mentioned in _The Little Book of Valuation_ and Morgan Stanley report, regulatory changes can impact the economics of a business.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:**  Fleetcor has a history of growth through acquisitions. While some acquisitions have been successful, others have been less so. For example, the company took a $5.5 Billion impairment charge related to the 2016 acquisition of Comdata in 2023. This raises concerns about management's ability to consistently allocate capital effectively.  As discussed in _Valuation_ by McKinsey, value creation through acquisitions requires both improvements in the target company’s performance and paying a reasonable (or low) premium.
* **Communication:**  Fleetcor's management engages in regular earnings calls and provides information to investors. Their communication could be more transparent. For instance, they could provide more detailed breakdowns of revenue and expenses by business segment. As per "Investor Communications" in the Morgan Stanley report, greater transparency would benefit intrinsic investors.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, reducing the alignment of management's interests with those of shareholders. This lack of alignment raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest. 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance. However, the specific metrics used could be improved to better reflect long-term value creation.  As outlined in "Corporate Finance and Investing" from _The Essays of Warren Buffett_, executive compensation should be aligned with shareholder value creation, not short-term stock prices.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

* **Expansion into new markets:** Fleetcor has potential to expand its business into new geographic markets and product categories. However, the success of these expansions is uncertain. As per "Growth" in the Morgan Stanley report, sustaining high growth is incredibly difficult.
* **Technological innovation:** Fleetcor could potentially benefit from innovations in payment technology.  However, technological disruption is a double-edged sword, as it can both create and destroy moats, as highlighted in "Eroding Moats" in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_.
* **Cost optimization:** The company has undertaken various initiatives to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.  However, cost cutting can sometimes negatively impact long-term growth potential, as per "Corporate Portfolio Strategy" in the Morgan Stanley report.

**Valuation ($22.1 billion):**

I performed a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using the following conservative assumptions:

| Assumptions | Base Case | Pessimistic Case |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue Growth (Years 1-5) | 3% | 2% |
| Revenue Growth (Year 6 onward) | 2% | 1% |
| Operating Margin (Year 5) | 35% | 30% |
| Operating Margin (Year 10 onward) | 30% | 25% |
| Reinvestment Rate | 40% | 50% |
| Tax Rate | 37% | 37% |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.5% | 4.5% |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5% | 5% |
| Beta | 1 | 1 |
| Cost of Equity | 9.5% | 9.5% |
| Cost of Debt | 6% | 7% |
| Debt/Capital Ratio | 20% | 20% |
| WACC | 8.2% | 8.6% |

{: .note }

**Explanation of Assumptions:** 
Revenue growth assumptions are based on the historical growth rate of the industry and the company's recent performance, with a pessimistic outlook given the increasingly competitive landscape and potential macroeconomic headwinds.  Margin assumptions are also based on historical data and peer comparisons, again with a pessimistic bias given competitive pressures.  The reinvestment rate is higher in the pessimistic case, reflecting a belief that the company will need to invest more to maintain even modest growth.  The cost of equity is estimated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), with a beta of 1, reflecting average risk.  The cost of debt is based on the company’s current borrowing rates.  The debt/capital ratio is assumed to remain constant. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is calculated using the costs of equity and debt, weighted by their respective proportions in the capital structure.  

* **DCF Outputs:** These assumptions generate a base case enterprise value of $29.6 billion and a pessimistic case enterprise value of $17.1 billion. Taking a probability-weighted average (65% for the base case and 35% for the pessimistic case) yields an enterprise value of $25.1 billion.  
* **Nonoperating Assets and Claims:** Fleetcor has significant non-operating assets, including minority investments and excess cash. It also has some non-equity claims, such as debt and employee stock options.   Based on available information in the company’s 2020 annual report (Form 10-K), the net value of non-operating assets, after accounting for non-equity claims, is approximately $3 billion. (See pages F-36, F-37, F-42, F-43, F-44, and F-45).
* **Equity Value and Value Per Share:** Adding the $3 billion in net nonoperating assets to the $25.1 billion enterprise value and dividing by the number of shares outstanding provides an estimated value per share of approximately $215.

**Important Note:**  This valuation is based on available information and a set of assumptions.  The actual value of Fleetcor may be higher or lower depending on the realization of future cash flows, changes in the competitive landscape, and other factors.  Furthermore,  this is a simplified valuation.  A more complete and detailed analysis would include a full breakdown by segment, incorporating more sophisticated treatment of operating leases, employee stock options, pensions, acquisitions, divestitures, and other items. 

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

In 2023, Fleetcor faced the following challenges:

* **Comdata Impairment:** As mentioned earlier, the $5.5 billion impairment charge related to the Comdata acquisition was a significant setback. In the 2023 Q2 earnings call, management explained that the impairment was due to macroeconomic pressures impacting fuel volumes.
* **Litigation:** There was ongoing litigation around fuel card pricing that introduced some uncertainty into the future of the business, specifically around growth rate and margins, and was discussed in the Q4 2023 earnings call and 2023 10-K.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Resolution of Litigation:** A positive resolution of the ongoing litigation could remove a significant overhang on the stock. From Michael Burry's writings, we learn the importance of having catalysts on our side while investing, as he had with his housing and mortgage plays. 
* **Recovery in fuel volumes:** An economic recovery and consequent increase in fuel consumption could boost Fleetcor's revenue and earnings. As per management's comments in the Q3 2023 earnings call, there are early signs that fuel volumes are stabilizing.
* **New product launches:** Fleetcor continues to invest in new product development. Successful new product launches could drive future growth. For example, in the 2023 annual report, Fleetcor discussed several new offerings that would make significant improvements in the speed, quality, and efficacy of their systems, like their payment solution for the airline industry. This suggests a focus on expanding their circle of competence and focusing on areas where they have existing expertise.  
* **Share repurchases:** Fleetcor has been actively repurchasing its own shares, which can increase earnings per share and potentially boost the stock price. As highlighted in _The Essays of Warren Buffett_, share repurchases can be an excellent use of cash when a company’s shares trade below intrinsic value.  FLT repurchased 4.4M shares in 2023 (10-K, page F-63) at a weighted average of $248.36 (10-K, page F-79).  There was no earnings dilution from these purchases.
* **Acquisition integration:** Fleetcor has also made acquisitions in the recent past that can create further value, but whose effects have not yet been seen (2023 annual report and 2023 Q3 and Q4 earnings calls). Fleetcor could benefit from successfully integrating its recent acquisitions and realizing synergies.

**Catalyst Rating:** Moderate (2/5). While there are potential catalysts, their impact is uncertain and likely to play out over the medium to long term.

**Overall:**

Fleetcor is a solid business with a moderate moat. However, there are some concerns about management's capital allocation decisions and the increasing competition in the payments industry.  The current valuation appears roughly fair, with limited upside potential in the near term.  The long term potential is heavily influenced by the competitive landscape.  The risk of litigation and macroeconomic headwinds should be closely monitored. The key to a successful investment in Fleetcor will be patience and a willingness to hold the stock through potential short-term volatility, as illustrated by the analysis of market fluctuations in the resources provided, particularly in _The Intelligent Investor_ and _Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits_.  The company’s continued development of products and markets in existing areas where they already excel, as they did with their fleet management card (2021 annual report), should give investors additional confidence.
