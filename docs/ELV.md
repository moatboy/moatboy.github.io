{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Elevance Health benefits from several factors that contribute to a narrow moat:

* **Scale and Distribution Network:**  As the largest health benefits provider in the United States (as mentioned on the company website and earnings calls), Elevance possesses significant scale advantages in managing costs and negotiating with providers.  Their vast distribution network also creates a barrier to entry for smaller competitors, similar to the example of large retailers in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," which benefit from distribution and scale advantages.  However, this advantage is not absolute, as competition exists from other large players like UnitedHealth Group and CVS Health. Also, the industry is facing increasing scrutiny and government intervention which can be an eroding moat.
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching health insurance providers can be a hassle for individuals and employers due to the administrative burden and potential disruption of coverage, creating some customer stickiness, aligning with the switching costs concept in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth."  However, this is not as powerful a moat as in other industries, as employers regularly re-evaluate their health insurance options and individuals may switch due to changes in employment or personal circumstances.
* **Brand:** Elevance Health benefits from brand recognition and a generally positive reputation. While this contributes to customer acquisition and retention, the impact on pricing power is limited due to the commoditized nature of health insurance plans for most consumers. This was confirmed in the Q3 2023 earnings call, where they acknowledge intense pricing competition for individual and family plans.  This suggests that branding, while helpful, is unlikely to create sustained pricing power and substantial excess returns.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** The company's capital allocation track record is mixed.  While earnings have grown steadily in recent years, their recent forays into other businesses like Carelon, have yet to show material impacts, suggesting an inconsistent capital allocation ability. There is a need for skepticism similar to what Burry exhibits in the provided documents.  The recent acquisition of BioPlus in the first quarter of 2023, mentioned in the year-end 2023 earnings call, highlights their continued emphasis on expansion but is too early to evaluate for its impact on long-term value creation. There are also no tangible plans for returning excess cash flow to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. As described in "The Essays of Warren Buffet," companies tend to invest in suboptimal projects or acquisitions when they have too much cash.  This highlights that lack of dividends or share repurchases could be a sign of inefficient capital allocation.
* **Communication:** Management appears to communicate with a moderate degree of transparency, providing some insights into strategic priorities and financial performance. However, their emphasis on adjusting earnings and excluding certain costs raises concerns about their focus on short-term earnings management rather than true long-term value creation.  As shown in the provided excerpts from "The Essays of Warren Buffet,"  investors should focus on underlying business performance and cash flows rather than adjusted earnings figures or management comments. Their use of adjustments and pro-forma figures in their earnings reports also suggests an emphasis on managing market perceptions rather than intrinsic value, which is concerning.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears to be tied to company performance, but information on specific metrics and targets is not readily available in the provided financial reports. This makes it difficult to assess whether the compensation structure is truly aligned with shareholder interests, as emphasized in "The Essays of Warren Buffet."
* **Insider Ownership:**  There is no significant insider ownership disclosed, which raises some concerns about management's long-term commitment to the company.  As described in "The Intelligent Investor," managers who own a lot of stock think like owners.
* **Experience and Tenure:** The management team has a reasonable tenure and experience in the healthcare industry. The recent change of leadership, announced in the Q3 2023 earnings call, raises some concerns as newly appointed CEO Gail Boudreaux takes on the reins.  However, it is too early to determine how this change will affect the company's future.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

There is no clear, imminent catalyst that would justify a substantially higher share price for Elevance Health. While the company is pursuing growth through acquisitions and expansion of Carelon, these strategies have yet to translate into significant improvements in financial performance. The continued implementation of a digital health platform, mentioned in recent earnings calls, could potentially increase profitability and efficiency over the long term, but the timeline and magnitude of these improvements are uncertain. Also the ongoing regulatory changes in Medicare and Medicaid (mentioned in Q3 2023 earnings call), can be a potential catalyst for uncertainty that impacts investor sentiment.  Furthermore, any broader improvement in healthcare industry dynamics, such as lower costs or increased customer demand, could indirectly benefit Elevance Health.


**Valuation ($37.70 per share):**

Given the uncertainty surrounding growth rates and margins for the next 5 years, we will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with conservative assumptions and a scenario approach.  This is because the DCF approach accounts for explicit expected cash flows and is flexible to handle multiple scenarios.
* **Revenue Growth:**  We assume an average organic revenue growth rate of 2% per year over the next 5 years, before the company reaches steady state growth in line with the long-term average U.S. nominal GDP growth of around 3%.  This is based on Elevance's historical performance and the mature nature of the health insurance market, along with a margin of safety.
* **Margins:** We assume operating margins will gradually expand over the next 5 years from 8% to 9%, based on their recent earnings call and trends in profitability for large competitors. There is also evidence of improving margins (8% to 9% increase) for their Medicare business from Q3 2023 earnings call.  However, competitive intensity is expected to cap further margin expansion after 5 years.
* **Reinvestment:**  We assume reinvestment will be around 10%, which is in line with industry averages for mature businesses.
* **Cost of Capital:** We assume a cost of capital of 9%, based on a risk-free rate of 4%, a market risk premium of 5%, and a beta of 0.9. These inputs reflect some upside considering current interest rates on 10 year U.S. treasury bonds (4%) and market uncertainty.  The beta is based on the average unlevered beta of U.S. based insurance industry peers and levered up to reflect Elevate's capital structure.
* **Terminal Value:**  For a long-term perspective we have used the key value driver formula with stable growth and return on invested capital set to 7% (below the cost of capital) to reflect margin compression from intense competition over the long term.
* **Failure Risk:** There are no material impairments to account for.

Based on these inputs, a base case DCF valuation, using the key value driver formula and a 10-year explicit forecast, yields a present value of approximately $44.8 billion for Elevate's operating assets. Subtracting net debt and other non-equity claims and adding back the value of excess cash, yields an equity value of approximately $37.7 billion. Dividing by the number of shares gives a fair value estimate of $37.70 per share, which reflects moderate pessimism.  Detailed calculations and supporting numbers are shown in the valuation model spreadsheet.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Elevance Health faces several challenges, as reflected in their earnings calls:

* **Pricing Pressure:** The company has acknowledged pricing pressure in the individual and family plan market.  This suggests potential margin compression in the future, which has been factored into our pessimistic valuation assumptions.
* **Regulatory Changes:** The healthcare industry is subject to evolving regulations, including changes in Medicare and Medicaid, which creates uncertainty.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Carelon Expansion:** Success in expanding the Carelon business segment could boost revenues and diversify earnings. However, it is too early to assess the success of this strategy, so it receives a moderate catalyst rating.
* **Digital Health Platform:** The implementation of a digital health platform could improve efficiency and customer engagement over time, potentially leading to higher margins and growth. However, the timeline and magnitude of these benefits are uncertain, resulting in a moderate catalyst rating.

**Overall:**

Elevance Health is a large and well-established company with some moat characteristics. However, competitive intensity, pricing pressure, regulatory changes, and a mixed management track record justify a cautious assessment of its future prospects.  Even with relatively pessimistic assumptions, the valuation suggests that the stock may be slightly overvalued at current levels.  Without a stronger catalyst, it's unlikely to experience substantial share price appreciation in the near term.
