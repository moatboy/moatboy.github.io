>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

Target's moat is narrow, primarily stemming from its brand name and scale. While these factors create some customer stickiness, they are not insurmountable. Brand loyalty in retail is fickle and can be eroded by factors like pricing and shifting consumer preferences. Its scale, while providing some cost advantages, is not as significant as some other large retailers, particularly in the current online retail environment. Target's smaller store footprint compared to competitors such as Walmart also limits its scale advantage in certain geographic areas.

**Management Assessment (2/5):**

Target's management faces challenges in navigating a rapidly changing retail landscape, particularly in adapting to the growth of e-commerce and maintaining competitive pricing and margins. Recent financial results have been somewhat disappointing, with declining revenues and earnings in 2023.

* **History/Experience:** Target has a long history in retail, but its recent struggles suggest that management has not fully adapted to the shift to online retail.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is linked to earnings and stock performance, potentially incentivizing short-term focus over long-term value creation.
* **Insider Ownership:** Although insider ownership exists, it's not at levels that suggest exceptional alignment with shareholder interests.
* **Communication:** Management's communication regarding long-term plans and initiatives could be more transparent and detailed.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** Large investments in areas like digital transformation and supply chain management are essential, but the effectiveness of these investments in driving long-term value creation remains to be seen. Target's recent share repurchases, while returning cash to shareholders, may have been conducted at valuations that were too high.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Target's revenues primarily come from its retail store network and digital sales. Food and beverages, beauty, home furnishings and décor, apparel and accessories, and hardlines make up its five core merchandise categories.
* **Industry Trends:** The retail industry is highly competitive and undergoing significant disruption from e-commerce. Inflation and changing consumer preferences pose additional challenges. Consolidation and localization are also becoming prominent trends in certain retail sub-sectors. 
* **Margins:** Target's margins have been under pressure from increased competition and rising costs. Management has outlined plans to improve operating margins through cost-cutting measures, but it is unclear whether these initiatives will be successful in the long term.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Target faces intense competition from Walmart, Amazon, and other large retailers. It differentiates itself by emphasizing its "cheap chic" brand image, omnichannel experience, and Target Circle loyalty program.
* **Recent Concerns/Controversies:** Target faced controversy and boycotts earlier in 2023 due to LGBTQ+ merchandise decisions. This impacted short-term sales and could have implications for its brand image.

**Financial Overview:**

Target's financial statements for the fiscal years ending February 2, 2024, January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and February 1, 2020 have been used for valuation.

>Note that I have made adjustments for the acquisition of Shipt in 2017 and the effects of certain other acquisitions on Target's historical sales, revenues and capital allocation. I have included the acquisition of Shipt as part of Non-recurring items.

Target's revenues have been declining over the past few years.  Margins have also been compressed, and the company posted an operating loss in 2023.  Although cash flow from operations has been positive, free cash flow to firm and cash flow to equity have been negative in 2023 due to high levels of capital expenditures and share buybacks. While earnings and ROIC have been under pressure in recent years, the overall industry seems to be recovering, with improving margins.

**Valuation:**

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume Target's revenues will grow at 2% annually over the next five years and stabilize at 1% growth thereafter. (Pessimistic outlook given recent trends and intense competition.)
* **Target Margin:**  5% (Management's stated goal in the Q3 2020 earnings call, but achieving this in a sustained manner is uncertain.)
* **Sales to Capital:** 1.5 (Target's long-term average.)
* **Tax Rate:** 25%
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (Risk-free rate + equity risk premium for retail.)
* **Probability of Failure:** 10% (Reflecting the challenging retail environment and Target's recent struggles.)
* **Liquidation Value:** $23 billion (Roughly half of the book value of Target's assets, a conservative assumption.)

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast:** A five-year explicit forecast of Target's income statement, balance sheet, and free cash flow was built using the aforementioned assumptions.
2. **Terminal Value:** We compute terminal value using the perpetuity growth formula with a growth rate of 1% and a cost of capital of 9%.
3. **Present Value of Cash Flows:** Discounted the forecasted free cash flows and the terminal value back to the present using the cost of capital.
4. **Probability-Weighted Value:** Calculated a probability-weighted value of the firm, taking into account the 10% probability of failure and the liquidation value.
5. **Equity Value:** Subtracted market value of debt and minority interest from the firm value. Added back cash and marketable securities.
6. **Value per Share:** Divided the equity value by the number of diluted shares outstanding.

| Year | Revenue ($B) | Operating Margin | EBIT ($B) | Reinvestment | FCFF | Cost of Capital | PV |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 94.4 | 5% | 4.7 | 2.35 | 2.35 | 9% | 2.17 |
| 2 | 96.3 | 5% | 4.8 | 2.40 | 2.40 | 9% | 2.01 |
| 3 | 98.2 | 5% | 4.9 | 2.45 | 2.45 | 9% | 1.86 |
| 4 | 100.2 | 5% | 5.0 | 2.50 | 2.50 | 9% | 1.73 |
| 5 | 102.1 | 5% | 5.1 | 2.55 | 2.55 | 9% | 1.60 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  |  |  | 53.3 |
| **Present Value of Operating Assets** |  |  |  |  |  |  | 61.6 |

>Value of operating assets = 61.6 B
>Cash = 6 B (based on Q3 2023 financials)
>Market value of debt and minority interest = 20 B (based on Q3 2023 financials)
>Value of the firm = 61.6 + 6 - 20 = 47.6 billion.
>Number of Shares Outstanding = 2.4 Billion (based on Q3 2023 financials)
>Equity Value = 47.6 B
>Probability of Failure=10% and Liquidation Value = 23 B

**(47.6*0.9) + (23*0.1) =  45.1 B**

Target’s Fair Value =  **45.14 B / 2.4 B = $18.8 per share**

**Catalysts (3/5):**

* **Improving Operating Performance:** Management has introduced initiatives to enhance operating efficiency, improve the supply chain, and increase same-store sales. Success in these areas could restore margins, reaccelerate growth, and drive cash flow, leading to a higher valuation.
* **E-commerce Growth:** Target's investments in its e-commerce platform and fulfillment capabilities are starting to yield results. Continued growth in online sales could become a significant driver of value creation.
* **Brand Revitalization:** Target is undertaking efforts to revitalize its brand and improve customer loyalty. Successful initiatives could strengthen Target's competitive position and enhance customer stickiness, potentially widening its narrow moat.
* **Share Repurchases:** Although I rate the current repurchases conducted at highly priced valuations in 2023 a mistake, share repurchases at lower price points can enhance shareholder value by reducing the number of shares outstanding. This could be a catalyst if shares fall significantly.

**Recent Financial Performance Commentary**

Target's management has stated in earnings calls that they will be investing more in supply chain and focusing on store experience and merchandise.
They also have outlined a three-year program of cost reductions and reinvestments to allocate resources to drive efficiency and growth.
In Q1 2023, Target’s operating income fell due to higher markdown rates, inventory shrink, and freight and transportation costs. This is concerning as it indicates that management may be prioritizing short-term profits over long-term value creation. The declining inventory levels seem temporary, but will they be enough to prevent a downward slide in margins? (Q1 2023 Earnings Call).

**Conclusion:**

Despite its well-known brand name, Target currently faces a challenging retail landscape.  Its narrow moat and management's recent execution issues are reflected in its declining financial performance. While the valuation suggests that the stock may be reasonably priced at current levels (considering the pessimistic assumptions used), the outlook remains uncertain given the company's near-term challenges.  Target's ability to restore margins, reaccelerate growth, and adapt to the changing retail environment will ultimately determine its future performance.
