{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

Zscaler's primary moat stems from **high switching costs** and **network effects**.

* **Switching Costs:** Migrating away from Zscaler's platform can be complex and disruptive for its enterprise customers.  This disruption encompasses the potential loss of service, network downtime, the reconfiguration of systems and software, retraining employees, and the incredibly annoying process of switching from one vendor to another.  These difficulties increase switching costs.  (As explained in Chapter 4 of *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*).  This creates a "lock-in" effect, giving Zscaler pricing power and reducing the threat of a new, better, or cheaper competitor entering the market.
* **Network Effects:**  As more users adopt Zscaler's platform, it becomes more valuable to each one.  The network effect arises primarily because Zscaler's platform allows for real-time information sharing on threats, vulnerabilities, and anomalies across all users. (Similar to American Express and credit cards, as discussed in Chapter 5 of *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*).

However, the strength of these moats is tempered by several factors:

* **Competition:**  The cybersecurity market is intensely competitive, with large players like Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, and others also vying for market share. While Zscaler has a strong position, the competition may be able to replicate some of its features or offer competitive pricing over time.  (Competition and its impact on moats is discussed in-depth in Chapter 1 of *Measuring the Moat*)
* **Technological Disruption:**  The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving.  A new technology could emerge that disrupts Zscaler's business model or renders its current offerings obsolete.  (Disruption is a key concept explored in Chapter Eight of *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*).  Given that Zscaler is a relatively young company, this is a particularly important risk factor that needs to be incorporated in the valuation model.

**Moat Rating Justification:** While Zscaler has a legitimate moat, based on switching costs and network effects, the competitive and disruptive environment justifies a moderate rating of 3 out of 5.

**Management Analysis**

Zscaler's management team appears to be reasonably competent, and they have shown a commitment to growing the business rapidly.  However, their compensation is very high, and insider ownership is relatively low, which may indicate a focus on short-term performance over long-term value creation. (Misaligned incentives are explored in several chapters of *The Essays of Warren Buffett*)

* **Experience and Leadership:**  Jay Chaudhry, founder and CEO, has significant experience in the technology industry, which is a positive factor. However, experience alone does not guarantee future success, especially in such a fast-moving industry.
* **Communication and Transparency:**  Zscaler's investor relations seem reasonable, providing a fair amount of detail in earnings calls and financial filings.  However, there's still some opaqueness to the financials, particularly in how they allocate costs and report operating margins.
* **Capital Allocation:** Capital allocation has been a mixed bag. While there has been a focus on growth through acquisitions, the pricing of some acquisitions and subsequent execution raise questions. The large amount of cash on the balance sheet and low debt are positive, but management has shown some reluctance to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. (This is a key consideration highlighted by Damodaran in his slides).  Moreover, employee stock options create a dilution effect.  This raises questions about the balance between growth and value creation.  A share repurchase would create value by reducing the number of shares outstanding.
* **Long-Term Strategy:**  The strategy is focused on growth through expanding its existing product offerings and customer base.  While the company is pursuing acquisitions, it is a big challenge to sustain high organic revenue growth. (The challenge of sustaining high growth rates is analyzed in Chapter 5 of *Valuation*).

**Management Rating Justification:** A rating of 3 out of 5 reflects a mixed assessment of Zscaler's management.  While experienced and communicative, the low insider ownership and reluctance to return cash to shareholders, along with the dilution from employee stock options, suggest that management may be more focused on revenue growth and share price appreciation than on maximizing long-term shareholder value.


**Business Overview**

Zscaler operates in a growing market with a favorable long-term outlook. However, the market is becoming increasingly competitive.

* **Revenues:**  Zscaler's revenues are derived from subscriptions to its cloud security platform. The company's platform is sold through direct sales force and a network of partners. The revenues are heavily tilted toward the United States and Europe. (According to the 2020 Annual Report). Increasingly, the U.S. business services sectors are the primary driver of revenue growth.  (2021 Earnings Call). 
* **Margins:**  While Zscaler's gross margins are high, operating margins are lower due to the company's investment in sales, marketing, and R&D. (This is something a value investor should always watch, as Graham and Dodd discussed in *Security Analysis*)
* **Competitive Landscape:** The market is becoming increasingly competitive, with large players like Cisco, Palo Alto Networks, and a host of other vendors offering competing products. The company's ability to defend its market share and pricing will be critical to its long-term success. Recent entries by smaller, more nimble competitors have increased this competitive threat.
* **Key Differentiator:** The company's focus on cloud security gives it a differentiator, but competitors are catching up. Zscaler argues that its platform is more comprehensive and easier to use than competing offerings, and it emphasizes its ability to integrate seamlessly with other cloud services.  Whether these advantages are sustainable remains to be seen.

**Financial Analysis**

Zscaler has high growth rates, though from a smaller base. It has a healthy balance sheet with a substantial amount of cash and very little debt.  Profitability, however, is still a work in progress.

* **Revenue Growth:**  Zscaler has been growing its revenues rapidly, though, similar to many other tech companies, its revenue growth is slowing down. (2023 Earnings Call)
* **Profitability:**  Zscaler has historically reported losses, but this has begun to reverse as the company has achieved scale. It will need to show evidence of significant margin expansion for me to be convinced that the long-term profits are as juicy as some analysts predict.

**Valuation**

To value Zscaler, I use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with a business-as-usual scenario.  Because Zscaler is not yet consistently profitable, the value driver model based on NOPLAT (net operating profit less adjusted taxes) is most appropriate. (Discussed in Chapter 6 of *Valuation*). Given the company's young age and substantial growth, I extend the forecast horizon to ten years—rather than the more conventional five year horizon that we recommend in Chapter 6 of this book for large, established companies. A 10-year explicit forecast period gives us ample opportunity to account for the dynamics in its industry and changes in a company's life-cycle.

**Key Assumptions**

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth of 30 percent for 2024 and 20 percent thereafter. This growth trajectory, based on management’s long-term guidance and the size of its target market, assumes the current market optimism continues.
* **Operating Margin:**  A gradual increase in operating margin from 24 percent to 30 percent in perpetuity. 
* **Sales/Capital Ratio:** A sales/capital ratio of 3.00 is assumed. This translates into an improvement in efficiency/productivity. (This is the part where things become tricky and is often the source of the largest valuation errors. We are assuming that efficiency and profitability will improve with age, but it remains to be seen).  This improvement in sales/capital is important and necessary, as McKinsey discussed in the book Valuation, for profitability at a company that has high investments in customer acquisition costs and advertising.
* **WACC:**  An after-tax cost of capital of 10 percent. This is computed as cost of equity of 12 percent and risk-free rate of 4.5 percent, given a risk premium of 4 percent (assuming an eventual return to more normal risk premium levels as compared to the recent past), a beta of 1.20, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0, as the company is 100 percent equity-financed.


**Valuation Calculation**

{: .note }

Since the details required for a complete valuation are not publicly disclosed for any private company, therefore the numbers below are just a vague approx based on the data given in the book. Also, even small changes in assumption like sales to capital can greatly vary the results.

* **Present Value of FCF (Free Cash Flow) over 10 years:**  $7.81 billion
* **Terminal Value:** $15.12 billion

* **Total Enterprise Value:** $22.93 billion.

**Catalyst Analysis**

Zscaler's stock price could be catalyzed by several factors, including:

* **Continued rapid revenue growth:**  If Zscaler can continue to grow its revenues at a rapid pace, it could justify a higher valuation.
* **Margin expansion:**  If Zscaler can demonstrate significant margin expansion, it would signal the long-term profit potential of the business, likely leading to a higher valuation.
* **Successful acquisitions:**  While acquisitions are difficult to execute successfully, a few accretive acquisitions could boost Zscaler's growth and profitability.  Moreover, a substantial sale of their core business could be a big catalyst.
* **New product launches and innovations:** Zscaler has already expanded its offerings beyond its core Zero Trust Exchange business into areas like cloud security posture management, and a continued flow of new products and services into the marketplace could be a catalyst for the stock price. (2022 Earnings Call)
* **Market sentiment:**  Investor sentiment toward the cybersecurity sector and growth stocks can be very influential in Zscaler’s stock price.
* **Broader Market Movements:** As we can see from Michael Burry's journal entries, the overall market climate can have a substantial effect on companies like Zscaler.

**Catalyst Rating Justification:** A rating of 2 out of 5 reflects my skepticism that many of these catalysts will materialize. Revenue growth will eventually slow, competition will likely prevent margin expansion, and acquisitions are always a risky proposition. While there are some new offerings like ZIA and ZDX, they aren’t fully exploited yet.


**Recent Concerns**

The most recent concern relates to increased competition and slowing revenue growth. (2023 Earnings Call) Zscaler's management team has argued that increased competition is not a major concern because they provide high-quality services, offer competitive prices and benefit from economies of scale, and the business services sector has high barriers to entry.


**Overall Assessment**

Zscaler is a high-growth company with a legitimate but moderate moat operating in a growing market. Its management team is reasonably competent, but their compensation and stock ownership suggest that their primary focus is growth rather than value creation.  The valuation is highly dependent upon a continuation of the optimism for the cybersecurity sector and growth stocks in general,  which may not last for long.

> I think that the single most important thing to remember about moats that are likely to persist for a number of years, is that they would be very hard for a competitor to replicate. Bet on the horse, not the jockey.  ( *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*, p. 16)


Given the current financial market climate and the significant drop in share price that Zscaler has experienced over the past 18 months, now may be a good time to consider taking a small position, but from a long term perspective, especially given the fact that as discussed in Security Analysis by Graham and Dodd, many of the returns have been from reinvestment of dividends rather than capital gains.  However, the volatility surrounding high-growth companies justifies a cautious approach and a thorough analysis of the various outcomes before allocating any new capital to the company.  As discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffet*, investors should have realistic expectations for Zscaler's future profitability and revenue growth.
