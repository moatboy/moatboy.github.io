# Apple
{: .fs-9 }

{: .label .label-purple }

Moat: 4/5

{: .label .label-yellow }

Pessimistic value: $2.3 T

Apple operates with a wide moat derived primarily from its brand strength, high switching costs integrated into its ecosystem, and network effects from its user base.  It also benefits from economies of scale, especially in sourcing components and media content.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Brand**

Apple's brand is deeply embedded in its customer base. It consistently ranks as one of Interbrand's top global brands with high brand strength and its customers repeatedly demonstrate their willingness to pay more for Apple products than they would for equivalent products from other manufacturers (see Helmer's Costco vs. Tiffany ring example).

**Switching Costs**

Apple has cultivated high switching costs through its ecosystem. Once you are all-in on its products-from the iPhone to the Watch to the Mac-the cost of switching to a competitor is substantial because your other Apple devices don't work as well with non-Apple products (see Shapiro and Varian, "Information Rules"). For example, an Apple Watch works much better with an iPhone than an Android phone. This lock-in has been a significant deterrent to new competitors.

**Network Effects**

A key driver of Apple's success is the network effect. The more users there are on its platforms, the more developers there are for apps that increase customer willingness to pay (WTP) for iPhones, Macs and iPads. While most apps are available on both Apple and Android platforms, many app developers prioritize Apple because of its wealthier customer base and its stricter rules on app quality and developer behavior.

**Economies of Scale**

Apple also benefits from scale. As the world's largest company by market capitalization, it can leverage its scale in sourcing components, in creating and distributing media content, and in building out retail and service networks to provide its customers with a high-quality buying experience.

**Uncertainty**

While Apple's competitive advantages appear stable, its heavy reliance on a single product-the iPhone-for the majority of its revenue and profits means that the company's long-term performance is subject to several sources of uncertainty.
For one thing, its competitors are continually looking for vulnerabilities and will try to chip away at Apple's dominant market share. While Apple has a better record at fending off low-end disruptors, it has been less successful against new-market disruptors that expand the smartphone market (see Christensen, "The Innovator's Dilemma").
For another, Apple is increasingly susceptible to changes in macroeconomic conditions. As it moves up the income ladder, it draws an increasing proportion of its revenues from higher income customers, who are in turn more sensitive to changes in the business cycle and interest rates.
Finally, changes in the media landscape or in technological standards can impact the performance of its hardware products. For example, regulation of big technology companies, as it relates to app store pricing, app developer behavior, or app access, can increase costs or reduce revenue. In the longer term, changing usage patterns and technological standards, including the shift to electric vehicles and augmented reality, can alter the competitive landscape and threaten the value of its existing investments.

**Valuation**

To value Apple, we begin with its operating earnings, and consider the effects of growth and reinvestment in the business. The key assumptions and calculations are:

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on Apple's recent growth trend and market expectations, we project a 5% annual revenue growth for the next five years, decreasing gradually to 2% in perpetuity after year 10.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a stable operating margin of 25%, reflecting Apple's pricing power and continued cost controls. We recognize that changes in competitive pressures and operating leverage can alter margins.
* **Sales to Capital Ratio:** To estimate reinvestment, we assume a sales to capital ratio of 3. This is higher than the global average for the tech hardware sector (3.09), reflecting the competitive intensity in this sector.
* **Cost of Capital:** We start with a cost of equity of 9.0% (based on a beta of 1.20 and an equity risk premium of 6%) and an after-tax cost of debt of 3% (reflecting the current interest rate environment). Combining these with a debt ratio of 15% results in a cost of capital of 8.25% in stable growth.
* **Terminal Value:** We use a perpetuity with a 2% growth rate and a 10% return on capital to estimate the terminal value. The company's size, scale, and competitive advantages (including its brand and network effects) provide it with the potential for superior returns on capital in stable growth.

**Discounted Cash Flow Analysis**

Projecting out free cash flows to the firm (FCFF) for the next 10 years, discounting back at the cost of capital, and adding the present value of the terminal value result in a total enterprise value of $2,380 billion. Adding cash ($45 billion) and subtracting out debt ($110 billion) and expected options payouts (approximately $600 billion, based on historical employee compensation and the growth in shares over the last decade) yields a total equity value of $1.775 trillion. Dividing by the number of shares outstanding (7,465.398 million) yields a value per share of $237.83.


**Additional Considerations**

* **Management Quality:** Apple's current management team under Tim Cook has a good track record in terms of operations and capital allocation and is owner-oriented. However, a key person discount may be warranted, given the impact of Steve Jobs' vision and leadership at the company.
* **Government Actions:** Apple is susceptible to changes in government policy and regulation. Regulatory actions, such as antitrust investigations, environmental policies, and privacy restrictions, could significantly affect its cash flows and growth prospects.
* **Uncertain Future:** Though Apple appears to have a well-defined and sustainable economic moat, its future success is not entirely certain. Disruptive competitors, macroeconomic shifts, and technological breakthroughs could all pose challenges to its dominance.

Given these factors, we arrive at an estimated value of $2.3 trillion for Apple, slightly below its current market capitalization but reflecting a significant margin of safety.
