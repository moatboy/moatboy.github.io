{: .highlight }

*   Elbit typically has a gross profit margin of around 28-30%. The operating margin stands at around 8% and the net margin tends to be around 5-7%. 
*   The company is a global leader in several of its niches, including the provision of electronic warfare and C4I systems and the manufacturing of high-end electronics for military aircraft and missiles.
*   The competitive landscape of this company is characterized by a few big players across the globe like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Raytheon, etc. but many smaller players, as well.
*   Elbit differentiates itself from competitors by having a variety of products across many industries, and by being a technological leader in those industries.
*   The company is in a period of transformation right now, with an emphasis on growing its core businesses and cutting its overall costs.

**Recent Concerns / Controversies**

*   The company experienced some fluctuations in cash flow due to changes in contract payment schedules.
*   There was a discussion of increasing competition in certain markets, requiring additional efforts in sales and marketing.

{: .important }
**Financial Analysis**
*   **Revenues**: Elbit generated a total revenue of approximately $5.3 billion in 2022, representing a ~7% increase from 2021. The revenue growth was especially strong in Europe, and Asia Pacific. The company has benefited from new contracts and the increase in existing contracts.
*   **Profitability:** However, there is a decrease in the net margin which has been primarily caused by a rise in operating expenses and interest expense.
*   **Cash Flow:** Cash from operations is very high. However, free cash flow is impacted by changes in working capital.
*   **Capital Structure**: The company has a moderate amount of debt, and appears to be conservatively financed. The equity base is also quite substantial, and it is primarily driven by retained earnings.
*   **Valuation**: Current price to earnings ratios are quite high compared to peers which might indicate that the company is overvalued.

{: .note }
**Moat Rating: 3/5**
Elbit Systems has a narrow moat based on several factors. These include, but are not limited to:
*   **Switching Costs:** The company benefits from the high switching costs, mainly for customers from its government segment. Once Elbit’s systems are integrated with the defense agencies’ existing infrastructure, they’re not easily switched out for a competitor’s offering. The high complexity of the programs and the need for constant collaboration further increase these switching costs.
*   **Intangible Assets**: Some level of advantage comes from its long operating history and strong brand recognition in several niches. The high reputation that comes from being an established, reputable brand with strong track records makes it difficult for newcomers to compete, especially in mission-critical applications. 
*   **Proprietary technology and R&D:** Elbit is a leader in certain segments and operates in the technology industry, where the costs of entry are high due to technological complexity. For example, the company invests a huge part of its earnings into R&D to make sure it stays ahead of its competitors.
*   While these factors enable Elbit to maintain a strong position in certain market segments, they are not impossible to replicate. Moreover, Elbit has a variety of different products, so the competitive advantages may vary across the different segments.

{: .warning }
**Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience**
*   **Dependence on Government Spending:** As a defense contractor, Elbit is heavily reliant on government defense budgets. If government spending on defense decreases, the company’s prospects could be impacted.
*   **Geopolitical Risks:** The company operates in politically volatile regions and is subject to political instability and potential disruptions. This is especially visible in Israel.
*   **Technological Change**: Given the fast-moving pace of the technological sector, the company will be challenged to keep on innovating at a high rate to avoid technological obsolescence by its competitors. Also, newer technological advancements that it was slow to adopt might also diminish existing moats.
*   **Competition**: Despite its competitive advantages, Elbit also faces tough competition in most of the market it operates. Competitors may be better priced, offer superior value, or become more innovative in future periods.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Disruptions in the supply chain, especially for specialized components, could cause delays in production and increase costs. These may limit the ability of Elbit to meet contract obligations on time.
*    **Cyber security:** The continued risk of cyber security attacks means that this area requires additional investment, which may increase expenses.

**Understandability Rating: 3/5**
Elbit’s business is fairly complex due to its presence in different regions and industries, as well as the large scope of the solutions it offers. The valuation is also quite complicated as the company is affected by global macroeconomic conditions, political landscape, and government defense spending. Overall, while the company's operations are not overly technical, financial reporting, and the analysis required to valuate the company are all somewhat complex for a lay investor.

{: .note }
**Balance Sheet Health Rating: 4/5**
Elbit appears to have a healthy balance sheet as of 2022 and 2021. The level of debt is moderate, but its overall health has also been improving over the past few years. While the company isn't debt-free, it is taking the steps to pay off debts which is also a positive trend. It also has a solid amount of cash. Overall, based on this, it seems like the balance sheet of Elbit Systems is fairly healthy.
