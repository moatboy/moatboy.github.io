{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

eBay's moat rating is 2 out of 5. While it enjoys network effects stemming from its large user base and brand recognition, the strength of this moat has weakened over time.

* **Network Effects:**  As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, network effects are powerful.  eBay benefits from the connections between its buyers and sellers – the more buyers, the more appealing the platform is to sellers, and vice versa. However, unlike closed networks, eBay's network is open, meaning competitors can attract participants and the strength of the network effect can be diluted. This is particularly true given the rise of other specialized marketplaces, and the overall increasing fragmentation of e-commerce. 
* **Brand Recognition:**  The eBay brand is widely recognized. However, brand recognition alone does not guarantee pricing power or sustained profitability, as discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. The prevalence of commodity products on eBay limits brand differentiation and price premiums.

**Management:**

eBay's management rating is 2 out of 5. While the current CEO, Jamie Iannone, joined in 2020 and brought with him experience in e-commerce and digital businesses, management's actions and communications haven't inspired high confidence.

* **Capital Allocation:**  eBay has been aggressively buying back shares, as revealed in the company's 10-Ks and 10-Qs. As discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*, share repurchases are only value-enhancing when the share price is below intrinsic value. eBay's share buybacks have occurred at what appear to be historically high multiples, raising concerns about capital allocation decisions. 
* **Communication:** While management claims to focus on long-term value, its actions speak louder than words.  There’s a disconnect between management’s rhetoric and its actions, especially in terms of capital allocation.  As Michael Burry's approach in the provided *MSN Money Articles* highlights, closely examining SEC filings alongside public pronouncements gives a fuller picture of managerial competence.

**Catalyst:**

eBay's catalyst rating is 1 out of 5.  There are no immediately apparent catalysts that could drive a significant re-rating in the near term.  The company is facing increasing competition and a maturing core business.

**Business:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** eBay's revenues are generated primarily from transaction fees (take rates) and advertising. These fees are assessed on gross merchandise volume (GMV), which encompasses the value of goods sold on the platform. The 10-K filings reveal that a substantial portion of eBay’s revenues (more than 50%) originates from outside the United States.
* **Industry Trends:** The e-commerce market is becoming increasingly competitive.  New entrants and the rise of specialized platforms are putting pressure on established players like eBay.
* **Margins:** eBay's operating margins have historically been strong, exceeding 20 percent. However, competition and reinvestment to maintain its market position have been putting pressure on margins.
* **Competitive Landscape:** eBay faces intense competition from other established e-commerce giants like Amazon, as well as smaller, niche players. Differentiating itself in this crowded marketplace remains a challenge.

{: .important }

eBay's dependence on a take-rate business model, where it profits from transaction fees rather than direct sales, presents both opportunities and challenges. This model benefits from scalability, as increased sales volume doesn’t require a proportionate increase in infrastructure or operations costs. However, this model also makes eBay vulnerable to price competition.

{: .warning }

There are several risk factors for eBay that must be considered. There is increasing competition from other e-commerce platforms; The global reach of eBay makes its sales, earnings, and cash flows susceptible to macroeconomic risks in numerous countries and currencies; And the company’s shift to managed payments brings additional risks and opportunities.

**Financials:**

eBay’s financials, available in its SEC filings, reveal a mature company with a relatively stable business.  Revenue growth has been sluggish, reflecting the maturity of the online auction market and increased competition.  The company has been using share repurchases to return cash to shareholders, but the high multiples at which these repurchases have occurred raise questions about capital allocation efficiency.  

{: .note }

During the second-quarter 2023 earnings call, the CEO noted the strategic importance of promoted listings, advertising solutions, and payments to eBay's overall strategy. He emphasized eBay's focus on non-new-in-box, a unique competitive advantage that other big e-commerce platforms are not prioritizing. He also announced partnerships to attract more buyers and sellers in specific categories, such as luxury goods.

**Valuation:**

To estimate eBay's intrinsic value, we used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.  We projected free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) for the next five years and a continuing value beyond.  We took a pessimistic view of eBay's prospects, assuming moderately declining revenues in line with the company's recent performance and a continuing operating margin and return on invested capital (ROIC) close to the cost of capital.  

**Key Assumptions (as of September 30, 2023):**

* **Revenue Growth:** 0% for the next five years, 2% thereafter 
* **Operating Margin:** 21%
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 65% of after-tax operating income 
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 9%
* **Marginal Tax Rate:** 21%


**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Free Cash Flow (FCFF):** Based on the assumptions above, we projected FCFF for the next five years and discounted these cash flows back to the present value at the WACC.

2. **Estimate Continuing Value:**  We used the perpetuity growth formula to estimate eBay's continuing value beyond the explicit forecast period.
    ```
    Continuing Value = (FCFF in terminal year * (1 + growth rate)) / (WACC - growth rate)
    ```

3. **Calculate Enterprise Value:**  The enterprise value is the sum of the present value of the next five years of free cash flow plus the present value of the continuing value.

4. **Calculate Value of Equity:** The value of equity is enterprise value minus debt and other non-equity claims.

5. **Calculate Value per Share:**  The value per share is simply the value of equity divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Based on these calculations, eBay's intrinsic value is approximately **$21.35 billion**, or **$35** per share.  This is lower than the current market capitalization, suggesting the stock may be overvalued.

{: .note }

This valuation is sensitive to the assumptions made.  A more optimistic outlook, particularly concerning revenue growth and margin stability, could yield a higher valuation.  Conversely, further competitive pressure or deterioration in the business could lead to a lower valuation.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

eBay has faced scrutiny for the high multiples at which its share repurchases have been occurring. This aggressive buyback program, while returning cash to shareholders, has raised concerns about capital allocation efficiency. The company is also facing increased competition in its core marketplace business, as mentioned in several earnings calls, which may put pressure on its revenue growth and margins.


**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

While eBay’s core business appears mature, potential upside could come from its focus on non-new-in-box goods, or if management succeeds in rejuvenating growth in its core marketplace business through innovations or acquisitions.  However, these are highly uncertain. Consequently, the current catalyst rating is low.
