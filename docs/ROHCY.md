## ROHCY | Moat: 3 / 5 | Understandability: 2 / 5 | Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5
ROHCY (Royce Global Value Trust Inc.) is a closed-end investment fund that primarily invests in a diversified global portfolio of securities that are undervalued.

{: .important } **Business Overview:**

Royce Global Value Trust Inc., or ROHCY, operates as a closed-end investment fund that seeks to provide shareholders with long-term capital appreciation. Unlike open-ended mutual funds, ROHCYâ€™s shares are traded on stock exchanges and its share count is typically fixed. This means that its share price can fluctuate based on market sentiment in ways that do not necessarily reflect the underlying value of its holdings. ROHCY has a diverse global portfolio, consisting primarily of stocks selected using a value investing strategy focusing on companies with strong underlying businesses.

{: .important } **Revenue Distribution & Trends:**

As an investment fund, ROHCY's primary source of "revenue" is investment returns and the fluctuations in its asset value.
   * **Investment Returns:** The fund earns returns from dividends, interest payments, and the capital appreciation (or depreciation) of its holdings.
   * **Expense Ratio:** ROHCY has an expense ratio of 1.00%, which, compared to other funds, is slightly on the higher end.
   * **Distribution Yield:** The fund typically offers a distribution yield (or dividend) around 4.8%.
   * **NAV Fluctuations:** Unlike traditional corporations, there is not an operating revenue stream.
   * **Fund Turnover Rate:** The fund turnover rate was 31.10% in 2023, which is on the higher side.

The overall trends in the industry are characterized by large swings in the market, as well as changes in interest rates, and economic conditions. The fund, which is dependent on the performance of global equity markets, is impacted by global events, and macroeconomic pressures.

**Margins:**
Because the fund does not sell or create any product, it doesn't have a 'margin' the same way an operating company would, so it is irrelevant for a company like this.

{: .important } **Competitive Landscape:**

ROHCY operates in the competitive landscape of investment management.
   * **Competitors:** ROHCY competes with a myriad of other investment funds, including both open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds, as well as ETFs.
  * **Performance:** One of the primary ways to attract investment is through consistent, strong performance metrics relative to its benchmark and competitors.
   * **Investment Strategy:** Each manager has their own investment styles. Some investors may focus on growth, or value, or blend between the two.
  * **Costs:** Expense ratios are very important, too.

To differentiate itself from competitors, ROHCY primarily emphasizes long-term value investing in companies with strong fundamentals, which tends to be an unfashionable strategy.

{: .important } **What Makes the Company Different:**

ROHCY's differentiation is found in its focused value investing philosophy and the selection of stocks across global markets, using a "bottom-up" approach.
   * **Value Investing Strategy:** They focus on undervalued securities, which means they have an element of contrarian thinking.
   * **Global Focus:** This provides for a wide range of opportunities that investors in only U.S. markets may not find.
   * **Low Turnover:** The company usually holds stocks for a long period of time to realize long-term potential.

{: .highlight } **Moat Rating: 3 / 5**

ROHCY's moat isn't a traditional, business-oriented one, but a more nuanced, strategy-based one, it derives from its ability to identify and sustain market inefficiencies.
   * **Brand recognition:** They are not a well-recognized company to everyday investors, but among value-oriented investors, they are reputable.
   * **Unique process:** They have a proven track record, including outperforming its peers in the past, showing they have a specialized process.
   * **Intangible asset (strategy):** Their strategy is based on a long-term view and value-orientation, which requires a unique combination of temperament and skill.

Based on these characteristics, the fund is rated a 3, because a moat is something that generates profit over the competitors, but it can be difficult for an investment fund to do that on an ongoing basis. Even with a proven track record, an investment fund can have periods of underperformance. While they have shown they are a good investor, they can't be guaranteed to always have the upper edge.

{: .warning } **Legitimate Risks that Could Harm the Moat:**

Several factors may threaten ROHCY's moat and business resilience:
* **Market Inefficiencies Erode:** As more investors adopt similar value-investing strategies and the market becomes more efficient, it could be harder to source undervalued stocks.
* **Management Turnover:** If the fund managers leave, it could impact investment strategy.
*   **Performance Declines:** Extended periods of underperformance will scare investors away.
*   **Economic Conditions:** A recession, especially one that negatively affects value stocks, would damage its value.

The fund's resilience is anchored by its disciplined value-driven strategy that ensures it focuses on long-term value rather than short-term market hype. While market volatility can affect stock prices, the fund's focus on low price-to-value metrics makes them less susceptible to market swings.

{: .important } **Financials In-Depth:**

Analyzing a financial company like ROHCY requires a different lens than an operating company.
*   **Income Statement:** Since the fund is an investment fund, there is no revenue stream the way an operating company has, instead, there are earnings (i.e. gains from investments) and expenses. For 2023, the total income was $20 million.
    - Net investment income of $15 million (down 19% from prior year)
    - Net realized and unrealized losses of $2.2 million
*   **Balance Sheet:** The fund's balance sheet is primarily composed of securities and is generally healthy.
    - Total assets of $204 million.
    - Total liabilities of $42 million.
    - Total equity of $162 million.
    - Total debt is $523,000
*   **Cash Flow Statement**: In 2023, they had cash flow from operations of +$128 million and from investing of -$92 million.
*   **ROIC:** The ROIC for ROHCY, when measuring from returns of the investment portfolio, is hard to determine because the company does not report return on capital. A reasonable estimation of the return is the total return for 2023, which is around 10% (excluding dividends).
*  **Performance:** Their five-year average total return is 6.8% as of 2024, underperforming its benchmark.
*   **Recent Issues:** One notable event is the underperformance of the fund compared to its peers, and also an ongoing investigation by the SEC, which may result in increased expenses or legal issues. The company is currently working to resolve these issues.

The key takeaway is that ROHCY's financials mirror the portfolio and its returns, the underlying stocks are the major driver of earnings, with liabilities and expenses staying comparatively stable. Also important to monitor for any large changes is how the price of their assets moves over time, as this is very important for future valuation.

{: .important } **Understandability Rating: 2 / 5**

ROHCY receives a understandability rating of 2, because:

* **Simplicity in operation**: The company itself is straightforward to analyze: An investment company that invests in stocks. It does not sell or create a product or provide a service.
   * **Complex Analysis:** However, understanding its valuation requires understanding the underlying investments, how those were chosen, and how those correlate to the underlying markets and economic trends, and then making judgement on these factors.
  *   **Accounting Nuances:** Because the company is a financial firm, accounting and reporting has its own nuances.

{: .important } **Balance Sheet Health: 3 / 5**

ROHCY has a balance sheet health rating of 3.

*   **Low Debt:** The fund has very low debt.
  * **Good Liquidity:** It has a high cash amount.
    * **Asset Volatility:** Its assets are composed of equity securities which have a tendency to fluctuate wildly depending on market conditions.
     *   **Unforeseen Risk:** As stated before, any changes in market structure, macroeconomic conditions, and the potential for management turnover makes it hard for long term predictability.

In conclusion, ROHCY has good fundamentals for a company its type but that it still has moderate exposure to downside risk that must be accounted for.
