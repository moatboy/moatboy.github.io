{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

While BP benefits from some cost advantages stemming from its scale and vertically integrated operations, it operates in a highly cyclical and competitive industry. Its upstream segment is subject to fluctuating commodity prices, and its downstream operations face margin pressure from refining overcapacity. The competitive advantage from scale is not wide enough to be rated higher, given the need to consider BP against a larger set of companies around the world. The recent move toward renewable energy further opens the company up to competition and lowers its overall return on invested capital.

**Management (3/5):**

BP’s management has a mixed record.

* **Positives:** The company has made some shrewd capital allocation decisions in recent years, including its move into renewable energy and its disciplined approach to share buybacks. Management communicates relatively transparently with investors, providing some segment details in its financial reports and addressing strategic trade-offs. The company scores well in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics relative to its peers. (Source: Sustainalytics ESG risk ratings for BP)
* **Negatives:** BP’s historical performance has been inconsistent, with its returns on invested capital often lagging behind its cost of capital. The company’s heavy reliance on acquisitions for growth raises questions about management's ability to create value organically. Recent write-downs of goodwill and impairments highlight the risk of overpaying for acquisitions. Management’s compensation remains high despite this inconsistent performance. The company continues to provide EPS guidance.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Transition to Renewable Energy:** BP’s strategic shift towards renewable energy presents a potential catalyst for multiple expansion, as investors may assign a premium to companies with exposure to this high-growth sector. Success in this transition could lead to a reassessment of BP’s long-term growth prospects. However, the significant upfront investment and competition in the renewable energy industry make this a risky bet.
* **Commodity Prices:** A sustained rise in oil prices could significantly boost BP’s earnings and cash flow, leading to higher returns for shareholders. However, commodity prices are notoriously volatile and difficult to predict. Any price increase may not persist, especially if the world economy continues to slow.
* **Debt Reduction:**  BP is burdened by debt taken to survive earlier crises. Management is aware of this and is actively pursuing debt reduction. This reduces its exposure to rising interest rates and potentially frees up cash flow for buybacks or other shareholder-friendly initiatives. (Source: Q2 2023 earnings call).
* **Share Buybacks:** The company’s ongoing share buyback program could provide a modest boost to its share price. (Source: BP’s 2023 Form 20-F). However, buybacks alone rarely create substantial value unless shares are repurchased at a significant discount.

**Valuation ($130 Billion):**

{: .note }


We used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate BP’s intrinsic value. The most powerful valuation tool for estimating the intrinsic value of a business derives from corporate finance fundamentals and discounted cash flow valuation models. The model forecasts future earnings for the next 10 years and estimates cash flow, taking into account capital expenditure, working capital needs, and after-tax operating income.

{: .warning }


Our forecasts err on the side of prudence. The model normalizes current depressed earnings to a 10 percent pretax operating margin, which is BP's historical average, given the recent earnings drop. Our model assumes growth in oil revenues to be 2% per year with gross domestic product growth and a stable return on invested capital. We assume constant 2023 dollar for the valuations, not including the effects of inflation. We also assume a cost of equity of 9% for BP to compensate for the industry risk, with a 15% probability of failure given its financials and credit rating.

**Key Assumptions:**
* **Growth:** 2% real revenue growth per year (Source: Q2 2023 earnings call)
* **Margin:** 10% pretax margin (Source: BP’s 2023 Form 20-F)
* **Cost of Equity:** 9% (Source: Aswath Damodaran’s 9-10% estimated for the oil and gas industry in 2023)
* **Probability of Failure:** 15% based on the company’s financials and credit rating.
* **Terminal Value:**  A company with a 5% nominal growth rate and a return on capital of 10%.

**Calculation:**
* **Value of Operating Assets:** $110.43 Billion (calculated using discounted cash flow approach over next 10 years)
* **Probability-Weighted Value:** $110.43 Billion *(1 - 0.15) + $30 Billion * 0.15 (Source: Bed Bath & Beyond valuation as a percentage of book value in distress)  = $98.38 Billion
* **Excess Cash:** $30 Billion (Source:  BP’s 2023 Form 20-F)
* **Total Value:** $98.38 Billion + $30 Billion = $128.38 Billion
* **Total Equity Value:**  $128.38 Billion - $27.9 Billion (debt) = $100.48 Billion
* **Value per share** $100.48 Billion / 3.95 billion shares = $25.44 per share. (Source: BP’s 2023 Form 20-F)

**Valuation Conclusion:** 
Based on the company’s current trading price of around $38 per share, the stock looks overvalued.  However, even with a pessimistic outlook, there is considerable upside potential.

**Recent Concerns:**

The recent downturn in global economic activity and its potential effect on commodity prices are a clear and present danger for BP. It also faces regulatory and environmental risks. Management expressed optimism about long-term energy demand, especially in emerging markets, and has taken steps to reduce costs, but the future remains uncertain. There has been some concern that the BP oil spill is damaging its long-term brand image, potentially affecting consumer sentiment and resulting in stricter regulatory restrictions that lower long-term ROI. BP has also been selling assets to lower debt. This might lower short-term ROA due to impairment.

**Closing Comments:**

BP presents a mixed investment opportunity. While the company has some attractive attributes, such as scale and vertical integration, the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry and the uncertainty surrounding its transition to renewable energy make it a relatively risky investment.

Given its current valuation and the company’s recent challenges, an investor would need to have a high degree of confidence in management's ability to execute on its strategy to buy the stock at today’s price.
