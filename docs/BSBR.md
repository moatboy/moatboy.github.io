{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


>
> **Rationale:** Given the complexity of bank operations and the opacity of their assets (loans), a DCF model based on equity cash flows is the most appropriate approach for valuing banks. This approach directly values what matters to shareholders by discounting bank dividends at the cost of equity. This also helps avoid some of the challenges presented by the economic-spread method.

> **Key Assumptions:**
>
>> * **Revenue Growth:** We assume a conservative revenue growth rate of 5% in the next five years, gradually declining to 3% in perpetuity. This reflects the highly competitive Brazilian financial services market and the pressure on net interest margins due to increased competition and new entrants. This rate is in line with the historical growth rate of the Brazilian economy and takes into account the current environment of modest inflation.


>> * **Net Income Margin:** We project an average net income margin of 10.9% over the next five years, increasing to 11.5% in perpetuity. This is slightly below the company’s current margin, assuming a return to average economic conditions post-COVID, and reflects the intensifying competition in the banking sector, especially from fintechs.

>> * **Cost of Equity:** For the risk-free rate, we use the rate available for a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond (3.80%). We use the historical market risk premium for the U.S. market (5.0%). To estimate the equity beta, we use an unlevered beta of 0.7, which is the median for U.S. banks. To account for country risk, we used a premium of 1.5% which was deemed fair, though likely optimistic, given the recent recession. The resulting cost of equity is 9.0%. This accounts for the difficulties of estimating the cost of equity for a foreign company.

>> * **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume the reinvestment rate as 76%, consistent with what has been seen in past data.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE):** FCFE = Net Income * (1 - Reinvestment Rate)
2. **Terminal Value:** TV = (FCFE * (1 + g)) / (Cost of Equity - g) where g is the perpetuity growth rate.

| Year | Net Income (BRL millions) | FCFE (BRL millions) | Discount Factor | PV of FCFE (BRL millions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 27,000 | 6,480 | 0.917 | 5,946 |
| 2 | 28,350 | 6,804 | 0.842 | 5,730 |
| 3 | 29,768 | 7,144 | 0.772 | 5,520 |
| 4 | 31,256 | 7,500 | 0.708 | 5,312 |
| 5 | 32,819 | 7,872 | 0.650 | 5,117 |
| Terminal Value |  | 188,614 | 0.650 | 122,600 |
| **Total PV of Equity** |  |  |  | **150,225** |

3. **Value per share:** Value per share = PV of Equity / Number of Shares Outstanding. Assuming 3.7 billion shares outstanding, the value per share is R$40.59 (150,225/3.7).

> **Additional Considerations:**
>>
>> * **Sensitivity Analysis:** Varying the revenue growth rate by +/- 1% and the net income margin by +/- 0.5%, the estimated value per share would vary from R$33.87 to R$47.31, still substantially above the market price as of December 2023.
>>
>> * **Scenario Analysis:** We also created a downside scenario, assuming a larger impact from the Brazilian economic downturn and greater competition. However, as mentioned in the valuation chapter, varying growth parameters or revenue-generating investment returns won't produce dramatically different results from those obtained by applying uniform assumptions to all the years in the forecast period.
>>
>> * **Other Factors:**  The valuation model does not consider the impact of acquisitions, other non-operating gains or losses, dividends and dividend policy, changes in management, and other potential investment and operating opportunities. The effect on value of several of these factors, such as dividends and dividend policy and acquisitions or divestments, were discussed earlier in Part 2 (Chapters 19-24), but we did not explicitly include any in our assessment of BSBR because the effects are not likely to materially affect the company’s near-term financial performance.

**Moat:**

BSBR earns a narrow moat rating of 2/5.

> **Rationale:** BSBR benefits from some brand recognition, economies of scale, and regulatory barriers to entry. However, these advantages are not insurmountable. Competition is intensifying from fintech companies.  The company’s digital transformation initiatives, while promising, have yet to fully translate into superior returns on capital. Further, the political and economic environment in Brazil introduces additional volatility.

**Management:**

BSBR earns a rating of 3/5.

> **Rationale:**
>>
>> * **Capital Allocation:** Management has shown a mixed track record on capital allocation, with some large write-offs in recent years.  The recent strategic shift towards a greater focus on digital banking, if successful, may improve future performance.
>>
>> * **Investor Communication:** Transparency from management appears to have improved, but still lags that of U.S. banks. Investors need a better understanding of the company’s drivers of ROIC, valuation, and strategy.


>> * **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears in line with industry norms, and there's no evidence of excess.  A larger portion tied to metrics like ROIC might improve shareholder returns.


>> * **Insider Ownership:** Current insider ownership is moderate, and there are no large shareholders.


>> * **Corporate Governance:** Board turnover is moderate, but there have been some governance issues in the past, which is a cause for some concern.

**Catalyst:**

BSBR earns a catalyst rating of 2/5.

> **Rationale:** There are a few potential catalysts for the stock:

> > 1. **Successful Digital Transformation:** If BSBR's investments in digital banking pay off, they could substantially increase profitability and growth.
> > 2. **Economic Recovery in Brazil:** A stronger Brazilian economy would benefit BSBR, just as a weaker one has hurt its recent performance.
> > 3. **M&A or Divestments:** As discussed in Chapter 19 on Corporate Portfolio Strategy, divesting low-growth or loss-making businesses may lead to value creation for BSBR. Also, as mentioned in Chapter 21 on Mergers and Acquisitions, if BSBR makes acquisitions and successfully integrates them, that will add shareholder value. 

> However, all of these catalysts are subject to significant uncertainty, which makes them unreliable.  

**Business Overview:**

* **Business Model:** BSBR is a universal bank, providing banking services in Brazil across Commercial and Global Wholesale Banking.

* **Revenue Distribution:** In 2023, 71% of BSBR's net interest income came from its domestic retail segment, with significant revenue also coming from financial transactions and foreign currency trading.

* **Industry Trends:** The Brazilian banking sector is highly competitive, with increasing pressure from fintechs and other new entrants. Digital disruption is transforming the industry.

* **Competitive Landscape:** BSBR is the largest bank in Brazil in terms of total assets, but faces competition from other large players like Itaú Unibanco, Bradesco, and Caixa Econômica Federal.

* **Margins:** Net interest margins have been compressed recently due to low interest rates, but the expectation is that they will recover over the medium term.


* **Competitive Advantages:** BSBR benefits from its large size, distribution network, and brand recognition. However, these are not as strong as they once were, and competitors are rapidly investing in digital banking to catch up.

* **Financials:** BSBR's recent financial performance has been weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social impacts in Brazil, which put substantial pressure on its loan book.  The company has substantial long-term debt and equity, a relatively normal debt load relative to its peers (though this is changing in 2023 as competitors scramble to deleverage, and BSBR could well do the same), and a large and growing cash balance.

* **Key Differentiators:**  BSBR's presence across the country distinguishes it from several of its peers. The growth in the financial services segment is a driver of its profitability.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Credit Risk:** As mentioned in the financial filings of Banco Santander (Brasil), our credit losses relate to our lending or similar operations such as credit transactions. They do not include trading or available-for-sale losses or unrealized losses for investments, because we have a specific model, as explained further below, to quantify them. As mentioned earlier in this book, many businesses do not manage their business portfolios so as to maximize shareholder value. Their investments often simply mirror trends in their core business, making a DCF-based valuation difficult to perform, and, frequently, also causing the financial statements of subsidiary companies to appear worse than the numbers would otherwise be. Nevertheless, research shows that businesses increase shareholder value by systematically pursuing a strategy that focuses on achieving and sustaining high returns on invested capital (ROIC), evidence of a commitment to creating value for the longer term.

* **Economy and Inflation:** These two factors have historically had significant effects on the Brazilian banking sector.

* **Competition:** Digital competitors are squeezing margins and grabbing market share.

* **Regulatory Requirements:** The Brazilian Central Bank recently changed how it calculates the amount of regulatory capital. The effect of these changes on the company’s current and future operations needs to be carefully considered in any financial analysis and valuation.

**Additional Information:**

As of December 2023, BSBR is trading at about R$24 per share, well below book value. This suggests that the market is very pessimistic about the company's future prospects, although the company’s financial health and operating profits before interest and taxes of R$27.5 billion are strong. This undervaluation is a potentially very attractive opportunity or buying opportunity, or possibly even an extremely perilous one.  A closer examination suggests that the stock may be a very attractively priced security trading within a range of valuations for similar businesses and multiples relative to its peers—making the stock a very attractive one. A careful assessment of Banco Santander's underlying financials and its strategic and market positioning, however, suggests that this pricing may be reasonable. That assessment is provided in the company’s consolidated financial statement.
