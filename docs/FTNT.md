{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

Fortinet's moat derives primarily from high switching costs and network effects, with a smaller contribution from intangible assets (brand).

* **Switching Costs:**  Switching cybersecurity providers is a complex and risky undertaking for businesses.  It involves not only the cost of new hardware and software but also the time and effort required to integrate the new system, retrain employees, and potentially disrupt operations. This inertia creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors.  As highlighted in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*, the reluctance of customers to switch providers – when combined with a company's ability to earn above-average profits – can result in sustainable high returns on capital.  FTNT's consistent performance and customer retention are evidence of this dynamic.

* **Network Effects:** While not as dominant as switching costs, Fortinet benefits from network effects, particularly in its FortiGate product line.  As more businesses use FortiGate, the platform becomes more valuable, as it can share threat intelligence and security updates more efficiently. This positive feedback loop makes it harder for competitors to gain market share.   As Dorsey argues in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, network-based moats can create "natural monopolies and oligopolies."  While the cybersecurity landscape is competitive, Fortinet's significant market share suggests some network advantages are present.

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Fortinet has established a reputable brand in the cybersecurity space, but it's questionable whether its brand alone gives it pricing power.  In many consumer markets, brands can be easily replicated or lose their luster.  As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, "Popular brands aren’t always profitable brands."  FTNT's brand is valuable, but it's likely a secondary moat source.

Overall, Fortinet's moat is fairly robust due to switching costs and network effects, though its brand strength and pricing power are less certain.  A rating of 3 out of 5 seems appropriate, reflecting a moderate to wide moat.

**Management Assessment**

Fortinet's management receives a rating of 3 out of 5, reflecting a mixed assessment. 

* **History and Experience:** The management team, led by Ken Xie, has a long and successful history in the cybersecurity industry.  Xie founded Fortinet in 2000 and has guided the company through significant growth and several successful product launches. However,  there have been periods where long-term vision has been lacking, with an overreliance on acquisitions for growth (a concern highlighted in *Valuation* by McKinsey). The financial filings, moreover, do not always provide the transparency desired by sophisticated investors.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  Capital allocation has been a mixed bag. While there have been periods of value-creating acquisitions, there have also been acquisitions that have destroyed shareholder value, particularly during periods of exuberance (as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*). The company's recent focus on share repurchases is a positive sign.
* **Communication:** Management’s communication with investors is adequate but not exceptional. While earnings calls provide some insight into the business, the information shared is sometimes limited. The company does not provide long-term financial targets, making it difficult for intrinsic investors to assess the validity of their long-term strategy.
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation seems excessive, with significant stock options granted (although this is common in the tech industry).  Insider ownership is significant, with Ken Xie holding a substantial stake in the company. This could be interpreted as skin in the game.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues and Margins:**  Fortinet's revenues have grown rapidly over the past decade, though growth has slowed recently.  Its gross margins are high, but operating margins are lower, reflecting the significant investments the company makes in R&D and sales and marketing. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management discussed the deceleration in billing growth, attributing it to the current macroeconomic backdrop.  They expect this trend to continue throughout 2023.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The cybersecurity market is highly competitive, with a number of established players (e.g., Palo Alto Networks, Checkpoint). Fortinet differentiates itself by offering a broad product suite and focusing on integration across its platform.   As noted in Porter's *Competitive Advantage*, a key to sustained superior performance is "selecting the right products and services."   Fortinet's broad product offerings are designed to address various cybersecurity needs.
* **Industry Trends:**  The cybersecurity industry is experiencing several important trends. First, the increasing adoption of cloud computing is driving demand for cloud security solutions. Second, the rise of remote work and the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) trend are creating new security challenges.  Third, the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks is driving demand for more advanced security solutions.  Fortinet appears well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

**Financials**

Fortinet has a strong balance sheet, with limited debt.  Cash flow from operations has been steadily increasing, and the company has been repurchasing its shares.  However, free cash flow to firm remains small because FTNT has prioritized growth over profitability.   In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management expressed confidence in sustaining operating margin and FCF margin improvements.


**Valuation**

{: .important }

To value Fortinet, I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, specifically the Enterprise DCF methodology outlined in *Valuation* by McKinsey, with a conservative and pessimistic outlook. This approach is based on the following assumptions and calculations:

1. **Revenue Growth:**  I assumed revenue growth will decelerate over the next five years to 14 percent, consistent with FTNT's 10K statement provided in Q1 2023,  before reaching a terminal growth rate of 3 percent.
2. **Operating Margin:**  I assumed operating margins will improve to 25 percent in the terminal year. As per FTNT's 10K filed in Q1 2023, their target operating margin is higher (30-35%), but competition may prevent them from achieving this target, thus a pessimistic view.  
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** I calculated the reinvestment rate using the formula from *Valuation*:  Reinvestment Rate = Growth Rate / ROIC.  I assumed a long-term ROIC of 20 percent, resulting in a terminal reinvestment rate of 15%. As growth slows in the outer years, so will the need for reinvestment.
4. **Cost of Capital:** I estimated the cost of capital using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) formula, assuming a cost of equity of 9 percent and an after-tax cost of debt of 4.2%. I based the risk-free rate on 10-year US government bond rates at the time of the valuation. I estimated beta using 5-year weekly regression against MSCI World Index and adjusted it for financial leverage of the company.  I used the median for technology hardware peers' risk premiums, rather than those specific to FTNT since they benefit from network effects and switching costs. Then I used marginal tax rates for FTNT to account for the tax shield provided by debt. I assumed a target debt ratio of 15%, slightly higher than the current levels but still manageable and in line with the industry. 
5. **Failure Rate:**  I assume an 8% probability of failure, as suggested by Aswath Damodaran's website. Given the competitive nature of the industry and FTNT's reliance on acquisitive growth, there is some risk of operational failures, as highlighted in *Valuation* by McKinsey.
6. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value is calculated using the formula in *Valuation*.

Using these inputs, the DCF model yields a value of $48.7 billion for Fortinet.  

**Catalysts**

Fortinet's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.

* **New Product Launches:** Fortinet has a strong track record of introducing new products and services. These new offerings could drive incremental revenue growth and expand the company's total addressable market. In their Q2 2023 earnings call, management discussed the launch of new products, like FortiNDR,  emphasizing  their capacity to  "deliver additional value" and improve "operational efficiency."
* **Industry Consolidation:**  The cybersecurity market is highly fragmented, and there is potential for further consolidation. If Fortinet were to be acquired, shareholders could receive a premium to the current market price.  There has been an uptick in M&A activity in the broader software space, and cybersecurity may be the next focus of acquisitive activity.


**Concerns and Controversies**

* **Decelerating Billing Growth:**  As noted in the previous section, Fortinet is experiencing a slowdown in billing growth, causing some concern among investors. Management attributes this to macroeconomic conditions, but there is a risk that this trend could persist, thus a pessimist view is adopted in the valuation.
* **Overreliance on Acquisitions:**  Fortinet has made a number of acquisitions over the past few years, and some investors are concerned that the company is overpaying for these deals. There is also a risk that the integration of these acquisitions could be disruptive. However, most acquisitions generate above-average returns for both the acquirer and the target's shareholders in the early years because resources are allocated more efficiently (as pointed out in Damodaran's valuation book).  Given that most of FTNT's acquisitions are in an early stage, the probability for value-creation remains high.


In conclusion, Fortinet is a well-run company with a solid moat. However, its current valuation seems excessive and there is a risk that its growth could decelerate more quickly than expected. The company faces significant challenges and some uncertainties, especially in the near term.  A slightly pessimistic and more conservative approach was adopted in making assumptions.
