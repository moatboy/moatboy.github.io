EQR's moat stems primarily from its focus on owning apartment buildings in coastal gateway cities in the United States. These cities generally have high barriers to entry due to zoning regulations and a NIMBY ("not in my backyard") attitude, creating a localized oligopoly, which gives incumbents some pricing power. {: .highlight } However, this moat is narrow because apartments are not particularly differentiated products, and brand loyalty or switching costs are minimal. Any new development, though difficult, will eventually increase supply and put pressure on occupancy rates, thus limiting long-term pricing power.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


> Management's discussion of supply and demand conditions confirms this assessment. In its Q2 2023 earnings call, the company discussed how new supply coming to the market is impacting rental rates, with a 2.1% increase in same-store revenue growth year over year, relative to the 4.5% growth from 2021 to 2022. However, the current management team seems to be better positioning itself to maintain high occupancy rates amidst this increasing supply by enhancing its use of data and analytics, as mentioned in the Q3 2022 earnings call. Management’s goal is to “anticipate what people will do, what they will want.” With this in mind, EQR is developing a digital platform to enable a more personalized approach to resident engagement.

**Management Assessment:** EQR's management receives a 3 out of 5 rating. 

* **Positives:** The company has a long and stable history, having been in business for decades. Management is focused on long-term value creation. The team has a good track record of navigating challenging market conditions. The compensation structure at EQR encourages long-term value creation by tying compensation to the company’s long-term performance against peers.
* **Concerns:** The business is very capital intensive. The amount of inside ownership is not particularly impressive (less than 1%), which indicates that management does not have as much skin in the game as they could. Management often speaks about acquisitions and share repurchases without providing a clear indication of how such actions contribute to value creation. Its communication often overemphasizes earnings without providing enough information about returns on invested capital, its key driver of value creation.

**Catalysts:** EQR has a catalyst rating of 2 out of 5. While its core markets are likely to remain attractive in the long run, there are no significant near-term catalysts that are likely to significantly increase share price. The following could improve the company’s market valuation:

* **Continuing economic recovery:** A strong economic recovery would increase rental income and demand, thereby leading to more rapid growth rates and improved margins, though the emergence of remote work may temper this catalyst somewhat.
* **Improved investor communication:** Management could improve investor relations by more clearly communicating its long-term plans for value creation. This would require disclosing more data on returns on invested capital and less emphasis on quarterly earnings per share.  
* **Reduced new supply:** A decrease in the supply of new apartment buildings in EQR’s markets would reduce competition and support occupancy rates and pricing.

**Valuation:**

{: .important }
EQR is valued using a discounted cash flow model with the following business-as-usual assumptions.

**Assumptions**
* **Forecast period:** 10 years (2024-2033)
* **Terminal period:** Forever
* **Revenue growth:** We assume revenue will grow at an average annual rate of 3.4% through the end of the forecast period, which is consistent with the consensus long-term economic growth rate. Then, in the continuing-value period, we assume revenues growth will fall to 3% annually, in line with long-run inflation.
* **Margins:** We assume that EQR’s operating margin (EBIT/Revenue) will remain stable at 35% over the forecast period, and that it will drop to the industry median level of 30% thereafter. This is a bit pessimistic given that EQR has been earning well-above industry-median margins and because the company seems to be implementing new strategies to maintain its occupancy rates.
* **Reinvestment rate:** We start by assuming that the company will need to invest 24% of after-tax operating income back into the business to achieve 3.4% revenue growth (reinvestment rate = growth/ROIC). With the given assumptions concerning EQR’s cost of capital, this would mean that the company’s ROIC would be about 14%. We make the rather pessimistic assumption that management is unable to improve this ROIC. We assume a cost of capital of 8.8%. Given this revenue growth and margin assumptions, we arrive at an EBIT in year 10 (2033) of $3.9 billion.
* **Tax rate:** 25%

**Calculations**
1. **Continuing value (CV):**
CV = (NOPLAT<sub>11</sub> (1 - Reinvestment rate)) / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate)
CV = ($3.9B * (1 - 0.08)) / (0.088 - 0.03)
CV = $67.8B


2. **Present value of cash flows:** We discount the cash flows at EQR’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to arrive at a present value of $22.4 billion. Note that the discount factors given in the present value calculation in chapter 6 of Damodaran’s *Little Book of Valuation* may not be accurate.

3. **Enterprise value:**
EV = PV(FCF) + CV
EV = $22.4B + $67.8B
EV = $90.2B

4. **Equity value:** We subtract debt and add cash and cash equivalents from the enterprise value. From EQR’s Q3 2023 financial statement, we have the following:

Debt = $15.6B
Cash = $0.9B
Debt Net of Cash = $14.7B

Therefore, EQR’s equity value is:
Equity = Enterprise Value - Debt
Equity = $90.2B - $14.7B
Equity = $75.5B

5. **Fair Value per Share:**
No. of Shares Outstanding = 400 million
Fair value per share = $75.5B/ 400 million = $188.75

> Since management does not actively manage earnings, as demonstrated by a fairly volatile distribution of earnings per share for the company,
