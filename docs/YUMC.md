{: .warning }
**Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience:**

  *   **Intense Competition:** A major risk factor is the extreme competition in China. Local QSR chains, fast-food restaurants, and street vendors are competitors. Also, there are various food delivery apps that have penetrated and disrupted the market with lower prices. YUMC has to constantly innovate, improve its operations, and offer a good experience in order to stay relevant.
  *   **Economic Fluctuations:**  The company’s operations are subject to fluctuations in China’s overall economy, including inflation, shifts in consumer spending, and changes in the job markets.
  *   **Changes in Consumer Preferences:** YUMC needs to be aware of changing tastes and adapt to remain relevant. Consumer preferences are prone to change quickly and if the company fails to keep up, it could harm the earnings and value.
  *   **Food Safety Issues**: In the past, there have been several food safety related issues in China, and this puts YUMC at risk if it is caught in such a scenario. Any major food scandal could damage their credibility and put the business at risk.

    *   For example, in the past Chinese government’s policy restricting online gaming have created a negative impact on companies in the digital industry.

  *   While the core business concept of YUMC – quick service restaurants – is relatively easy to grasp, there are several factors that add complexity to understanding its operation including its complex financials and the impact of Chinese government policies on the company's results.
  *   Moreover, the structure of YUMC, with its numerous brands and operations across China, requires a solid knowledge base for the investor to fully understand.
  *   In addition, different levels of reporting on the different business units make the valuation of the business hard, as YUMC's revenue is derived from a variety of its brands each with different geographies. The impact of acquisitions and changes in business is hard to model and understand.
