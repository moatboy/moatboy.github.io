>The moat, understandability, and balance sheet health scores reflect a conservative evaluation to ensure a margin of safety in any assessment.



{: .highlight }
OSI Systems operates through three segments: Security, Healthcare, and Optoelectronics and Manufacturing.
The Security division, which generates a majority of the revenue, provides security screening solutions, including x-ray, explosives, and trace-detection systems, and its services span across airports, seaports, and other areas. The Healthcare division creates medical devices for patient monitoring, cardiology, anesthesia, and point-of-care testing. Optoelectronics and Manufacturing includes designing, manufacturing, and selling specialized optoelectronic devices.

*   **Revenue Distribution:** The Security division has been the main driver of revenue for OSIS. While the geographical breakdown isn't always clear, the majority of revenues are derived from the USA, but there are growing revenues from international markets.
*   **Industry Trends:** The security industry is facing a growing market, driven by increasing demand for safety and security screening. Companies must compete by offering better, faster, and more reliable products while maintaining and lowering costs. The healthcare market is also growing with demand for better and more technologically advanced equipment. There is high research and development and high regulatory compliance.
*    **Margins:** OSIS, in general, has had a steady operating margin of around 9%, but due to current macro economical headwinds, the operating margin has decreased in recent quarters. Gross margin was between 30-40% consistently, but these figures have recently shown a small drop.
*    **Competitive Landscape:** OSI Systems faces a moderately competitive landscape. In the security sector, it competes with companies like Smiths Detection, L3Harris Technologies, and Analogic Corporation. The competition is fierce, and a big moat is needed to maintain above average profitabilities. In the Healthcare segment, it competes with larger companies like Medtronic and GE Healthcare. In the Optoelectronics and Manufacturing, it competes with smaller and larger players in specialized optics markets. In every field the competition is fierce.
*   **What Makes OSI Systems Different:** OSI Systems leverages a broad range of technologies in its specialized niche markets. The ability to create diverse products across different divisions makes the company a better competitor. It has a good relationship with government agencies which help sales. There is a focus on research and development that allows for continued innovation.
*  **Financials:** Analyzing the consolidated statements, OSIS has maintained consistent growth in revenues and net income over the past several years. The company has a decent operating income of about 9-10% over most periods. The management is trying to increase ROIC by improving operational efficiencies. The balance sheet is pretty complex and requires careful analysis, with high working capital and reliance on debt for financing operations.
    *   **Income Statement:** Revenues show a consistent increase year over year, with the security division being the largest contributor to the revenues. The expenses have been increasing steadily, mostly due to the cost of the goods sold and operating expenses. Recently the operating expenses have climbed substantially, lowering margins. R&D spend is fairly low, but is expected to be increasing. There are some non recurring items. Income from continuing operations has stayed somewhat the same.
     *   **Balance Sheet:** The company has a lot of inventory, a substantial amount of other current assets, and a good amount of total assets. It also carries a lot of debt, which has increased considerably over the years, and also has an average level of current liabilities and long-term liabilities. The shareholders’ equity has also stayed relatively low. The amount of cash and cash equivalents has been decreasing substantially.
     *   **Cash Flow Statement:** Cash flow from operations is positive and in the recent years has been increasing substantially, but cash flow from investments is heavily negative, which leads to total negative free cash flows. This is offset somewhat by cash flow from financing.
    *  **Recent Concerns/Controversies/Problems Faced:** There were some accounting issues in 2023 that saw the share price fall considerably. The company has also been criticized for its large stock-based compensation and high debt levels. Supply chain issues have been a persistent problem. Moreover, there is intense competition in all of its markets, and the company has to balance its long-term vision with current profit goals. However, the management is taking steps to increase profitability, improve the balance sheet health, and cut costs, according to recent earnings calls.

**Moat Analysis (3 / 5):** OSIS has certain advantages that protect it from competition, but these are not very strong or durable. The company benefits from its established relationships with government agencies and customers. Also, the proprietary technology and large breadth of products across multiple segments provide it a certain advantage. However, due to high competition across its markets, these competitive advantages may not be long lasting. The industry also has fairly low barriers of entry. The company’s ROIC has also trended lower which further shows that it does not have a strong moat. Hence, a score of 3/5 is appropriate. The best parts of the moats are its scale in the security business and its innovation.

  **Legitimate Risks To The Moat:** Technological disruption, regulatory shifts, especially in government contracts, and new competitors who are able to create similar products and services at a lower price could affect OSI Systems. Moreover, any major incident related to its business, could also have a significant impact to the company’s reputation. Moreover, the company is also subject to global economic factors that may affect its markets. Supply chain issues could cause revenue loss and operational inefficiencies.
 *   **Business Resilience:** The business is somewhat resilient due to its wide range of products and diversified customer base, with recurring revenues, but it is still susceptible to market shifts and technological developments. The company has been performing well in the last few years, showcasing its adaptability and resilience to a certain extent.

{: .important }
**Understandability Rating (2 / 5):** Due to the complex nature of financial statements, the wide range of products it produces, and complex calculations related to the business, it is a fairly complicated company to analyse and understand. Most of the information to value a company is not present in one simple place. There is a strong element of "reading between the lines" to try and decipher what is going on with the company's underlying business. Hence, a rating of 2 out of 5 is suitable.

{: .important }
**Balance Sheet Health Rating (3 / 5):** The balance sheet is moderately healthy. The company carries a lot of debt which makes the company vulnerable to high interest rates and has seen high levels of debt in the past. It is also slowly dwindling its cash and cash equivalents. There have been increases in current assets over the past few years, but there have also been increases in liabilities. Also, the shareholder equity is relatively low. There are also some unusual accounting procedures for asset capitalization and amortization, which may make financial results hard to interpret. Due to the mix of positive and negative points, the balance sheet health deserves a rating of 3 out of 5.
