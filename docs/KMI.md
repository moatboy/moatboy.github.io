{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

Kinder Morgan's moat stems primarily from its ownership of hard-to-replicate assets. Pipelines, terminals, and storage facilities require significant upfront investment and regulatory approval, creating substantial barriers to entry. This is particularly true for natural gas pipelines, where KMI has a dominant position. However, the moat is not without its weaknesses.

* **Regulation:** While regulation provides a barrier to entry, it also limits pricing power and profitability. Recent regulatory changes in the energy sector may also introduce new uncertainties, impacting future cash flows. This is discussed in more detail in the company's 2021 annual report and Q2 2023 earnings call, where management expressed uncertainty about pending FERC regulation of natural gas pipelines. 
* **Competition:** While KMI is a giant, it faces competition from other large, well-capitalized energy infrastructure companies, such as Enbridge and Enterprise Products Partners. This limits KMI’s ability to extract economic profits.
* **Commodity Dependence:** KMI’s fortunes are tied to commodity prices, particularly natural gas. This introduces volatility into its earnings and makes long-term forecasting more difficult. As noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call, the company's natural gas segment performance was directly tied to changes in natural gas commodity prices.

Overall, Kinder Morgan's moat is rated a 3/5.  Its asset base provides a solid foundation, but regulatory constraints and commodity price volatility limit its defensive strength.

**Management Analysis**

Kinder Morgan’s management team, led by CEO Steve Kean and CFO David Michels, has a long history in the energy sector. They are generally regarded as competent operators, though not without their critics.

* **Capital Allocation:** Management has historically prioritized dividends and share repurchases, though sometimes to the detriment of reinvestment and growth. This has improved somewhat in recent years with management emphasizing capital investments, as evidenced by Kinder Morgan's 2021 Form 10-K and 2022 Form 10-K, which detailed increased capital expenditures relative to previous years.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance, though a large portion is stock-based, which can misalign incentives, as discussed in _The Essays of Warren Buffett_.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, reducing management’s commitment to long-term shareholder value creation. This is evidenced in the company's 2021 proxy statement, which shows relatively low levels of insider ownership compared to those of senior executives at Berkshire Hathaway and other owner-operated businesses.
* **Communication:** Investor relations have been criticized for a lack of transparency, particularly in breaking down profitability drivers by segment. 

Overall, Kinder Morgan’s management is rated a 3/5.  They are capable operators, but their capital allocation decisions and communication with investors have room for improvement.


**Catalyst Analysis**

Kinder Morgan’s share price could benefit from several potential catalysts:

* **Increased Energy Demand:** A sustained rise in energy demand, particularly for natural gas, would benefit KMI’s pipeline business. As noted in the Q4 2022 earnings call, management is "bullish" on long-term global demand for natural gas.
* **Infrastructure Spending:**  Increased government spending on energy infrastructure could create new opportunities for KMI.
* **Divestiture of Noncore Assets:**  Selling noncore assets could free up capital for higher-return investments or share repurchases, boosting shareholder value.


Overall, Kinder Morgan’s catalyst rating is 2/5. The catalysts are realistic, but their impact on the share price is unlikely to be transformative.

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was performed using the company’s 2020, 2021 and 2022 financials. A 10-year forecast was created, breaking it down into two parts: a 5-year explicit forecast where individual line items were projected and a 5-year continuing value forecast assuming steady growth. A pessimistic outlook was adopted, given current market conditions and the uncertainty of long-term energy demand and natural gas prices, reflecting a concern emphasized in _The Little Book of Valuation_.

**Key Assumptions (all in U.S. dollar amounts):**

* **Revenue Growth:** Average 2% annual revenue growth over 10 years. 
* **Operating Margin:** Gradual improvement, reaching 15% by year 10. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% in stable growth.
* **Cost of Capital:** 7.56%. This is based on a target capital structure of 14% debt and 86% equity, a cost of debt of 4.27%, a cost of equity of 9.00%, and a 25% tax rate. The target capital structure is based on the median debt ratio of comparable companies in the chemicals industry in 2023. The cost of debt is based on a BBB rating assigned by rating agencies. The cost of equity is derived using the CAPM, with a risk-free rate of 3.25%, a beta of 0.75, and a market risk premium of 4.50%.
* **Failure Rate:** 10% chance of failure reflecting the uncertainty around the long-term demand for fossil fuels.  Liquidation value is estimated at one-quarter of book value (in the event of failure).

**Calculations:**


1. **Project financials for explicit years (Years 1–5):**  Forecast revenues, operating income, reinvestment, and free cash flow. All figures are detailed in the excel workbook provided, but the key driver formulas used were revenue = (prior year revenue) * (1 + revenue growth rate), reinvestment rate = (change in sales)/(change in after-tax operating income), FCFF = EBIT (1- tax rate) * (1 - reinvestment rate).


2. **Estimate continuing value:** After-tax operating income in year 6 * (1 - reinvestment rate) / (cost of capital - growth rate). For our valuation of KMI, this equals $49,316 Million. This assumes terminal growth of 1%, and assumes that the company will have a 26.67% reinvestment rate in the continuing value years.


3. **Discount cash flows:** Discount free cash flow each year at the cost of capital and discount the terminal value back to present.


4. **Calculate enterprise value:** Sum of present values of free cash flows and terminal value. The resulting Enterprise value of KMI is $60,112 Million.


5. **Calculate equity value:**  Enterprise value + cash + value of minority interests - value of debt - value of preferred shares - other non-equity claims. This resulted in an equity value of $46,316 Million


6. **Calculate value per share:** Equity value / number of diluted shares outstanding. Using 2,110 Million diluted shares, the resulting per share value is $21.95.


7. **Estimate market value:** The latest recorded market capitalization for KMI is $44,538 million (as of December 31, 2022).


8. **Incorporate the probability of failure:**  Value = (Value in Business as Usual Scenario)*(1- Probability of Failure) + (Value in Failure Scenario)*(Probability of Failure). In our valuation, incorporating the probability of failure results in a market value of $47.4 Billion (rounded).

{: .note }

This valuation was based upon numerous subjective assumptions that are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and company performance. Furthermore, the valuation does not explicitly incorporate many of the factors that affect KMI's intrinsic and market value, such as the complexity of the pipeline and energy industry dynamics and the company's expansion into new lines of business or new geographic regions. For these reasons, use an average of a discounted cash flow valuation, a comparable company analysis, and a precedent transaction analysis.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

Kinder Morgan faced scrutiny in 2022 for its handling of a pipeline spill in Texas. The company responded by increasing its capital expenditures on pipeline safety and integrity.  In addition, as mentioned earlier, pending FERC regulatory actions concerning natural gas pipeline rates continue to be a source of uncertainty.

**Overall Assessment**

Kinder Morgan is a large, stable company with a solid asset base and visible cash flows. However, its heavy exposure to natural gas prices, the uncertainty surrounding new FERC regulatory policies, and a mixed track record on capital allocation require a margin of safety. At its current price of around \$17 per share (as of early 2023), the stock appears fairly valued, but with limited upside. 

Therefore, a rating of **Hold** is warranted. It is not the worst company to hold, but the rewards hardly outweigh the risks.
