Pessimistic value: €70 billion

BMW, a renowned luxury car manufacturer, possesses some characteristics of a moat, but its strength and durability are questionable.  The brand carries prestige and some pricing power, but intense competition and shifting consumer preferences (towards electric vehicles) put downward pressure on long-term profitability.

**Moat (2/5): Narrow**

BMW's brand is undoubtedly valuable, conferring a degree of pricing power and inspiring customer loyalty. However, unlike true luxury goods like Hermes or Tiffany,  differentiation based on quality or features is not substantial enough to create a wide moat.  Competitors like Mercedes-Benz and Audi offer comparable products, limiting BMW's ability to significantly raise prices without losing market share.  Furthermore, the rise of electric vehicles, where Tesla has gained a first-mover advantage and legacy automakers are rapidly trying to catch up, threatens the competitive positioning of traditional luxury car manufacturers.

**Management (2/5): Fair**

While BMW has navigated past economic cycles and maintained profitability, its recent capital allocation decisions have been questionable. The push into electric vehicles has been relatively late and arguably insufficiently aggressive, potentially allowing competitors to gain a stronger foothold in this growing segment.  Moreover, the management's communication regarding their long-term vision and strategy for navigating this industry transition seems to lack some of the transparency and detail that would reassure a value-conscious investor.  For instance, while their Q2 2023 earnings call discussed EV targets and development, the specifics of their moat strategy within the EV space were rather vague.  Insider ownership appears to be modest, which could raise concerns about alignment with shareholder interests. Compensation appears to be in line with industry peers, offering neither a strong positive nor negative signal.

**Catalyst (2/5): Moderate**

The shift to electric vehicles could present a catalyst for BMW if the company successfully transitions its product offerings and manages to capture market share within the luxury EV segment.  However, this is far from a certain outcome given the intense competition and the current dominance of Tesla. Another potential catalyst could stem from improvements in their production and supply chain efficiencies, as highlighted in the Q2 2023 earnings call. However, these efforts will likely only incrementally benefit margins, given the competitive industry landscape.

**Business Overview:**

BMW operates primarily in the premium automotive space, with its core business focused on selling luxury cars under the BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce brands.  It also has a motorcycle segment and offers financial services.

* **Revenue Distribution:** Primarily driven by automotive sales, followed by financial services and motorcycles.  Geographic distribution is global, with a significant portion of revenue derived from China, the U.S. and Europe.
* **Industry Trends:**  The automotive industry is in a period of rapid transformation, primarily driven by the shift to electric vehicles.  This represents both a challenge and an opportunity for BMW.  Technological innovations like autonomous driving and connected car features are also transforming the competitive landscape.
* **Margins:** BMW historically has enjoyed relatively high margins relative to mass-market auto manufacturers.  However, intense competition, higher R&D expenses related to EV development, and rising raw material costs are putting downward pressure on margins.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The luxury car market is fiercely competitive, with BMW facing strong rivals like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Lexus.  In the EV space, Tesla is the current dominant player, and legacy automakers are rapidly developing competing models.
* **Differentiating Factors:**  BMW has traditionally differentiated itself through its brand reputation, performance engineering, and styling. However, as noted earlier, these advantages are eroding as competitors catch up in terms of technology and performance, particularly within the electric vehicle space.


**Financial Analysis:**

Analyzing BMW's financials from 2020 to 2022 reveals declining margins and a return on invested capital that is only modestly above the cost of capital.

* **Revenues:** Have been relatively flat, reflecting a mature and competitive industry impacted by economic cycles and supply chain disruptions.
* **Margins:** EBIT margins have been declining, driven by pricing pressure, higher input costs, and increased investments in R&D.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** While ROIC is declining, it remains modestly above the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which could potentially indicate the existence of a narrow moat.  However, the declining trend should cause concern.  (See table below)
* **Capital Allocation:**  Investment in R&D has been substantial, but the success of BMW’s EV transition will ultimately determine whether these investments generate above-average returns.  Given the competitive industry landscape and the dominance of Tesla in the EV market, I am somewhat pessimistic in my outlook.
* **Capital Structure:**  BMW maintains an investment-grade rating and a reasonable debt level.


| Year | Revenues (€ Millions) | Operating Margin (%) | ROIC (%) | WACC (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2020 | 98,990 | 2.4 | 8 | 4 |
| 2021 | 111,239 | 10.3 | 16 | 4 |
| 2022 | 128,681 | 7.2 | 14 | 4 |

**Valuation (€70 billion):**


A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, using the figures from the years 2020-2022 and making some reasonable assumptions, reveals the current price is above the intrinsic value of the company. For the purposes of calculating ROIC, revenues were inflated from nominal to real values using a general inflation rate of 2%.

<callout>

**Key Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% per year (below the long-term historical GDP growth rate)
* **Operating Margin:** Remains flat at 7.2% (reflecting persistent pricing pressure)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40%  (in line with historical)
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (slightly higher than historical to reflect the increased risk)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2% (in line with long-term nominal growth assumptions)


</callout>


**Calculations:**

1. **Project free cash flow (FCF) for the next 10 years**, using the assumed revenue growth, operating margin, and reinvestment rate.  
2. **Calculate the terminal value**, using the terminal growth rate and the cost of capital.
3. **Discount the projected FCF and the terminal value** back to the present, using the cost of capital.
4. **Sum the present values** to arrive at the enterprise value.
5. **Subtract net debt and minority interests** (if any) from the enterprise value to arrive at the equity value.
6. **Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding** to get the fair value per share.

Performing these calculations with the above assumptions yields a valuation of roughly €70 billion for BMWKY. This is an approximation and does not account for potential complexities related to specific ownership structure, currency translation and etc.

**Conclusion:**

BMW’s brand and modest ROIC constitute a narrow moat, but its ability to maintain this competitive advantage and sustain profitability is debatable in light of industry trends and competitive pressures.  Given the lackluster financial performance in recent years, the late entry into the EV market, and a somewhat opaque long-term vision, management’s ability to successfully navigate this crucial industry transition is far from assured.  Based on a DCF valuation with somewhat pessimistic assumptions, the current share price appears to be expensive.
