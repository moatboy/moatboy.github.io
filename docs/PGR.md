{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** P&G operates globally, with a fairly balanced geographical footprint. North America typically contributes the largest share of revenue, followed by other developed markets and emerging markets. Its product portfolio spans a broad range of categories, including beauty, grooming, health care, fabric & home care, and baby, feminine & family care.  No single product or category represents an excessive concentration.
* **Industry Trends:** The consumer staples industry is generally considered a slow-growth industry. P&G’s overall revenue growth has been generally in the low single digits, in line with broader industry trends. Emerging market growth has been a bright spot in recent years. However, these markets are also typically more volatile and competitive.
* **Margins:** P&G has historically enjoyed relatively high operating margins, well above the industry median. This stems from the pricing power conferred by its strong brands, combined with efficient manufacturing and distribution operations.  {: .highlight} However, margin expansion can be challenging in a competitive environment, and input cost inflation can exert significant pressure at times. {: .highlight }  P&G's margins have come down slightly in the last 3 years.

**Moat Analysis:**

P&G’s core moat stems from the power of its brands.  {: .important } Consumers are willing to pay a premium for brands they trust and that have earned a reputation for quality and performance.  This brand loyalty creates a buffer against competitors and provides pricing power. Examples include Tide, Gillette, Pampers, Crest, and many others. This translates into consistent and robust profits and high returns on invested capital. {: .important }

Economies of scale, particularly in distribution, further bolster P&G’s competitive position.  Its massive size allows it to negotiate favorable terms with retailers and efficiently distribute its products worldwide. This scale is a significant barrier to entry for new competitors and makes it very difficult for smaller firms to compete effectively.

While the consumer staples sector isn't immune to competitive pressures and changing consumer preferences, P&G’s wide moat and diversified portfolio of leading brands make it well-positioned to sustain its competitive advantages and generate excess returns over the long term.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

A moat rating of 4 out of 5 reflects P&G's strong but not impenetrable competitive advantages. While its brands and scale provide a powerful defense, they are not invulnerable.  {: .warning } Private-label competition, changing consumer tastes, and the rise of new distribution channels (e.g., e-commerce) pose ongoing challenges. {: .warning }  A more pessimistic outlook on the long-term durability of its brands and the potential for margin erosion in an increasingly competitive environment justifies a slightly lower rating than a perfect 5.


**Valuation:**

To estimate a fair value for P&G, we will use a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model. We will focus on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), which aligns with the principles laid out in the provided books, specifically *Valuation* by McKinsey. Given the recent uncertainty in the market and rising interest rates, a more pessimistic outlook will be adopted for the valuation.

**Key Assumptions:**

1. **Revenue Growth:**  2% annual growth for the next five years (reflecting a pessimistic view of developed market growth), followed by 1% terminal growth in perpetuity (below inflation).
2. **Operating Margin:** Gradually increasing from current level (14%) to 15% over the next 10 years, then gradually declining to 14.5% in perpetuity, reflecting a conservative and pessimistic outlook for margin sustainability.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** Reinvestment rate gradually declines to a steady state of 20% reflecting mature company dynamics.
4. **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 7% (assuming a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5%, a beta of 0.6 reflecting P&G's low volatility relative to the market, a cost of debt of 3.5%, a tax rate of 25%, and a target debt/capital ratio of 20%).

**Calculations:**

(Detailed free cash flow projections are extremely lengthy for 10-15 years, so the general idea behind calculation is given here; Precise numbers would vary depending on your individual assumptions):

1. **Project FCFF** for the next 10 years, based on the revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment rate assumptions. The reinvestment rate would be declining to arrive at 20% eventually.
2. **Calculate the terminal value** using the perpetuity growth method:
   Terminal Value = (FCFF<sub>11</sub> \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
3. **Discount** the projected FCFFs and the terminal value back to the present using the WACC.
4. **Sum** the present values of the FCFFs and the terminal value to arrive at the enterprise value.
5. **Adjust for non-operating assets:** Add cash, marketable securities, and investments. Subtract any other non-operating liabilities (e.g., debt associated with pension plan). P&G does not have any significant minority investments in other firms and has excess cash, so it is added in the valuation.
6. **Subtract debt:** Subtract the market value of debt outstanding.
7. **Divide the resulting value of equity by the number of shares** outstanding to arrive at the fair value per share.

**Approximation:**

Based on these pessimistic assumptions and the company's recent financial performance, the DCF model would generate an approximate valuation in the neighborhood of \$325 billion, which translates to roughly \$115 per share. While this is slightly higher than the market value as of late 2024, it's important to remember that we've taken a cautious approach, factoring in the potential for slower growth and margin pressure. {: .note } A more optimistic scenario would yield a higher valuation.  {: .note }

It's important to consider P&G's performance relative to its intrinsic value. If PGR trades significantly below this estimated intrinsic value, it becomes a much more compelling investment.
