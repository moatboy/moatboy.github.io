{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

A moat rating of 3/5 acknowledges TMO's strengths while reflecting concerns about its durability.

* **Switching Costs:** TMO benefits significantly from switching costs, particularly in its analytical instruments and laboratory products businesses.  Once a lab or research facility integrates TMO's equipment and software into its workflow, changing suppliers becomes a complex, time-consuming, and expensive undertaking.  In the Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO stated, "Our customers really value the ecosystem, and that's a big reason that they stay with us." (See Exhibit 11.4) This customer stickiness has enabled TMO to maintain premium pricing and generate outsized profits. (See Chapter 4 of *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*).
* **Brand Recognition:** TMO’s brand carries weight, particularly within the scientific community.  Although brand recognition does not automatically translate into a moat (See Chapter 3 of *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*), in this case, it reinforces the switching costs. Researchers and lab technicians trust the reliability and quality associated with TMO products, further discouraging them from experimenting with alternative suppliers.
* **Scale Advantages:**  In certain niches like specialty diagnostics and particular lab product categories, TMO possesses considerable scale advantages, making it difficult for smaller competitors to compete. (See Chapter 7 of *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*).  The company's global reach and diversified product portfolio further enhance this advantage.
* **Patents:** TMO has a large patent portfolio that provides some protection. However, patents have a finite life (See Chapter 3 of *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*) and face constant challenges from competitors seeking workarounds.  This dynamic limits the long-term competitive advantage conferred by patents.

**Management:**

Management receives a rating of 3/5, recognizing a mixed track record and potential concerns.

* **Capital Allocation:** While TMO has generally done well with reinvesting its copious cash flows to support growth, there have been missteps.  The company's forays into non-core areas, like the $30 billion acquisition of PPD in 2021, have yet to demonstrate a compelling strategic rationale. (See Chapter 19 of *The Intelligent Investor* on acquisitions). The acquisition rationale primarily seems oriented towards boosting EPS rather than enhancing intrinsic value. (See Chapter 15 of *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* on mergers and acquisitions.)  Marc Goedhart, in *Valuation*, highlights the importance of focusing on real value creation rather than EPS accretion in acquisitions.  In the Q1 2023 earnings call, management stated, "We expect to deliver on our revenue and EPS guidance for the year.", but failed to address any concerns about overpaying for acquisitions or strategic justifications behind acquisitions, raising concerns.
* **Communication:** Management's communication is mixed. While the company provides detailed financial statements and regularly conducts earnings calls, its communication often lacks depth about long-term strategy and the rationale behind major capital allocation decisions.   TMO's messaging often seems tailored toward promoting short-term financial results, potentially attracting short-term investors rather than creating a solid base of long-term, intrinsic-value-focused shareholders. (See Chapter 24 of *Valuation* on investor communication).
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation at TMO is very high, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.  The high proportion of stock options in executive compensation may create an incentive to prioritize stock-price appreciation over long-term value creation. (See Chapter II.E of *The Essays of Warren Buffett* on executive pay). 
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership at TMO is relatively low.  While not necessarily a negative indicator on its own, low insider ownership can reduce management’s alignment with shareholder interests. (See Chapter 24 of *Valuation*.)

**Catalyst:**

A catalyst rating of 2/5 suggests a lack of immediate, high-impact catalysts.

* **M&A:**  While there is always the potential for transformative acquisitions, TMO’s recent track record does not inspire confidence.  There are no clear near-term acquisition targets on the horizon, and management’s acquisitive nature could be a source of value destruction rather than creation if not executed carefully.  During the Q3 2023 earnings call, there was no mention of specific catalyst or changes that could significantly improve the financials in the near term, giving no comfort about future catalysts.
* **Margin Expansion:** There is potential for margin expansion as the company focuses on improving operational efficiency, but there have been multiple failures and significant declines in profitability over the past few years for some segments and the company overall. Moreover, competitive pressures and rising input costs could hinder progress in this area. (See Chapters 6 and 9 of *The Little Book of Valuation* on margins and profitability and competitive dynamics of industry growth). In the Q2 2023 earnings call, the CFO stated, "We remain confident in our ability to expand margins through productivity and pricing initiatives", but competitive pressures and rising input costs could hinder progress in this area, which the management did not address, causing concerns.
* **Share Repurchases:**  The company has been actively repurchasing shares, which could provide a modest boost to EPS.  However, share repurchases alone are not a sustainable driver of value creation and can be destructive if not done at prices below intrinsic value. (See Chapter 23 of *Valuation* on share repurchases).  

**Valuation:**

Valuation of $210 billion is derived using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with pessimistic assumptions.

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  3% terminal growth rate.  This assumes a deceleration from historical growth rates, reflecting concerns about increasing competition and maturing end markets for some of TMO's segments. The company states in its annual reports multiple times (for different segments) that, “We may not achieve substantial market share within a reasonable period”, which might mean lower growth for multiple segments and the company overall. So, an assumption lower than historical figures makes sense.
* **Margins:** Current margins are likely to compress slightly over time due to competitive pressures.  We assume operating margins of 9% in the terminal period.  In the Q1 2023 earnings call, the CEO mentioned about the company's strategy of driving continued profitable market share gain through their scale and innovation in portfolio, but competitive pressures might still lead to margin compression which the management did not address, so I have assumed a lower margin in the terminal period than the current one.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40% reinvestment rate, consistent with the company’s historical capital expenditure patterns. Since I have assumed a lower revenue growth rate and lower operating margin, there's a high probability that the company has to reinvest less in the near future as the need to invest will be reduced. But this reinvestment rate is still on a higher side.
* **Cost of Capital:**  9% cost of capital.  This is higher than the company’s current cost of capital but reflects an elevated risk premium due to the potential for value-destroying acquisitions and margin compression. I have assumed a high cost of capital to incorporate concerns about industry trends and high valuation.
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the perpetual growth model.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** Projected based on revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment rate assumptions for next 10 years.
2. **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the perpetual growth model with a 3% growth rate and a 9% cost of capital.
3. **Present Value of FCFF:** Discounted at 9% cost of capital for 10 years and terminal value to present.
4. **Enterprise Value:**  Sum of the present value of FCFF and cash.
5. **Equity Value:**  Enterprise Value - Debt + Cash.
6. **Value per Share:**  Equity Value / Shares Outstanding.

{: .note }

These calculations are approximate. A detailed DCF model would require a more granular forecast of individual line items, but this high-level analysis provides a starting point for valuation. I have excluded some segments from the valuation calculations, because financial details are not available. This calculation does not include minority interests.


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Cyclicality:** Some of TMO's end markets, like healthcare and industrial equipment, are cyclical.  This cyclicality adds another layer of uncertainty to the company's future cash flows and must be considered when valuing the firm. (See Chapter 11 of *The Little Book of Valuation*).
* **Debt Levels:** While TMO's current debt levels are manageable, its acquisitive nature could lead to a rapid increase in debt if the company funds future acquisitions with debt. This must be closely monitored.  (See Chapter 8 of *The Little Book of Valuation*).

**Overall Assessment:**

Thermo Fisher Scientific is a high-quality company with a wide moat, but its current valuation seems stretched given the concerns about its management, lack of a strong near-term catalyst, and the inherent uncertainty in its end markets.  The company's acquisitive nature and high executive compensation raise further concerns.  While the company may continue to grow, the price seems to incorporate very optimistic assumptions about the future, leaving little room for error or upside.  I would recommend waiting for a better entry point before initiating a position.
