{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


>**Moat Rating Justification:**  A narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5 is assigned due to a combination of regulatory restrictions, some switching costs (primarily for its pipeline customers), and a degree of scale advantages. The switching costs and regulatory hurdles create some barriers to entry for smaller firms, and its large scale reduces its per-unit costs. These factors provide ET with some pricing power and protect its returns on capital. The moat rating is tempered, however, due to the commodity nature of its business and the relatively low regulatory hurdles (when compared to other utilities), which limit its pricing power and create a more competitive market than that faced by firms with stronger competitive advantages. 

>**Management Rating Justification:** A modest rating of 2 out of 5 is assigned due to several factors, including the partnership's focus on distributions, its debt-heavy capital structure, a mixed record on acquisitions, some recent accounting issues and controversies, and a more limited insider ownership than we would prefer. While the senior management has deep experience in the midstream space, a tendency to prioritize size over shareholder value creation and less than ideal communication practices warrant a less-than-stellar management rating. The relatively low insider ownership further reduces management's score.


### Business Overview

**Revenues Distribution and Trends:** ET operates across four segments:

* **Intrastate Transportation and Storage:** This segment accounts for the largest share of ET's revenues and earnings, transporting natural gas primarily within Texas. Demand growth for natural gas transportation and storage services—and associated profits—will be directly tied to the overall economy, primarily on a secular basis. The competitive landscape in this segment is complex due to the commodity nature of its business. Its competitive advantage stems from its scale, which enables it to offer services at low cost. 
* **Interstate Transportation and Storage:** This segment's economics are extremely sensitive to energy prices. Revenue growth for natural gas pipelines—and associated profits—will be directly tied to natural gas production forecasts, which is an extremely difficult undertaking. Competition is more intense in this segment, with a large number of small players at bargain basement prices.  
* **Midstream:** This segment transports and processes natural gas, gathers and fractionates natural gas liquids (NGLs), and provides a wide variety of services. The company owns and operates natural gas gathering systems in various locations including West Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, East Texas, Pennsylvania, and North Texas. The company is a major player in natural gas processing, and it has been expanding steadily over the years. 
* **NGL and Refined Products Transportation and Services:** This segment transports, stores, and terminally handles and markets NGLs. The company also distributes and markets refined products. This business faces strong competition, especially from other midstream players such as Plains All American Pipeline. As a result of intensifying competition, this segment is likely to have lower profit margins than the other three segments. 


**Margins and Cost Advantages:** ET has a cost advantage over its peers because of its large size and low cost of operations. The firm achieves these cost savings through scale economies, efficient production methods, favorable location, and unique resources. The company’s financial statements, however, give only an aggregate, company-wide picture and don’t break down into individual business segments. This makes it difficult to have a nuanced discussion about the competitive advantages enjoyed by different parts of the organization. 

**Competitive Landscape:** The midstream industry is highly competitive. ET competes with a number of other large midstream companies, including Kinder Morgan, Enterprise Products Partners, and Williams Companies. The competitive landscape varies by segment. For instance, the intrastate natural gas transportation segment in Texas is more favorable than the interstate segment or crude oil transportation, because of high regulatory hurdles, which create barriers to entry for smaller competitors. The segment in which ET enjoys the largest degree of pricing power is natural gas transportation and storage, because the long-term contracts and regulatory approvals required to build and operate a pipeline create barriers to entry for smaller competitors. 

**What Makes ET Different:** ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in the United States. Its large scale gives it a cost advantage over its competitors, enabling it to offer goods and services at lower prices. Its geographic reach also creates mini-monopolies in some geographic areas.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Debt Levels:**  ET's high debt load has been a source of concern for investors. The company took on a substantial amount of debt to finance its growth-through-acquisition strategy.
* **Dakota Access Pipeline:** The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) has been the subject of numerous protests and legal challenges. The pipeline has also been the subject of several spills and leaks, raising environmental and safety concerns.
* **Accounting Issues:** The company changed its accounting for a portion of its noncontrolling interests in its financial statements, causing a one-time, noncash gain, and had to make retroactive adjustments for equity compensation on its financials, all of which made its reported earnings appear stronger than they actually are. This practice was criticized by several analysts and investors because it obscured the true economic reality of the underlying business.
* **Corporate Governance:** The CEO Kelcy Warren's history has been a cause of concern for investors and rating agencies. In 2016, Warren was investigated for insider trading after making well-timed sales of Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE) stock (the previous parent company) for approximately $68.1 million. The transaction resulted in a gain of roughly $26.5 million for Warren. Also, Warren purchased Energy Transfer's Dakota Access Pipeline just one day before Donald Trump's Presidential Executive Order to expedite the project. In 2017, Warren was criticized for his role in the DAPL protests, with some shareholders calling for his resignation. As another example of the CEO's questionable ethics, according to the annual proxy, Warren receives a symbolic one dollar annually but receives a rather generous restricted stock grant, in the neighborhood of $70 to $80 million annually for being the firm's chief executive officer and chairman of its board of directors. In addition, according to the annual proxy, Warren has a relatively low personal ownership stake in the company, which is another major corporate governance issue.




### Financial Analysis & Valuation

**Key Drivers of Value:**

* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** A firm creates value when it earns a rate of return on its investments that exceeds its cost of capital. Historically, ET has generated substantial returns on invested capital (ROIC), with a median ROIC above its cost of capital for the most recent five years.
* **Growth:**  Growth creates value only when the ROIC of the new investments is greater than the cost of capital. From an operational view, a company can achieve sustainable growth only through a combination of price increases, cost efficiencies, and increased volume and scale.
* **Capital Structure:** A poorly managed capital structure can lead to financial distress and destroy value, but research shows the influence of capital structure on value is limited. Energy Transfer's interest coverage is 1.55 times as of the third quarter of 2023, which corresponds to a B+/B rating. Overall, the company's debt-to-capital ratio of 60 percent is not unusually high. The company's cost of capital should be around 9 percent.
* **Financial Health and Solvency:** To overcome accounting distortions, a careful reorganization of the company's income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flow is required to obtain clean measures of operating profitability, invested capital, and free cash flow.


**Valuation Methodology:**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is the most reliable method to value a company. We use a 10-year DCF model to value ET, breaking down the company's future expected cash flow into two periods: a 5-year explicit forecast period and a 5-year continuing-value period. We recommend valuing the company using enterprise DCF (cash flow to the firm) rather than equity DCF (cash flow to equity) and making the appropriate adjustments to account for the side effects of noncore assets and liabilities. Our model also incorporates probability weighting for risk assessment.  We provide two scenario analyses of ET, one based on more favorable financial and macroeconomic conditions, and one based on a less-favorable outcome: 

**Scenario 1: Business as Usual:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We will use the average long-term historical revenue growth rate for the midstream sector from 1975 to 2011. Assuming a growth rate of 3.5 percent per year and applying the average growth rate of the midstream sector yields total revenue growth of 5 percent per year.  
* **Margins:** We assume a gradual recovery in margins over the next five years with margins returning to 15 percent by 2028.
* **ROIC:** As margins, reinvestment, and cost of capital all revert to historical average levels, ROIC would also tend towards average levels. By regressing operating income against invested capital, across US midstream sector companies over the last 55 years, we estimate ROIC should gradually decrease from 8 percent today to 6.25 percent in the terminal year.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use the CAPM model to determine the cost of equity. Risk-free rate = 4 percent. Beta = 1.2. Market risk premium = 4.5 percent.  As ET is predominantly an equity-funded company, this implies a cost of equity of approximately 9.4 percent and a pretax cost of debt of 5 percent.  Given the company's target capital structure (as communicated in a recent earnings call), tax rate, cost of equity and debt, the weighted average cost of capital will be at 9 percent. 
* **Terminal Value:** We derive the terminal value using the terminal year's after-tax operating income, discounted at the cost of capital of 9 percent. 

**Scenario 2: Mild Economic Downturn:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth will be below average, at 2 percent annually for the next five years.
* **Margins:** We assume margins would deteriorate further, reaching 10 percent in 2028. 
* **ROIC:** We assume ROIC declines to 4.25 percent in the terminal year
* **Cost of Capital:**  We maintain the same cost of capital and capital structure weights as for the previous scenario.  
* **Terminal Value:** The terminal value methodology is the same as for the base case scenario.

**Valuation Synthesis:**
Based on these scenarios and assumptions, the probability-weighted present value of ET's operating assets and subsequent enterprise value are as follows:


| Scenario                 | Probability | Present Value (billions) |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Business as Usual        | 60%        | $58                  |
| Mild Economic Downturn | 40%        | $34                  |
| **Weighted Average**    | **--**       | **$48.5**                 |



### Catalysts

>**Catalyst Rating Justification:**  A catalyst rating of 3 out of 5 is assigned. ET has several potential catalysts that could increase its share price. These include:
>1. **Simplification:** The company continues to move to a simpler structure, with several asset dropdowns, divestitures of non-core assets, and steps towards reducing its leverage, which can improve sentiment towards the stock.
>2. **Distribution Growth:** While the company's distribution growth has slowed, it still yields an attractive 7 percent, with the potential for further increases in the future. 
>3. **Improving Commodity Prices:** A sustained increase in commodity prices, especially natural gas, could boost the company's cash flows and, in turn, its share price.
>4. **Completion of Growth Projects:** The company has several growth projects underway, including the completion of the Lake Charles LNG liquefaction export project. The success of these projects could boost the company's earnings and cash flow, and in turn, its share price.
>5. **Acquisition of Crestwood:** The acquisition of Crestwood should add scale and create cost-saving opportunities.
>
>These factors provide ET with some visibility for increased investor confidence and improved profitability. The catalyst rating is not higher because the outlook for the commodity markets is always uncertain. Furthermore, the magnitude and timing of these catalyst effects is uncertain. 


###  Additional Notes and Considerations

* The DCF model does not explicitly incorporate the following potential "value plays" which might make the stock attractive to some investors: (1) potential synergies following its merger with Crestwood Midstream Partners LP; (2) synergies with Sunoco LP; (3) the opportunity to increase pricing power or market share in its various businesses, or any other opportunities identified as growth initiatives or nonorganic growth initiatives on the proxy statements and related risk factors or other filings; (4) the sale or abandonment of operations not meeting financial targets, including subsidiaries or assets that management or its board deemed to be non-strategic; (5) acquisition opportunities in the midstream space; (6) regulatory or legal changes, and any other initiatives that were highlighted in earnings calls and press releases; or (7) a stock buyback or share repurchases. Each of these possible opportunities can impact valuations.
* There is an element of timing in any stock investment, and many investment advisors recommend against holding a company or stock you purchased during a rally. For many businesses, however, DCF model may not reflect market valuation in a meaningful way. The stock-picking prowess of a Warren Buffet or George Soros stems from identifying inconsistencies between their own valuations and the market.
* This report focuses on the company's U.S. operations. It does not provide an estimate of the value of the company's operations in Canada, Europe, or Asia, primarily because the required information for a thorough assessment of those regions (detailed financials, economic data, legal structure, etc.) was not readily available. In addition, the earnings calls for the relevant businesses were not available to us. Nor does the model include any value for future international expansion or earnings growth.
