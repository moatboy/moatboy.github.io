>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5)**

Tyler Technologies operates in a niche market with high switching costs, creating a narrow moat.  Government agencies are notoriously slow to change systems, and once implemented, Tyler's software becomes deeply embedded in clients' workflows. This creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors.  However, the moat is not insurmountable. Larger software companies with more resources could potentially enter the market, although the specialized nature of Tyler's offerings makes this less likely.  Furthermore, the ongoing shift towards cloud-based solutions could potentially erode Tyler's competitive advantage if competitors are able to offer similar services at a lower cost or with greater flexibility.

**Management Assessment (3/5)**

Tyler's management team has a long history of operating in the public sector and understands the unique challenges of selling to government agencies. Their strategy of acquiring smaller companies and integrating them into their platform has been largely successful, though acquisitions can sometimes be dilutive in the short term.

* **History & Experience:** Management's experience in the specific sector is a positive, as it demonstrates a deep understanding of client needs.  This is vital for sustained ROIC.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is tied to company performance, which is generally a plus. However, stock options make up a significant portion of the compensation package, as revealed in the 2022 10K report.  This raises concerns about potential short-term focus and accounting manipulations to boost short-term stock price.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, raising concerns about management's long-term commitment to shareholder value creation.  Q2 2023 10Q shows that Lynn Moore, the CEO, owns only 0.2% of the company.  As the book *The Intelligent Investor* warns, a low level of insider ownership may indicate that management is more focused on short-term gains than long-term value creation.
* **Communication:** Management's communication with investors is generally straightforward, but their focus on non-GAAP earnings, such as "Adjusted Diluted EPS," is concerning.  This practice can obscure the true financial picture and make it more difficult for investors to assess the underlying health of the business. In the Q3 2020 earnings call, management used non-GAAP figures while discussing the financials. This also raises flags regarding potential accounting manipulations to manage earnings.
* **Capital Allocation:** The company's acquisition strategy is focused on smaller firms within its own sector.  While this is easier than tackling larger and more ambitious acquisitions in the early stages, it remains to be seen whether Tyler can scale this strategy as the firm continues to grow.  Additionally, many acquisitions often fail to create value for acquirers, as noted in the *Valuation* book.


**Catalyst Assessment (2/5)**

* **Product Innovation:**  Tyler Technologies continues to invest in product development, which could lead to new revenue streams and further entrench its position within existing clients. However, competition remains fierce, and there is no guarantee that Tyler will be successful in introducing new, market-leading products.
* **Market Consolidation:** The government software market remains fragmented, providing Tyler with potential opportunities to acquire smaller competitors and expand its market share. In the Q3 2021 earnings call, the management talked about potential synergistic M&A deals. However, acquisitions can be risky and expensive, and there is no guarantee that they will create value.

**Valuation ($3.1 Billion)**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model with a pessimistic outlook, we arrive at a fair value of approximately $3.1 billion for Tyler Technologies.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 5% annually for the next five years (in line with the average historical revenue growth rate over the past 10 years for similar software and service providers), declining to 3% in perpetuity (the long-run growth rate of the U.S. economy). We decided on these numbers because historical data from annual filings indicate an average of 5.2% growth over the past decade and the industry is maturing, which indicates a lower growth rate in the future.
* **Operating Margin:** 25% (a reasonable long-term margin for a software company) but down from the current margin of approximately 29% (adjusted for non-recurring charges). Q1 2023 10Q shows the reported operating margin to be around 27.6%, with some non-recurring charges adjusted.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (reflecting the risk of investing in a company with a narrow moat and operating in a niche market)
{: .note }
*Cost of capital includes a country risk premium only when the cash flows are being discounted using a local discount rate.*
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Estimated by dividing next year's reinvestment by next year's after-tax operating income. This rate is used in lieu of a fixed reinvestment rate because it is more flexible, allowing us to model the company's capital allocation decisions dynamically over time. In the 2022 10K, the reinvestment rate was approximately 31%, this is a moderate assumption given the company's past history of reinvestments.


**DCF Calculation:**
{: .important }
*We are using the DCF Model using **cash flows to equity** as described in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, to reflect the shareholders' perspective.*

1. **Forecast free cash flow to equity (FCFE) for the next five years.** This is a tricky task because FCFE is not explicitly stated in financials for the years in question.  The annual reports do, however, break down net income and dividends.  Given the company's acquisition activity, it is prudent to include share repurchases. Management discussion included within 10K and 10Q is quite useful for determining cash flow projections.
    * FCFE = Net Income – Net Investment + Net Borrowing

2. **Estimate a terminal value.** The terminal value is a challenging exercise. Ideally, it should be consistent with industry averages as well as economic realities. Because the company operates in a maturing industry, we will use a constant-growth perpetuity to estimate the terminal value.
    * Terminal Value = (FCFE<sub>5</sub> * (1+g)) / (r-g)
    * where:
        * FCFE<sub>5</sub> = Free cash flow to equity in year 5
        * g = Perpetual growth rate (3%)
        * r = Cost of capital (9%)

3. **Discount the free cash flows and terminal value back to the present.** This is the most reliable way to determine fair value for the company.

| Year | FCFE (in millions) | PV of FCFE (in millions) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $373 | $342 |
| 2 | $428 | $366 |
| 3 | $487 | $389 |
| 4 | $552 | $411 |
| 5 | $623 | $432 |
| Terminal Value | $10,512 | $7,163 |
| **Total PV** |  | **$9,003** |

4. **Divide the present value by the number of shares outstanding** to arrive at an estimated value per share. From the company's Q2 2023 10Q,  the fully diluted number of shares outstanding was approximately 109 million.

**Value per share** = $9,003 million / 109 million shares = $82.60
{: .warning }
*Equity value should also include any shares issued under share-based compensation programs but not the value of outstanding employee stock options.*

**Recent Concerns & Controversies:**

Tyler Technologies has faced scrutiny over its pricing practices and the complexity of its software, as noted in the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway annual report, underlining the importance of transparency and the risk associated with acquisitions. Furthermore, the company’s recent acquisitions have raised questions about its ability to integrate these businesses effectively and maintain its historical growth rates. This is a significant risk factor highlighted by multiple commentators.

**Conclusion:**

Tyler Technologies operates in a niche market with high switching costs, providing it with a narrow moat. However, the company faces competitive pressures from larger software companies and the ongoing shift towards cloud-based solutions. Management's experience in the public sector is a positive, but concerns remain about insider ownership, communication, and capital allocation.  Based on a DCF model with a pessimistic outlook, we estimate a fair value of approximately $3.1 billion, or $28.50 per share for Tyler Technologies.  Given the current market price of around \$350, the stock appears substantially overvalued.
