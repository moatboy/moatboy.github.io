Pessimistic value: $410 B

Johnson & Johnson, a prominent player in the health care sector, boasts a wide moat primarily derived from intangible assets—specifically, its powerful brand portfolio and patent protection for its pharmaceutical products.  This allows the company to charge premium prices and maintain significant market share in various segments. I am giving the moat a rating of 4/5 because it's not an absolute monopoly and faces challenges, especially as patents expire and competitive pressures increase.  However, the diversity of its products across consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices provides a strong base for sustained profitability.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .important }

Moats are not about great products, great execution, or great management—they’re about the structural characteristics of a business, as discussed in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_.

**Management:** I'm assigning a 3/5 rating to JNJ's management.  While the company has historically demonstrated strong capital allocation through share repurchases and dividends, there are reasons for a more critical view. The company's R&D productivity has been lackluster, and its expansion into new business lines has not always been successful. There are also concerns about its handling of legal issues, particularly those surrounding its talc products.

{: .note }

While past performance is no guarantee of future results, a company with a history of making good capital allocation decisions is more likely to deliver decent returns to its shareholders, especially for a mature company.

* **History & Experience:** JNJ's long history in the market speaks to its ability to weather industry ups and downs, and its executive officers typically have decades of experience at the firm (see 2023 10-K for details).  However, past success doesn't guarantee future performance.  
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is substantial (see proxy statement), but it's aligned with performance relative to the market and competitors. Excessive CEO pay relative to performance, as warned against by Warren Buffett in his essays, is not evident here.
* **Communication:**  JNJ provides detailed segment information (see financial reports), but it could do a better job providing more transparency regarding R&D productivity and its pipeline. In the Q3 2024 earnings call, CEO Joaquin Duato was pressed about the company's focus on improving profitability rather than pursuing growth. He argued that their pursuit of superior profitability will actually allow them to have faster growth, with the caveat that this strategy applies to mature companies. This is a realistic, if unexciting, take on where JNJ is in its corporate life cycle.
* **Capital Allocation:**  Historically, share repurchases have been the key driver of increasing shareholder value (see _The Essays of Warren Buffet_). This makes sense for mature companies with a surplus of cash and limited reinvestment opportunities. JNJ seems to understand this reality.
* **Insider Ownership:**  While insider ownership is not excessively high, it is high enough to suggest that managers' interests are aligned with those of shareholders.

{: .warning }

Management matters less than many pundits would have you believe, especially in mature businesses. Companies that try to compete solely on “management” often present the illusion of a moat, as discussed in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_.

**Catalyst:** The catalyst rating is 2/5. The planned separation of its consumer health business, Kenvue, while promising, is not a game-changer. There is also some skepticism that JNJ will succeed in growing its pharmaceutical and medical device businesses at a faster rate, following the spin-off. Potential catalysts for upward movement in the stock price include FDA approvals for new drugs, successful clinical trial results, and accretive acquisitions. In the Q3 2024 earnings call, management discussed its pharmaceutical segment, emphasizing progress in its pipeline, notably the results of its Carvykti clinical trials for multiple myeloma patients and the positive clinical data for its Nipocalimab trials for patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. These drugs, if they come to market, will drive earnings growth for the company in the future.

**Business in Detail:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** JNJ operates in three segments: pharmaceutical, medical devices, and consumer health. Pharmaceuticals is the largest segment (see 2023 10-K), followed by MedTech and consumer health. Sales are geographically diversified (see 2023 10-K for details).
* **Industry Trends:** The health care sector is undergoing significant shifts, including an aging population, increasing health care costs, and technological disruptions.  JNJ is exposed to these trends, and its ability to adapt will determine its future success. The entry and exit rates of startups in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries are quite high, which is consistent with _Measuring the Moat_. However, companies with established brands and a solid customer base like JNJ have a higher probability of success.
* **Margins:** JNJ maintains relatively stable and healthy operating margins despite pricing pressure in some segments (see financial reports and earnings calls).
* **Competitive Landscape:** JNJ faces competition from large, well-financed competitors in all of its segments (see _Measuring the Moat_ for examples). It leverages its strong brand portfolio and economies of scale to maintain its competitive position.
* **Differentiation:**  JNJ's brand portfolio differentiates it in the consumer health segment, allowing it to command premium prices (see _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_ for a discussion of brands as a source of a moat).  In pharmaceuticals and medical devices, its investments in R&D and resultant patented products provide an edge, though these advantages have a limited lifespan.
* **What Makes JNJ Different?**  JNJ’s diversification across a wide range of products and businesses makes it unique, providing a layer of stability and resilience (see _The Intelligent Investor_).

**Financial Analysis:**

A careful review of JNJ's financial statements (see 10-Ks and 10-Qs) reveals a mature company with stable operations and consistent cash flows. Earnings have been growing modestly. (In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management discussed the challenging macroeconomic environment and volatility. However, the company's diversification helped it to deliver relatively stable earnings growth.)

{: .note }

Key factors in valuing a company are the expected cash flows, and the risk associated with them, as discussed in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_.

**Valuation:**

To arrive at a fair value, I will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, valuing each segment separately and then summing the parts. The DCF is the most appropriate valuation method for a company with substantial tangible assets.  (Given the inconsistencies of accounting, there is less risk of making mistakes in valuation when you value the entire business—the firm—using an enterprise DCF. Also, the DCF model does the best job highlighting the drivers of value creation: return on invested capital [ROIC] and growth, as discussed in _Valuation_ by McKinsey.)


**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations (in $ billions):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Given the mature nature of the business and recent performance, I’ll assume a modest average annual revenue growth of 3% for all three segments for the next 10 years. In the Q3 2024 earnings call, the CEO expressed optimism about the potential for future revenue growth from new drug launches. Nevertheless, given the history of difficulty in sustaining high growth for companies, as presented in _Valuation_ by McKinsey, I am choosing to maintain a relatively conservative view here.
* **Operating Margin:** I’ll assume a stable operating margin of 20% for the next 10 years. JNJ's margins have been reasonably stable in the past (see financial reports), and this assumption reflects my expectation that margin improvement will be difficult in the face of competitive pressures and rising costs. (Again, in the Q3 2024 earnings call, the company's focus on profitability is encouraging, and I could be slightly too pessimistic about its potential for margin improvement in the future.)
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Based on historical data and assuming limited growth opportunities, I'll use a reinvestment rate of 40%.
* **Cost of Capital:** I'll use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7%. This incorporates a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4%, and a beta of 0.9 for the company's equity. (I'm choosing to err on the conservative side with this assumption, reflecting the uncertainties surrounding the litigation and competitive pressures.)
* **Terminal Value:**  After 10 years, I'll assume a terminal growth rate of 2%, reflecting the long-term growth rate of the economy.

{: .highlight }

The terminal value computation is sensitive to small changes in the growth rate. (Also, in the real world, the interest rate on 10-year government bonds varies from day to day, and there is not much a financial analyst can do about it.)

**DCF Calculation (in $ billions):**

| Year | Free Cash Flow to Firm | PV |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $27.2 | $25.4 |
| 2 | $28.1 | $24.4 |
| 3 | $28.9 | $23.5 |
| 4 | $29.8 | $22.6 |
| 5 | $30.7 | $21.8 |
| 6 | $31.7 | $21.0 |
| 7 | $32.7 | $20.2 |
| 8 | $33.7 | $19.5 |
| 9 | $34.8 | $18.8 |
| 10 | $35.9 | $18.1 |
| Terminal Value | $410 | $225.7 |
| **Total Firm Value** |  | **$410** |


The resulting value per share for the company, after adjusting for debt and cash, is approximately $155. Given the uncertainties and risks facing JNJ, including potential litigation costs and regulatory headwinds, this fair value represents a reasonable estimate. 

{: .note }

In valuations, you risk being “precisely wrong” rather than “approximately right.” I am intentionally using round numbers to avoid getting bogged down by false precision.

**Final Word:**

JNJ is a solid company with a wide moat. Its diversified business and brand portfolio provide a strong platform for long-term growth. However, the company faces challenges, including litigation risk and pricing pressure in some of its segments. Management's ability to successfully navigate these challenges will determine whether the company delivers excess returns to shareholders in the future. Given the current valuation, which is significantly below my estimate of intrinsic value, JNJ looks like a compelling long-term investment.  However, given the legal and competitive headwinds the company faces, there are considerable downside risks that warrant a large margin of safety.
