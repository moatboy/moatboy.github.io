{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Cardinal Health's moat is primarily derived from economies of scale and customer stickiness. The company's extensive distribution network and scale make it a formidable player in pharmaceutical and medical product distribution. However, its moat is narrow because its scale advantage is primarily regional, not national. As such, it gets a rating of 2 / 5.

> This is further reinforced by Michael Porter's five forces framework, which indicates that the bargaining power of buyers, and, the threat of new entrants are not insignificant, thereby limiting the chances for sustainable excess returns.

{: .note }

>In their Q1 Fiscal 2024 Earnings call, Cardinal Health's management noted that their scale and distribution network gives them an advantage over competitors in serving pharmaceutical and medical products distribution.


**Management (3/5):**

Cardinal Health's management team is comprised of both tenured and newer members. Their CEO, Jason Hollar, was appointed in 2022. Some key executives have more than five years of experience with the firm.

{: .note }

This is a concern from a corporate governance perspective because of the increased importance of the CEO in creating and destroying shareholder value.

{: .note }

>The business experience summary provided for the executives in Cardinal Health's 10-K filings suggest that most of the management team has primarily finance and accounting, not operations, backgrounds.  This suggests an increased focus on EPS accretion, which may not translate into value creation.


The management team’s compensation is largely tied to EPS growth and stock price performance, which may create a short-term focus and may incentivize them to prioritize short-term gains over long-term value creation.

{: .warning }

>Executive compensation in recent years has heavily weighted share price and stock options - a frequent recipe for disaster. There has been push back by investor activists to use share buybacks instead of dividends.

{: .important }

>In Cardinal Health’s Q1 Fiscal 2024 Earnings call, management noted that executive compensation is heavily weighted toward earnings per share and stock price performance.


Finally, insider ownership in the company appears low, raising a concern about how much management's incentives are aligned with shareholders'.

{: .important }

>Cardinal Health's insiders only own about 0.2% of the shares outstanding, according to the company’s latest proxy statement, significantly below the average for S&P 500 companies, according to recent research.

{: .note }

>In Cardinal Health’s Q4 Fiscal 2023 earnings call, in response to a question about stock ownership and management incentives, the CEO noted that share repurchases would continue to be a significant portion of their capital allocation strategy going forward. This does not bode well, given the recent research on the value-destructive nature of stock repurchases.


Given the above factors the management gets a rating of 3 / 5.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

There are a few potential upcoming catalysts that could increase Cardinal Health's share price, including:

* **Acquisitions:** The company has a history of making acquisitions, and it's possible that it could make another one in the near future. If the acquisition is successful, it could boost the company's earnings and share price. 

{: .note }

>In Cardinal Health’s Q1 Fiscal 2024 earnings call, management discussed completing the acquisition of a national medication dispensing business during the quarter. The purchase price was not disclosed, but the acquired company had annual sales of about $35 million.

* **Cost-cutting measures:** The company has been implementing a number of cost-cutting measures, and it's possible that these measures could start to pay off in the near future. If the company can successfully reduce its costs, it could improve its profitability and make its shares more attractive to investors.

{: .note }

>In Cardinal Health’s Fiscal Year 2020 earnings call, management noted that they had initiated an accelerated share repurchase program to reduce share count by about 2%.


Given the above factors the catalyst gets a rating of 2 / 5.


**Valuation ($60.70 Billion):**

To come up with a fair value for Cardinal Health, I used a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model. This is the most commonly used valuation method, and it is based on the idea that the value of a company is equal to the present value of its future cash flows. 


The key inputs to a DCF model are:


* **Cash flows:** To estimate Cardinal Health's future cash flows, I started with the company's current cash flows and then made a few adjustments to remove the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the recent acquisition of Specialty Networks.  I then used a three-stage growth model, with higher growth rates in the earlier years, and then lower growth rates in the later years. I assumed that Cardinal Health’s free cash flow will grow at a rate of 3% in perpetuity, well below the historical average. In addition, I assumed Cardinal Health's reinvestment rate will eventually fall back towards 10%—a reasonable assumption, given the company’s strong financial health and solid earnings history.


* **Discount rate:** The discount rate is the rate of return that investors expect to earn on their investment in the company.  The appropriate discount rate for Cardinal Health is 8.2%. To arrive at this number, I used the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach and a terminal rate of 3%, based on U.S. long-term treasury bonds.

{: .note }

Since Cardinal Health is exposed to business risk from the pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, I also calculated a long-run cost of equity of between 9 and 11% and an unlevered (all-equity) beta of between 0.9 and 1.1 based on the median of the unlevered betas of a sample of Cardinal Health's industry peers.

* **Terminal value:** The terminal value is the value of the company at the end of the explicit forecast period (in this case, 10 years). To estimate Cardinal Health's terminal value, I used the perpetual growth model. This model assumes that the company will continue to grow at a constant rate forever.


{: .note }

> Note: My valuation assumes that the current management team continues to execute on its current strategy, and I make no adjustments for the possibility of management changes in the future. In Cardinal Health’s Q2 Fiscal 2020 earnings call, management noted the appointment of Patricia English as executive vice president and chief financial officer. In the short term, this has little effect on the firm's valuation. In the long term, however, this may affect how investors value the company.

After all these adjustments and calculations, we arrive at the estimated equity value of **$60.70 billion**.

> Discounting Cardinal Health's projected free cash flows at the WACC of 8.2 percent and adding the cash yields an equity value of about $60.70 billion and a per-share value of approximately $54.


**Financial Summary:**

Cardinal Health's revenue comes from the following sources:

* **Pharmaceutical:** This segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical products to retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. It also provides pharmacy services to retail and hospital pharmacies. In FY22, this segment accounted for 96% of sales.
* **Medical:** This segment manufactures and sources medical, surgical, and laboratory products and distributes those products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and physician offices. In FY22, this segment accounted for 4% of sales.


The company's margins have been under pressure in recent years due to increased competition and the expiration of some key patents. However, the company has been able to offset some of these margin pressures by implementing cost-cutting measures.

{: .note }

> In Cardinal Health’s FY23 earnings call, management noted the ongoing importance of their generic drugs program. Although there are many competitors in generics, the low-cost nature of these products provides an opportunity for companies like Cardinal Health to increase profitability.



**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

Cardinal Health has been involved in a number of recent lawsuits related to the opioid crisis. These lawsuits are a concern because they could have a significant impact on the company's financial results.

{: .warning }

> In Cardinal Health’s Q1 Fiscal 2024 earnings call, the company discussed recent settlement agreements involving opioid litigation, including a nationwide settlement to resolve legal proceedings involving the company's sale and distribution of opioids. Although the settlements remove much of the uncertainty for the company, they don't address the risks and uncertainties concerning the pending pursuit of additional recoveries on the existing judgment by states, local political subdivisions, tribes, hospitals, and other claimants.
