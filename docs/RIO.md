**Business Overview**

Rio Tinto's business can be broadly categorized into the following product groups:

* **Iron Ore:**  Rio Tinto is one of the world's largest producers of iron ore, a critical component in steelmaking.  The majority of its iron ore operations are in Western Australia's Pilbara region.  This segment generates the bulk of the company's revenue and earnings.

* **Aluminum:** The company is a significant player in the aluminum market, producing bauxite, alumina, and aluminum. Operations span Australia, Canada, Guinea, Iceland, and New Zealand.  Although aluminum is a cyclical commodity, Rio Tinto benefits from having some of the lowest production costs in the industry.

* **Copper:**  Rio Tinto produces copper and copper by-products through mines located in the United States, Chile, Mongolia, and Indonesia.  Copper is a key component in electrical wiring and plumbing.

* **Minerals:** This segment includes borates, titanium dioxide feedstocks, salt, and high-quality iron ore.  Rio Tinto's borates operations have a cost advantage, and its titanium dioxide business benefits from rising demand driven by paint and sunscreen use.  Salt is a stable business, while iron ore prices can be quite volatile.

* **Diamonds:** Rio Tinto owns and operates the Diavik diamond mine in Canada and the Argyle diamond mine in Australia.  Diamonds are typically used in jewelry, but they also have industrial applications.  The Argyle mine, a source of rare pink and red diamonds, closed in 2020.

**Industry Trends**

The mining and metals industry is cyclical, with commodity prices fluctuating based on global economic conditions and supply and demand.  Demand for various metals is linked to economic growth and investment in infrastructure.  There is a trend toward industry consolidation, with larger miners acquiring smaller ones to gain scale and efficiencies. Climate change and increased regulations are affecting the mining industry, with pressures on companies to reduce their environmental footprint and adopt sustainable mining practices.

**Margins**

Margins in the mining and metals industry can be substantial but are sensitive to commodity price fluctuations. Rio Tinto benefits from cost leadership in several of its product segments, especially iron ore and aluminum, but its overall margins have been pressured recently.

**Moat Analysis and Rating**

Rio Tinto's moat rating is 2 out of 5, indicating a **narrow** moat. While Rio Tinto benefits from cost advantages in iron ore and aluminum, and a few of its mineral segments may enjoy some modest pricing power, commodity industries are inherently cyclical. Even the best cost producer can be challenged by falling prices. The company has a leading position in some of its segments, which can confer advantages of scale. However, the long-term cyclical nature of the industry and the potential for technological innovation to disrupt commodity markets, particularly the long-term role of iron ore in the steel industry, introduces a large amount of uncertainty.  Further, governments can heavily influence profitability and competitive dynamics in resource-rich countries. There's a considerable amount of political and regulatory risk. 

**Valuation**

>To perform a valuation, I used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model using data from Rio Tinto's 20F filings from 2019 through 2023. The most recent 20F from 2023 does not include a full-year cash flow calculation.
>
>I took a conservative approach by considering an average long-run economic growth rate for the global economy of 3.0%, even though recent years saw 5% growth, and assuming zero growth in a company's terminal value. Since RIO operates in commodity markets which are cyclical and volatile, the long-term return on capital will probably regress toward the company's cost of capital and consequently excess returns will probably disappear, as they typically do. This assumption concerning continuing value makes the valuation somewhat pessimistic but arguably more realistic as well.
>
>For the cost of capital, I used an industry-adjusted measure (for details, see [valuation]). As the company has a bond rating of A- using this industry-adjusted figure, we estimated the cost of equity to be 10.35%, with a 2.56% risk-free rate and a market risk premium of 5.76%. Also, the cost of debt is 5.65%, reflecting that the company has a good bond rating. Using the leverage ratio, which can be computed as the ratio of the market value of the company's debt divided by the market value of the firm, we used market values for equity and debt in the computation of the company's WACC of 7.24%.
>
>For this valuation, I used reported earnings per share, and dividends to estimate cash flow and compute continuing values. I used the business-as-usual case for revenues, assuming average inflation and commodity prices. 
>

**Calculations**

1. **Determine terminal value:**

Since it is unlikely that Rio Tinto will earn ROICs above the cost of capital during the continuing period, a reasonable terminal growth rate should be equal to the long-run real growth rate of the global economy (3%). Thus, the reinvestment rate is zero and the company's after-tax operating income will remain at the same level as at the end of the explicit forecast period. Since commodity prices are cyclical, and since we forecast a downturn by 2029, we assumed that 2028 net income would represent its average performance over the coming decades.

2. **Discount cash flows and terminal value:** To compute present value, we used the 7.24% cost of capital as the discount rate.  The company pays no dividends, so only free cash flows are discounted.

3. **Compute the total value of operating assets:**  This is the sum of the present value of the explicit forecast period and the present value of the continuing value.

4. **Value of non-operating assets:**

> Rio Tinto had about $2.4 billion in net cash or $1.5 billion in excess cash and marketable securities. These should be included as non-operating assets on the balance sheet, because it is cash that is not needed for operations.
>
>The firm also had some minority passive investments, which were valued at $3.5B. 
>
>This amounted to $5B in non-operating assets, which must be added to the value of operating assets and equity values to arrive at total equity value.
>

5. **Value of Debt:**

> Rio Tinto's total debt was about $12 billion. It has a very good rating of A- meaning that it would be better for the investor to consider their bonds directly, instead of owning the equity in the firm itself.
>

6. **Calculate total enterprise value:**

> Add up non-operating assets (cash, marketable securities, minority holdings), the value of operations, and then subtract the current value of outstanding debt.
>
>$83B + $5B - $12B = $76B.

**Valuation Sensitivity**

With a more pessimistic growth forecast for the global economy of 2%, the discounted cash flow model shows that Rio Tinto would be worth only $63B. With a more optimistic cost of capital of 8%, the company would be worth $74B. This sensitivity analysis serves as a reminder about the highly sensitive relationship between macroeconomic conditions and company value.

**Final Recommendation**

Although Rio Tinto has a narrow moat and a dominant position in certain commodities, investors should carefully weigh the cyclical nature of the business and consider valuations closely. Given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook and a more pessimistic long-run growth estimate of 3%, an appropriate valuation appears to be in the neighborhood of $88B (total value using the DCF model, multiplied by 1.15 to get to total equity value). At any price substantially above this level, the downside risk greatly exceeds the upside potential, and the stock should therefore be avoided. At a substantial discount (based on current macro economic trends), a position could be considered.

**Additional Notes:**

* This valuation is highly dependent on commodity price assumptions.  
* Management incentives and capital allocation can have a significant impact on long-term value creation.
*  The possibility of large unforeseen write-offs must also be considered.
