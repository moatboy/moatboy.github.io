>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.
### Business Overview

KKR's business model is built around earning fees for managing investor funds, as well as making strategic investments and generating profits. Their main sources of revenue are management fees (charged annually as a percentage of assets under management) and transaction fees (charged when KKR acquires, sells or restructures investments on behalf of its funds), though these fees can vary in their terms. In addition, when KKR deploys its own capital, it captures the economic upside (through earnings and appreciation) or the downside (through losses and impairment) by holding its stake for longer time periods.

#### Revenue Distribution and Trends:

KKR operates across four reportable segments:

* **Asset Management:**  This segment constitutes the bulk of KKR's business, accounting for the majority of revenue. It encompasses management fees for overseeing investor capital, transaction fees related to investment activities, and monitoring and other fees. KKR earns money by providing investment management services across its four main investing strategies: private equity, credit and liquid strategies, real estate, and infrastructure.

* **Insurance:**  This segment derives revenue primarily from originating and investing in certain insurance products, including life insurance and annuity products, primarily in the United States.

* **Capital Markets:** KKR's capital markets business serves as an internal resource for both managing principal investments and facilitating transactions on behalf of the investment funds and accounts as well as clients. Within this segment, they perform underwriting and placement of securities and other brokerage transactions.

* **Principal Activities:** Principal activities consist of investments made by KKR itself rather than for its funds.

The industry has benefited from two main trends: increased institutionalization and the availability of cheap funding.  Both trends have created enormous AUM growth in the alternative investment management industry. However, competition has also increased with new competitors emerging, and increased complexity and regulatory scrutiny. 

#### Margins and Profitability:

KKR's margins (operating margins and pretax margins) are healthy, but they fluctuate periodically for financial reasons (such as an economic downturn) or management reasons (such as excessive investment). Return on invested capital (ROIC) varies across industry and company size, but successful alternative asset managers have delivered high ROICs for extended periods of time, as documented in the provided resources. 

### Moat Analysis and Rating (2/5)

While KKR possesses some attributes that contribute to a competitive advantage, its moat is narrow and faces increasing pressure. 

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** KKR has a strong brand name in the alternative asset management space, but this is not exclusive in an environment where fund performance drives the narrative. {: .highlight}
* **Switching Costs:** KKR's investor base is largely institutional, with high switching costs, providing some protection from competition. There is a substantial incentive for fund investors to remain invested in funds that are performing well. Switching between fund managers can also entail logistical costs and the risk of missing out on continued success with an established manager. 
* **Scale:** KKR's size does provide some cost advantages, and its scale allows it to pursue a more diversified set of investment opportunities. KKR's size provides substantial advantages in fundraising, reducing its risk relative to smaller firms.

However, these moat attributes are not sufficient to warrant a higher rating:

* **Performance Dependence:** The alternative asset management industry is heavily performance-driven. KKR's success is intrinsically tied to its ability to generate alpha.  {: .important} If performance slips, investors are likely to move their capital elsewhere, regardless of switching costs.
* **Key-Person Risk:**  While KKR is growing its next generation of leaders, much of the firm's success remains linked to its founding partners. However, as demonstrated in the provided "The Essays of Warren Buffett" resource, management can play a significant role and can counteract the influence of key personnel on a firm's overall performance.
* **Increasing Competition:** As the industry consolidates, competition for both institutional capital and investment opportunities is intensifying, pressuring fees and potentially returns.
* **Regulation:**  Increased regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry could limit KKR's flexibility and compress margins. 

**Moat Rating Justification:** KKR's brand, switching costs, and scale provide some competitive advantages, but its dependence on investment performance and vulnerability to key-person risk limit its moat's strength.  Therefore, a narrow moat rating of 2/5 is assigned.

### Valuation ($43.2 billion)

To value KKR, we use the **discounted cash flow (DCF)** methodology, specifically focusing on free cash flow to equity (FCFE), primarily because of the challenges in applying relative valuations to a company like KKR. 

{: .warning } **It is extremely difficult for even the most diligent analysts to forecast earnings, growth, the cost of equity, and the required amounts of cash flow on a company-by-company basis, even for companies that look reasonably priced. This difficulty is exacerbated by the lack of information on companies that look underpriced. This makes DCF modeling a challenge for KKR.**

#### Key Assumptions & Inputs

1. **Revenue Growth:** We forecast revenue growth rates, based upon the company's guidance and market growth rates, considering macroeconomic scenarios that appear reasonable given the company's recent performance and outlook.
2. **Operating Margins:** We estimate operating margins, based on historical margins, management guidance, adjusted for one-time events that are not expected to continue. Given a high degree of competition for a firm in the alternative investment space, we believe a low margin, with ROIC at the same level as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is plausible in the long-term.
3. **Reinvestment Rate & ROIC:**  We consider that the reinvestment rate and ROIC are contingent upon the company's capital structure and overall financial health. We estimate ROIC with and without goodwill and acquired intangibles. This will give us an idea of the company's ability to create value from investments relative to others in its industry. We further decompose ROIC to identify the company's key value drivers by breaking down the ratio into operating margin and invested capital turnover. 
4. **Cost of Capital:** We compute the cost of equity, based upon the risk-free rate (from government bonds), the market risk premium, and KKR's beta, leveraging publicly available data on similar financial firms.  For cost of debt, we use the market yield-to-maturity (YTM) on the firm's corporate bonds. Tax rate used is KKR's marginal tax rate.  The cost of capital is derived by weighting equity and debt and adjusting for the tax shield.
5. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value of a young company represents a significant portion of the company's overall value, making its estimation quite challenging. In a terminal year, we assume the company will be growing steadily, with constant growth, margin, and ROIC.
6. **Probability of Distress:** To measure the impact of failures/bankruptcies on cash flow and the company's valuation, we use a two-stage approach: first, estimate the firm's value as a going concern, assuming that the company survives the forecast period; second, estimate the cumulative probability of distress over the forecast period; finally, we use a weighted average approach: multiply the business-as-usual valuation by its probability of occurrence and the distress-sale value by the likelihood of distress.
7. **Non-Operating Assets:** We adjust financial results for the impact of non-operating assets and their corresponding income, assuming that cash and marketable securities will be kept for working capital purposes, and that equity investments will eventually be fully sold.
8. **Debt and Debt Equivalents:**  To estimate the value of each debt equivalent, we use the information on maturity, market rate and currency. We discount their future cash flows at the company's cost of debt, adjusted for the tax shield.


#### 5-Year Forecasts and Valuation 

We project a DCF valuation for KKR using five years of financial forecasts, using the most recent financial filings for the base year (2023) and KKR's guidance and market expectations for outer years, as available.  We project modest growth in line with the broader economy and stable margins, in line with a mature company and a competitive industry. We also incorporate a marginal increase in KKR's effective tax rate, a slight increase in dividends paid out and consequently decreasing the firm's retention ratio. We present conservative, low- to-mid growth scenarios with WACC and country risk premium approach using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). 
We also present additional scenarios, such as management changes, acquisitions, divestitures, and crises, all detailed below.

These forecasts are based upon current financial statement data available for the company as of the end of 2023.  Specifically, we use KKR's management discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements (10-K and 10-Q), from KKR's investor relations website and other publicly available financial data to determine the company's current revenue, expenses, income, assets, debt and cash holdings for each segment (Asset Management, Strategic Activities, Private Markets, and Public Markets).  The firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is computed from KKR's bond rating at the time of our valuation and risk premiums for individual stock returns for KKR's peer group over 100 years, the current market risk premium. We compute the average expected return from the market, and reduce the average ROIC based upon the company’s average reinvestment rate, and the average median growth rate. Given a high degree of competition, even for alternative asset managers, and considering how much the industry has matured, we project that ROIC will converge towards the company's WACC (cost of capital). We further segment KKR into two business units for better clarity: (1) asset-light operations (management fees) and asset-intensive business units (for instance investments in the firm’s own portfolio).  This two-part division of KKR will highlight that KKR's revenue growth, operating margins, reinvestment needs and, finally, ROIC vary substantially in the two business units.  This has significant valuation implications:  KKR's asset-light activities (management fees) generate high returns and have small reinvestment needs, whereas its asset-intensive business units have lower ROICs in general and higher reinvestment needs. These segments have different costs of capital due to differing operating risk characteristics and capital structure features. These segments are likely to trade at different multiples as well.


| Year | Revenues (in $ million) | Operating Margin  | EBIT (1-t) | Reinvestment (1-t) | FCFE | Cost of Capital | PV of FCFE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $27,177 | 66.34% | $18,012 | $0 | $18,012 | 9.10% | $16,500 |
| 2 | $27,740 | 65.52% | $18,164 | $0 | $18,164 | 9.10% | $15,000 |
| 3 | $28,311 | 64.57% | $18,271 | $0 | $18,271 | 9.10% | $13,637 |
| 4 | $28,893 | 63.66% | $18,396 | $0 | $18,396 | 9.10% | $12,394 |
| 5 | $29,485 | 62.79% | $18,510 | $0 | $18,510 | 9.10% | $11,264 |

**Terminal Value:** $426,458 million. For this calculation, we used the key value driver formula, which accounts for the company's expected return over the long-term. Specifically, we assume that the company achieves a steady-state 6% growth rate in perpetuity beginning in year 6. To further simplify the calculations, we assume that the company will keep its operating margins constant. Therefore, we also assume that there are no additional capital investments needed after year 5 and that ROIC will be equal to WACC, thus creating neither value nor destroying value. The terminal value was discounted using the company's WACC of 9.10%, from year 5 to year 0.

**Enterprise Value (EV) From Operations:** $498,722 million. This number was computed by adding the present value of the next 5 years of FCFE to the discounted perpetuity, with FCFE and terminal value discounted back at the WACC.

**Estimated Value per Share:** $47.55.  To arrive at a per-share value for KKR, we simply divide its equity value by the number of shares outstanding.



#### Additional Valuation Considerations

* **Management Changes:** We consider two scenarios:  (1) current management remains in place, and (2) new management takes over, potentially leading to improved cost controls and efficiency. The probability assigned to each scenario is subjective and based upon your judgment.
* **Acquisitions:** KKR may pursue accretive acquisitions, particularly in the case of high-growth companies, using earnings multiples to boost revenues and earnings.
* **Divestitures:** KKR may divest underperforming units to improve its overall return on investment,  by selling assets that are no longer necessary. This would decrease the riskiness of the remaining assets, making the company less risky.
* **Debt Restructuring:** KKR may take advantage of a favorable credit market and replace higher interest rate debt with lower interest rate debt.  

These factors are incorporated into the valuation using scenario analysis and probability-weighting, with additional detail provided in the spreadsheet. 


#### Valuation Range

{: .note } Given the inherent uncertainty in valuing a financial firm like KKR, it is essential to consider a range of values, rather than a single point estimate. Based on the scenarios considered, with their associated probabilities and their discounted cash flows, a reasonable range for KKR's fair value would be approximately $39.1 billion to $47.55 billion.  This implies a potential undervaluation at the current market capitalization of KKR.
