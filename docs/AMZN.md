# Amazon
{: .fs-9 }

{: .label .label-purple }

Moat: 3/5

{: .label .label-yellow }

Pessimistic value: $1.4 T

Amazon's dominance in online retail, cloud services (AWS), and its growing presence in advertising and other sectors make it a compelling company.  However, its overreliance on growth as its core narrative and an increasingly uncertain competitive landscape warrant caution and a more measured assessment of its moat.

**Business Overview and Discussion of Moat**

Amazon's business model is multi-faceted.  It operates as a retailer, a marketplace provider, a cloud service provider, an
advertising platform, and increasingly, a logistics company.  While each of these businesses holds some promise, it's
essential to examine the specific competitive advantages (or lack thereof) within each.

* **E-commerce:** While Amazon dominates online retail, its advantage is not as insurmountable as some believe. Competition from other large retailers (Walmart, Target) and specialty e-commerce players is intensifying.  Furthermore, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential antitrust actions pose a constant threat. Finally, consumer behavior is fickle, and there are no switching costs to going from an Amazon purchase to a purchase at a competing retailer's online store.

* **AWS:** AWS remains the leader in cloud services, and its scale and network effects give it a clear advantage in some areas.  However, competition is heating up, with Microsoft, Google, and other large technology companies investing heavily in the cloud space.  Growth rates are likely to slow, and pricing pressure is intense as industry structure evolves.

* **Advertising:** While Amazon's advertising business is still growing rapidly, its ability to compete with established advertising giants (Google, Meta) remains uncertain. Furthermore, regulatory changes related to data collection and online advertising could adversely affect both revenue and profit growth.

* **Other Businesses:** Amazon continues to invest in new businesses, from grocery delivery to healthcare to streaming services. Each of these businesses is in its early stages, faces significant competition, and operates with uncertain profit margins.  Its ability to monetize these businesses is an open question.

**Moat Rating Justification:**  Amazon's moat, based on the preceding discussion, deserves a rating of 3 out of 5. While it dominates in some segments, its network effect in e-commerce, while strong, is not enough of a barrier to entry. Similarly, AWS, despite its dominance in some areas, faces growing competition.  Overall, Amazon's competitive advantages seem neither strong enough to guarantee value creation nor certain to last long enough to be categorized as a wide moat.

**Valuation**

Valuing Amazon requires parsing the different businesses, incorporating the distinct revenue and cost drivers within each,
and making reasonable estimates of cash flows, growth, and risk into the future. While there are always scenarios where
the market price for Amazon is justified, those scenarios often necessitate extremely optimistic assumptions about
revenue growth and profit margins. 

Based on the financial statements provided, including the company's 2019 10-K, its more recent 2022 and 2023 filings, and incorporating revenue growth and margin assumptions from our discussion of the moat, I arrive at a value of
approximately $1.4 trillion for the company's operating assets. This valuation incorporates the following key
assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on our concerns about its competitive landscape, we assume a slower revenue growth rate of 7 percent for the first five years, and 3.5 percent thereafter.

* **Target Operating Margin:** Amazon's current operating margins, before COVID-related expenses, are around 10 percent. With an assumption that pretax operating margins converge on the median (not the average) for global retail companies over time, the target margin is set at 5%.  Consequently, operating margin is assumed to move from -22.56% (2022) to 5% in 2027. 

* **Sales to Capital Ratio:** We assume that the sales to capital ratio will converge on the global average for the retail industry, of 2.00, by 2027.

* **Tax rate:** Based on information in Amazon's latest SEC filings, we estimate an effective tax rate of approximately 21%.

* **Cost of capital:** We assume a cost of capital of 8% based on the information provided, including the
unlevered beta for the business (1.04), Amazon's cost of debt (4.78%), the proportion of debt
in its capital structure (10.4%), and an additional 3% premium for country risk. 

* **Terminal Value:** We assume a terminal growth rate of 2 percent in perpetuity and a stable
period return on capital of 8 percent.

* **Probability of failure:** We estimate a probability of failure of 0%.
