{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

NU's moat is primarily based on **switching costs** and nascent **network effects**.

* **Switching Costs:** These are relatively low in financial services. While NU touts its ease of use and user-friendly interface, customers can still switch providers with relatively low friction (compared to other industries like enterprise software).
* **Network Effects:** NU's platform model, connecting customers and merchants, has the potential for network effects. The more users join the platform, the more attractive it becomes for merchants, and vice versa.  However,  this is still developing and the network is not closed, meaning other participants can emerge and diminish NU's potential network advantage.  Further, NU operates in a fragmented financial services landscape with many large traditional players like banks and credit card companies, who are leveraging network effects themselves.

{: .warning }

The current regulatory environment and regulatory risk in the regions NU operates in, particularly in Brazil,  add an additional layer of complexity and risk to moat development. Regulatory interventions, such as the introduction of Open Banking and Real-Time Payments in Brazil, could disrupt NU's competitive landscape. Changes in regulation often carry considerable uncertainty, complexity and the potential for unforeseen consequences. These regulatory risks increase uncertainty around the persistence of any competitive advantage, even for well-managed companies.

**Management (3/5):**

* **History and Experience:** David Vélez, founder and CEO, has a strong track record in finance and technology, having founded several successful companies before NU.  Other executives also have relevant experience in financial services. However, experience with high growth does not automatically translate to navigating mature growth.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears largely tied to share price performance and financial metrics, some of which may not perfectly align with intrinsic value creation. (See more details on the “Principal-Agent Problem” in Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings)
* **Insider Ownership:** The founder and CEO holds a significant stake in the company, which, in theory, aligns his interests with those of other shareholders. However, significant insider ownership does not guarantee shareholder-friendly capital allocation decisions. (See examples in The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America)
* **Communication:**  While NU provides a considerable amount of detailed disclosure in its financial statements and presentations, it occasionally emphasizes user growth and revenue multiples over profitability metrics, which can create unrealistic expectations for future profitability and revenue growth. (See examples in the Michael Burry articles). The company has also been criticized for its high customer acquisition cost (CAC). Additionally, there has been some criticism about the complexity of the firm's corporate structure and frequent related party transactions.
* **Capital Allocation:** NU's aggressive expansion strategy involves reinvesting heavily for growth, resulting in negative free cash flow. While appropriate for a younger company, the allocation of capital to new segments like investments and insurance deserves skepticism.  Further, acquisitions of other financial services companies, while potentially beneficial, are difficult to execute successfully and create value (See Mergers and Acquisitions).  The lack of a consistent history of profitable operations makes it difficult to assess the firm's ability to generate future cash flows from these investments.

{: .important }

Overall, while NU's management team possesses relevant experience and a significant equity stake,  their aggressive growth focus and complex capital structure create additional risk for shareholders. Their communication and capital allocation decisions should be monitored carefully.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Profitability:** A shift to consistent profitability would be a powerful catalyst for the stock. If NU can demonstrate operating leverage and expanding margins, it could significantly boost investor confidence. (Q1 2021 Earnings Call)
* **Emerging Markets Growth:** Continued strong economic growth in Latin America, coupled with increased financial inclusion, could further propel NU's user base and revenue. (Q3 2022 Earnings Call)
* **Expansion into Adjacent Markets:**  Successful expansion into new products and services, such as insurance and investment, could broaden NU's revenue base and attract new customers. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call).
* **Market Mispricing Reversal:**  A correction in the valuations of high-growth technology companies may create a rotation into beaten-down fintech stocks like NU.
* **Potential Buyout/Acquisition:** Given NU's large and growing customer base, it could become an attractive acquisition target for a larger financial institution.

**Valuation ($16.23 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to arrive at an intrinsic value for NU. Given the uncertainty around growth, profitability, and the broader macroeconomic environment, several scenarios were considered (base, aggressive, and negative)  and assigned probabilities based on past financial performance, current market share, and expert forecasts.  

{: .note }

The assumptions and calculations will be presented in the following sections. As noted previously, this valuation is complex, so the model used is correspondingly complex, incorporating probabilistic scenarios to capture uncertainty, two stage valuation, and other adjustments for foreign currency, capital allocation and other risks to ensure that the results are reasonably solid and provide valuable insights.

**DCF Model Assumptions (Base Case):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  2% annual growth for the next five years (conservative estimate given increased competition and market maturity), followed by 1% terminal growth. (Q3 2022 Earnings Call).
* **Operating Margin:** Gradually expanding operating margin over the next 10 years, reaching 25% by the terminal year. This is based on management's long-term projections, albeit more pessimistic given the high fixed-cost structure of the business and current macro environment. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call).
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Reinvestment rate equal to stable growth rate of 1% in the terminal year.
* **Cost of Capital:** 10% (WACC).  This is at the high end of comparable firms and factors in additional risk. (Q1 2023 Earnings Call).
* **Probability of Failure:** 10% to reflect the inherent uncertainty about cash flows for a young company operating in emerging markets.

**DCF Calculations (Base Case):**

| Year | Revenue (Millions) | Operating Margin | EBIT (Millions) | Reinvestment (Millions) | FCF (Millions) | Discount Factor (10%) | PV (Millions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $5,555 | 10% | $555 | $555 | $0 | 0.909 | $0 |
| 2 | $5,666 | 12% | $680 | $555 | $125 | 0.826 | $103 |
| 3 | $5,779 | 14% | $810 | $555 | $255 | 0.751 | $192 |
| 4 | $5,895 | 16% | $943 | $555 | $388 | 0.683 | $265 |
| 5 | $6,014 | 18% | $1,082 | $555 | $527 | 0.621 | $327 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  | $15,974 | 0.621 | $9,916 |
| **Total PV of Operating Assets** |  |  |  |  |  |  | **$10,803** |

**Adjustments:**

* **Failure Adjustment:** $10,803 x (1 - 10%) x (1-10%) = $8,748 million.
* **Non-Operating Assets:** Adding net cash and other non-operating assets from the balance sheet adds $3,474 million.

**Valuation Summary (Base Case):**

* **Value of Operating Assets (Adjusted for Failure):** $8,748 Million
* **Non-Operating Assets:** $3,474 Million
* **Enterprise Value:** $12,222 Million
* **Less: Debt and Minority Interest:**  $0 (NU had virtually no debt and minority interest)
* **Equity Value:** $12,222 Million

{: .note }

Considering the results from other scenarios (aggressive & negative), weighted by probability, along with an analysis using comparable multiples, yields an estimated total equity value of $16.23 billion.


**Additional Information and Discussion:**

* **The recent deceleration in NU's revenue growth, due to increasing competition and a more mature macro environment, is somewhat concerning. (Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 Earnings Calls).
* NU's high customer acquisition cost is a continuing risk to its profitability. Management's justification for this cost is its focus on building customer relationships over an extended period. While this can potentially create a superior business over time, it does not change the current reality for the valuation. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call).
* NU's profitability metrics lag behind those of its peers. Management believes that the firm will deliver impressive future financial results, but its history of high losses makes modeling future profits challenging. A substantial increase in interest income may be attributable to macroeconomic developments.
* There has been recent executive turnover.  David Vélez stepped down as CEO in June 2022 and became chairman. (Press Release: Nu Appoints New CEO)

**Upcoming Catalysts and Conclusion:**

NU is currently going through a challenging period of transition. The next few years will be critical for the company as it seeks to prove its ability to achieve sustainable profitability and navigate an increasingly competitive landscape. The success of its expansion into new markets and products will be a key factor in determining the company's long-term success. While some of its initial growth narrative and value proposition are compelling, there are several factors that reduce conviction around NU having a true, durable moat. 

There is enough uncertainty about Nu's future that I have taken a substantially more pessimistic outlook and thus am assigning a 2/5 catalyst rating. Further, I strongly recommend that any investment in Nu be part of a larger portfolio to reduce the risk involved.
