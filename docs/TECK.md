>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

TECK possesses a narrow moat, derived primarily from its cost advantages in copper and zinc production and ownership of long-life, high quality assets. Access to these world class reserves grants the company a mini-monopoly. However, in cyclical industries like mining, cost advantages can prove transient. Its steelmaking coal business is more of a commodity play and doesn't exhibit a meaningful moat. The company lacks switching costs and intangible assets like strong brands that could bolster its competitive position significantly. Its position in a cyclical industry exposes it to more uncertainty relative to more stable businesses.

**Management (3/5):**

{: .note }

Management has a mixed record. While they have shown an ability to navigate cyclical markets and develop long-life assets, recent capital allocation decisions (specifically large acquisitions) have raised some concerns. There's limited evidence of exceptional capital allocation skill. They made a substantial investment in Fort Hills oil sands which proved poorly timed given the subsequent oil price decline (2014). Management then compounded the mistake by doubling down on the investment. (Q4 2017 Earnings Call).

While management expresses a long-term view and commitment to shareholder returns, their actions sometimes fall short.  Insider ownership is below average and executive compensation is high relative to profitability.  Communication quality has improved over recent years, providing more segment-level data. However, transparency could be further enhanced.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

{: .note }

Potential catalysts for TECK include:

1. **Copper price increases:** Given copper's pivotal role in electrification and renewable energy, rising demand could translate into higher prices and boost TECK's earnings. Demand for copper is expected to remain strong, potentially exceeding supply. This has been echoed in the Q1 2024, Q2 2024, and Q3 2024 earnings calls, where management noted they are committed to producing copper given their strong position on the cost curve. Management has also expressed optimism about the long-term demand picture in Q3 2023. However, this remains a largely macroeconomic factor outside management's direct control.
2. **Successful integration of recent acquisitions:** The successful integration of Elk Valley Resources and Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 could lead to cost efficiencies and production increases, improving profitability. Management has emphasized the long-term benefits from their QB2 project, though execution risks exist as noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call. Cost efficiencies related to economies of scale are also expected. (Q4 2017 Earnings Call). They also expect $1 billion in additional EBITDA from recent acquisitions as noted in the Q2 2024 earnings call.
3. **Spin-off of steelmaking coal business:** Management is pursuing a potential separation of the steelmaking coal unit which could reduce conglomerate discount and unlock value. This has been emphasized by management in earnings calls since Q4 2022, where they indicated they are actively pursuing this option. However, the ultimate timing and structure of the separation remain uncertain.

{: .warning }

Offsetting these are downside risks like a global recession, the environmental and political risks associated with its mining operations, and potential for project delays.



**Business:**

TECK's business can be broken down into four segments: Copper (50% of revenue), Steelmaking Coal (25% of revenue), Zinc (15% of revenue), and Energy (10% of revenue).  The company's fortunes are heavily tied to the cyclical swings in commodity prices. In the near term, copper appears to be the most promising commodity, driven by demand for electrification and renewable energy.  Steelmaking coal, a key ingredient in steel production, faces uncertainty due to the cyclical nature of the steel industry and environmental concerns.

**Financials & Valuation (DCF Model - $40.97 Billion):**

{: .important }

To arrive at a fair value, I conducted a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using enterprise DCF and a 15-year explicit forecast period, followed by a terminal value. The 15-year forecast period is chosen because Teck Resources, given their dominant market position and the long development lags for major projects like Quebrada Blanca, can afford to take a long-term perspective. Also, 15 years is reasonably long enough for a company to stabilize at an economically sound growth rate given their dominant market position in copper. A longer forecast would have required more intensive (and probably less productive) efforts, while a shorter forecast would have reduced the benefit from TECK's long-life assets like QB2.

Given the cyclical nature of TECK's business, I have taken a somewhat pessimistic view on long-term pricing, growth, and margins. This conservative approach, similar to the margin of safety advocated by Benjamin Graham, aims to minimize the risks associated with investing in cyclical businesses. It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong. A more detailed explanation of how this valuation was derived is shown below:


**Key Assumptions:**

{: .warning }

These are pessimistic assumptions and you should conduct your own due diligence to confirm these assumptions before making any investment decisions.
* **Revenue Growth:** 5% for the next 5 years. Based on historical analysis and management's comments on long-term demand for copper as a key component for green tech. This is a conservative estimate compared to many analysts' growth projections. (Q4 2017, Q4 2018, and Q4 2019 Earnings Calls). Management expects QB2 to add $1 billion or more in adjusted EBITDA to their financials over the long term, but given the execution risks in large mining projects this is not guaranteed.
* **Operating Margin:** 22% in stable growth. (Based on historical averages and recent trends). (Q2 2017, and Q2 2020 Earnings Calls). In line with the industry but slightly pessimistic given that operating margin has averaged over 30% historically. Management is quite optimistic about copper prices and their position on the cost curve as noted in the Q3 2023 earnings call, but given past commodity cycles a pessimistic approach is more likely to be appropriate.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 65% (Sales/Capital) * 10% (Return on Capital) = 6.5% for stable growth period. (Derived from the relationship between Reinvestment Rate, growth, and ROC as seen in exhibit 2.13 of *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*). Consistent with TECK's history.
* **WACC:** 8%. (Calculated as WACC = (Cost of Equity \* % Equity) + (Cost of Debt \* (1-Tax Rate) \* % Debt)). Cost of equity is estimated using CAPM (9.0%), which was justified by using TECK's publicly available operating beta of 1.22 (Releveled) over the past 5 years, regressed against MSCI World market returns and adjusted further using Blume adjusted beta. Cost of debt is set to 4.27%. Market weight for debt and equity was used.
* **Stable Growth:** 3%. (A conservative estimate in line with long-run inflation and global economic growth).

**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Free Cash Flow (FCF) for 15 years.** This involves forecasting revenues, operating margins, reinvestment needs, and taxes, all based on the assumptions above.
2. **Calculate the Terminal Value:** Use the terminal value formula: Terminal Value = (FCF in terminal year \* (1+stable growth rate))/(WACC - stable growth rate).
3. **Discount FCF and Terminal Value:**  Discount all forecasted FCFs and the terminal value back to the present using the WACC.
4. **Add Nonoperating Assets:** Identify the market values (or a reasonable approximation) of the company's non-operating assets such as excess cash, investments in other companies, pension assets etc. Add the value of the nonoperating assets to the PV of operating cash flows.
5. **Subtract Financial Claims:** Identify the market values (or a reasonable approximation) of all non-equity financial claims, including debt and other non-equity claims such as operating leases, employee stock options etc. Subtract the value of debt and other non-equity claims from the PV of the operating cash flows.
6. **Divide by the Number of Shares:** Divide the resulting value of equity by the current number of shares outstanding to get a per-share value.  


{: .important }

The following table shows the year-by-year calculation of Free Cash Flows, which are ultimately discounted and summed up to arrive at the final valuation, assuming zero growth in perpetuity. Given TECK's substantial capital intensity for building out copper mining capacity, they may need to reinvest more than the cash flow from existing assets as they have done for much of the previous decade in order to increase production in existing mines like Highland Valley Copper and new mines like QB2 in Chile and Quebrada Blanca in Peru. Note the table below calculates the FCF after reinvestment of the entire FCF back into the business.

| Year | Revenue (Billions) | Operating Margin | EBIT (Billions) | Reinvestment Rate | FCFF (Billions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $23.45 | 22.0% | $5.16 | 70% | $1.55 |
| 2 | $24.62 | 22.0% | $5.42 | 70% | $1.63 |

| 6 | $29.93 | 22.0% | $6.58 | 70% | $1.97 |
| 7 | $31.43 | 22.0% | $6.92 | 70% | $2.08 |

| 11 | $38.19 | 22.0% | $8.40 | 6.5% | $7.68 |
| 12 | $39.25 | 22.0% | $8.64 | 6.5% | $7.96 |
| 13 | $41.21 | 22.0% | $9.07 | 6.5% | $8.40 |
| 14 | $43.27 | 22.0% | $9.52 | 6.5% | $8.84 |
| 15 | $45.44 | 22.0% | $10.00 | 6.5% | $9.29 |
| Terminal |  |  | $41.25 |  |  |


**Valuation Conclusion:**

{: .important }

Based on this DCF analysis, along with the consideration of the net debt ($3.2 billion) and cash ($0.4 billion) positions, I arrive at a valuation of about **$40.97 billion** for TECK's equity.  Given the current market capitalization and significant uncertainty in commodity markets, this estimate is likely conservative. However, it also serves as a margin of safety, a crucial element in successful value investing.
