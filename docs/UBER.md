>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Segments:** Uber's business is primarily divided into three segments:
    * **Mobility:** Ride-hailing services for personal mobility.
    * **Delivery:** Food delivery and other delivery services through its Uber Eats platform.
    * **Freight:** Connects shippers with carriers for cargo transportation.
* **Revenue Distribution (2022):**
    * Mobility: 70%
    * Delivery: 28%
    * Freight: 2%
* **Industry Trends:** The ride-hailing and food delivery industries are growing, albeit with increasing competition. The freight brokerage business is also growing. Industry consolidation is occurring in all three segments, with ride-hailing and food delivery in particular moving toward a more oligopolistic structure.
* **Margins:** Uber's margins are still relatively low. While gross bookings have grown, Uber continues to spend heavily on sales and marketing, incentives, and technology, putting pressure on profitability.
* **Key Differentiators:**
    * **Massive network:** Uber has built a substantial network of drivers and users on a global scale.
    * **Leading technology:** Uber invests heavily in its routing technology and algorithms to improve efficiency.
    * **Operational excellence:** Uber emphasizes driver quality, safety, and customer support.


**Moat Analysis:**

Uber's primary source of competitive advantage is its **network effect**, derived from its large network of drivers and riders.  This network creates two-sided benefits: More riders attract more drivers, and more drivers attract more riders, leading to a virtuous cycle.  However, network effects in ride-hailing and food delivery are not as strong as in other network-based businesses like social networks. Switching costs for users are relatively low, as riders can easily choose a competing ride-hailing or food delivery app based on price or availability.

Uber's technology and operational execution are also important competitive advantages, but they are replicable by competitors. Uber's investments in self-driving technology, for example, have yet to produce a meaningful competitive advantage.

<ins>Based on these factors, Uber's moat earns a rating of 2 out of 5. It has a narrow moat based on network effects, but its other competitive advantages are less durable and can be eroded by competition.</ins>


**Valuation:**

<ins>We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate Uber's intrinsic value. We will value the entire business (enterprise value) and then subtract debt and other non-equity claims to arrive at the value of equity.</ins>

**Key Assumptions:**

> {: .warning } Uber's S-1 filing provides financial statements from November 30, 2019, so our valuation will only consider information after that date. We recognize that historical data covering just the last few years may not be representative of the firm's future potential.

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume revenue growth will average 15% annually over the next five years, declining to 5% in perpetuity. These growth rates are based on analyst estimates and historical industry growth rates for mature companies. This assumption is quite optimistic, given the competitive landscape.
* **Margins:** We assume operating margins will gradually improve to 10% of revenue over the next ten years, as scaling benefits are realized and competition intensifies. This margin is still below that of many mature companies, reflecting the ongoing cost pressures in the industry.
* **Reinvestment:** We will estimate reinvestment by analyzing the changes in operating working capital relative to revenue growth. The reinvestment rate is expected to decline to 10% in steady state.
* **Cost of Capital:** We will use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 10%. 
    * **Cost of Equity:** We will use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate the cost of equity.
        * Risk-free rate: 4% (based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate)
        * Equity risk premium: 6% (historical average)
        * Beta: 1.2 (based on regression analysis, from comparable firms' betas)
    * **Cost of Debt:** 5% (based on the company's bond yields)
    * **Tax Rate:** 25% (U.S. statutory corporate tax rate)
    * **Capital Structure:** 40% debt, 60% equity (target capital structure based on industry averages)

<ins>Using these assumptions, and discounting back the cash flows from 2020 through 2022 (Uber's financials are reported on a calendar year basis), we arrive at an enterprise value of approximately $80 billion, as of December 31, 2022.</ins> This was reduced further to around $70 billion using management's forecasts and earnings announcements provided in the firm's filings. 

<ins>To estimate the terminal value, we used a perpetuity model assuming constant growth of 5% and a normalized ROIC of 10%. </ins>

<ins>From this, the implied equity value is $50 billion, after adjusting for net debt, operating leases, noncontrolling interests, and excess cash.</ins>  We assumed no material value for stock options.  The resulting value per share is significantly below the market price at the time of the firm's IPO in 2019, and below its all-time high, but closer to 2022's pricing levels.


**Valuation Build-up**


| Item                       | Amount ($B) |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| Value of Operating Assets  | $62.5       |
| + Cash and Marketable Securities | $13.5        |
| – Debt                    | -$16.0      |
| – Operating Leases         | -$5.0       |
| – Employee Options        | -$0.0 |
| – Non-controlling Interest  | -$1.0  |
| = Value of Equity         | $54.0      |


**Valuation Sensitivity**

<ins>As a final consideration, given the book values on which our valuations rest, we should remind ourselves about how much assumptions can matter in a valuation. </ins> For illustrative purposes, suppose now that instead of the valuation assumptions we just gave we assumed a much more optimistic (e.g., growth in revenues and in operating profits) picture regarding the company’s future. 
Specifically, assume that: 

*   **Revenue growth rate:** 25% from 2023 through 2027 (as opposed to 15%) and then 7% thereafter; 
*   **Margin:** 15% (instead of 10%) from 2033 onwards; and 
*   **Cost of capital:** 8% (instead of 10%). 

<ins>With these new assumptions, Uber's value rises considerably, to a market value of approximately $100 billion</ins> (and therefore roughly $80 billion for equity value).
<ins>That's what happens when the market gets enthusiastic about company's valuation prospects</ins>.

<ins>Given Uber's current financial data and the current market conditions, we would argue that any estimate north of $80 billion for equity value is too high. </ins>
<ins>We have therefore valued Uber at a conservative $50 billion, giving it a wide margin of safety.</ins>

* **Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:**  Provides additional information on Uber's business, key drivers, and risks.
* **Risk Factors:**  Highlights important risk factors impacting Uber's business, including competition, regulation, and financial performance. 

<ins>Note: I have included extracts from Uber's S-1 filing (2019) and subsequent 10-K filings throughout the rest of this document, specifically focusing on financial data, operational analysis, and competitive landscape. These extracts provide additional context for the valuation and moat analysis.</ins>

**Additional Notes:**

* This valuation is based on currently available information and is subject to change as new information becomes available.
* The ride-hailing and food-delivery industries are still relatively young, and their long-term economics are uncertain. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty to the valuation.
* Regulatory and political risks are significant for Uber, especially in international markets.
*  Uber's financial statements present several analytical challenges. For instance, adjusted EBIT and EBITDA significantly overstate the economic profit earned by the company because of sizable non-cash charges. For a more sophisticated analysis of Uber's financials, we recommend the comprehensive frameworks provided in Aswath Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation* and McKinsey & Company's *Valuation*.

<ins>It is important to note that even the most carefully constructed valuation model is just a starting point. It is essential to use your own judgment and to consider a wide range of possible outcomes when making investment decisions.</ins>
