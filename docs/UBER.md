Uber operates a dual-sided platform business. Its two main segments are Mobility (ride-hailing) and Delivery (food and other delivery services).  The network effects inherent in such a model create a modest moat.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Uber benefits from network effects.  More riders attract more drivers, which in turn attracts more riders. This positive feedback loop creates a barrier to entry, as a new entrant would need a critical mass of both riders and drivers to successfully compete.  However, network effects can erode.

>  "When network effects do break down it is only because what once was a private or public service has become subject to successful threats from outside the network." (Valuation)

Uber's network, while not as closed as some financial exchanges, is still more limited than those of companies that deal in physical goods. Network strength has decreased as driver churn has increased. It's also easier to create substitute networks in this setting than in other network-effect businesses with higher switching costs. Moreover, there are a lot of competitor, especially in the near-term, blurring using this moat.

**Management (3/5):**

* **History & Experience:** Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO since 2017, has significant experience in the travel and e-commerce sectors, having previously led Expedia.
* **Communication & Transparency:**  Uber provides detailed segment information and regularly participates in earnings calls, offering some transparency. However, the shift from GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for presenting financial results reduces clarity.

> "Many managers focus on managing earnings rather than shareholder value.  ...They are tempted to manage earnings by smoothing earnings, playing games with accounting treatments, ..." (Valuation)

* **Capital Allocation:** Capital allocation decisions have been mixed. The strategic expansion into freight is still being evaluated. There have been significant investments in new technologies (autonomous driving, for instance), which haven't yet translated into consistent profits, making the assessment of capital allocation challenging. Moreover, many private businesses exited the U.S. market during the 1973–1974 recession to avoid capital losses, whereas Uber doubled down, an indication of questionable judgment.

> "We did not anticipate the duration and depth of the COVID-19 pandemic." - Dara Khosrowshahi (Q2 2020 Earnings Call)

* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is substantial but largely tied to share price performance.
* **Insider Ownership:**  There is some insider ownership but not substantial enough to fully align management with shareholder interests.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Continued Growth in Delivery:** The Delivery segment continues to grow and expand geographically.

{: .note }

> "Over time, we are increasingly bullish on our Delivery opportunity." - Nelson Chai, CFO (Q3 2021 Earnings Call)

* **Improving Profitability:**  Uber is increasingly focused on profitability, both through cost cutting and price increases.

{: .note }

> "Our business model is actually quite profitable." - Dara Khosrowshahi (Q1 2023 Earnings Call)

* **Autonomous Driving:**  Investments in autonomous driving technology have the potential to disrupt the industry, though the timeline for widespread adoption remains uncertain.

{: .note }

> "While autonomous vehicle technology is progressing nicely..." - Dara Khosrowshahi (Q4 2022 Earnings Call)

* **Expansion into New Markets:** Uber continues to explore new markets and services, such as grocery and package delivery.

> "We are expanding beyond ride hailing..." - Dara Khosrowshahi (Q2 2021 Earnings Call)

**Valuation ($47.5 billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was performed using the following assumptions (derived from Uber's annual reports, earnings calls, and other publicly available information for 2019 to 2022, incorporating COVID-19 impacts for 2020-2021):

* **Revenue Growth:** Declining initially by 10% due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, but gradually recovering, reflecting market consensus and management guidance.
* **Operating Margin:**  Assuming a gradual improvement over the next five years, towards a more conservative 15% EBIT margin (earnings before interest and taxes).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Estimated based on sales growth forecasts and historical reinvestment patterns.
* **Cost of Capital:** Estimated based on a conservative beta of 1.2, a risk-free rate of 3%, and an equity risk premium of 5%, reflecting the increased risk of investing in a tech platform.
* **Terminal Value:** Estimated by assuming modest long-term growth of 3%, slightly higher than the long-run inflation rate.

{: .warning }

> "We are not necessarily saying that these rates will in fact materialize" - Uber's 2020 SEC 10K Filing

The assumptions yield an estimated terminal value of $55 billion, which was then discounted along with expected annual cash flows over ten years to derive an enterprise value of approximately $61 billion.  Subtracting debt and adding back cash leads to an equity value of $47.5 billion.

**Business:**

Uber's revenues primarily come from ride hailing (Mobility) and food and other delivery services (Delivery). Growth, especially in the delivery business, has fueled Uber's expansion. However, profitability has been elusive, and the company faces intense competition in both segments. Uber differs from its competitors in its scale, its global reach, and its innovative business model of enabling ride-hailing and delivery by leveraging individual vehicle ownership and a smart-phone app, although it has become a mature firm.

**Financials:**

Uber's financials reflect its high-growth/loss-making history, though profitability has improved in recent years.  As of Q2 2023, Uber reported revenues of $9.23 billion and positive net income of $392 million. The company’s financial statements are available in their SEC filings.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* **Regulatory Scrutiny:**  Uber has faced and continues to face regulatory challenges around the world, impacting its operations and profitability.

{: .note }

> "We are subject to a number of investigations..." (Q2 2023 10K filing)

* **Driver Classification:**  The classification of drivers as independent contractors versus employees is an ongoing legal battle that affects Uber’s cost structure and labor relations.

{: .note }

> "Driver classification continues to be a critical issue..." (Q3 2021 Earnings Call)

* **Competition:** Uber faces competition from other ride-hailing companies like Lyft, as well as from taxi services and public transportation. In the food delivery space, competition comes from DoorDash, Grubhub, and other companies.

This valuation and assessment are based on available information and reflect a conservative and pessimistic view.  The future performance of Uber, as with any company, depends on a variety of unpredictable factors.  Even if management executes its plan flawlessly, unforeseen events can impact the firm. As Benjamin Graham emphasizes, an average is better than a single number when assessing risk. Therefore, an investor needs to be realistic about the probability of different outcomes.
