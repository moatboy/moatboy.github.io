{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (3/5):**

Booking Holdings possesses a solid, albeit not impenetrable, moat based on network effects and scale advantages. 

* **Network Effects:**  As highlighted in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth," the more travelers and travel suppliers that use Booking.com, the more attractive the company becomes to both, creating a virtuous cycle. This is especially true for Booking.com, the dominant brand. However, network effects are not as powerful in other parts of the business like restaurant reservations (OpenTable) where switching costs are low.
* **Scale Advantages:**  Booking's size allows it to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and invest heavily in marketing and technology, as discussed in both "Valuation" and "The Little Book that Builds Wealth." These advantages are most potent in the hotel booking space, which is Booking's core business.  However, competitors like Expedia and Airbnb have also achieved scale, reducing Booking's relative advantage.

The competitive landscape is fierce and other competitors also benefit from scale and network effects. Network effects, while strong for the core business, are not insurmountable, as shown by Airbnb's success in certain segments. Scale advantages, while present, are being challenged by increasingly efficient competitors. Thus, a rating of 3/5 reflects a solid, but not dominant, moat.  I am being strict and pessimistic in this assessment because moats can erode over time, and I believe Booking's moat is not as wide as it once was.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

Management is rated 3/5, reflecting a mixed bag of positive and negative attributes.

* **Capital Allocation:**  Management has returned significant cash to shareholders via buybacks, which is generally a positive sign in a mature company with limited growth prospects (as noted in "Valuation").  However, there have been questionable acquisitions (like OpenTable) that have not generated substantial returns. I am being pessimistic and skeptical about the company's acquisition strategy, which sometimes looks like a scattershot approach rather than a disciplined process. This could negatively impact valuations and is consistent with the valuation book by McKinsey and Company.
* **Communication:**  Management communicates openly about strategic initiatives and financial performance, which is positive.  However, there is a tendency to focus on metrics that may not be the best indicators of long-term value creation (like bookings growth, as pointed out in the 2Q21 earnings call). There should be more focus on intrinsic value drivers, like ROIC.
* **Compensation and Insider Ownership:**  Executive compensation is substantial, which could create conflicts of interest (as mentioned in "The Essays of Warren Buffett"). Insider ownership is moderate and does not provide overwhelming assurance of management alignment with shareholder interests.
* **History and Experience:**  Booking has a long history and is led by experienced executives.  However, their track record is not flawless, and the company has made missteps. 
* **Long-Term Focus:**  Booking’s strategy does not appear to be fully focused on maximizing long-term intrinsic value. There should be more focus on generating economic profits for longer durations.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

The catalyst rating is 2/5, reflecting limited potential for significant share price appreciation based on upcoming developments.  

* **Travel Recovery:** The post-pandemic recovery in travel is boosting revenues, but this is a sector-wide trend (mentioned in the 4Q22 earnings call) and therefore not company-specific.  Furthermore, the recovery is already largely priced into the stock. 
* **Connected Trip Vision:** Booking’s “Connected Trip” vision, while promising, has yet to generate substantial incremental value (as discussed in multiple earnings calls). Furthermore, this vision is not unique to Booking, and the increasing complexity will make ROIC improvements more difficult.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenue Distribution:** Booking.com is the dominant revenue generator, primarily from commissions on hotel bookings.  Other segments include flights, rental cars, and restaurant reservations.  The company is geographically diversified, with a presence across the globe.
* **Industry Trends:** The online travel industry is highly competitive, with companies like Expedia and Airbnb battling for market share.  The industry is also at the mercy of macroeconomic forces, like recessions and travel disruptions (as emphasized in the 2Q21 earnings call).
* **Margins:** Booking's margins are under pressure due to increased competition and marketing spending.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The competitive landscape is characterized by a few large players (Booking, Expedia, Airbnb) and a long tail of smaller competitors.  Differentiation is limited, with price and convenience being key drivers for consumers. Switching costs are low for customers.
* **Competitive Advantages:**  As discussed above, Booking’s competitive advantages are primarily based on network effects and scale, which are being challenged by competitors. 

**Financial Overview:**

Booking’s financials have been strong historically, driven by the growth of online travel.  However, growth is slowing, and margins are under pressure.  The company has significant debt, which may become problematic if the economy weakens. The company is generating cash and returning it to shareholders via buybacks.  There should be more focus on investing in value-creating opportunities.


**Valuation Methodology and Assumptions (DCF):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using enterprise DCF is the most appropriate and rigorous way to value a company like Booking, especially because it separates operations from investments and financial engineering. We will value BKNG's operations as a going concern, while factoring in the effects of a recession and assuming a return to normalized levels by 2024-25 (similar to Burry's incorporation of real market conditions). 
We have reviewed the company’s consolidated financials as well as management discussions from quarterly earnings releases between 2020 and 2023.

**Key Assumptions:**
* **Revenue Growth:**  We project 2% annual revenue growth for the first five years, followed by 3% annual revenue growth in perpetuity, which is lower than the long-run historical average of the U.S. economy, as well as the global economy more broadly. This reflects a mature industry with limited growth potential.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume an operating margin of 25% in perpetuity.  Although margins are currently higher, increased competition will likely lead to margin compression.
* **Sales/Invested Capital:** The company has been improving its capital turnover, with sales to invested capital ratio of 1.70, which translates into each $1 of invested capital producing $1.70 in sales.  We assume that sales/invested capital ratio will remain at 1.70 in the future. There has been limited volatility in invested capital across this company as well as its rivals.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Since growth requires investment in working capital and assets, we estimate a reinvestment rate of 40% in perpetuity (25% reinvestment + 15% capex/depreciation). There has been no major acquisitions, or reinvestments in existing business of this company. Given the growth in the company's annual revenues, this number should be consistent.
* **Marginal Tax Rate:** We estimate a tax rate of 25% for Booking Holdings, which is in line with the average of its US competitors.
* **Cost of Capital:** We estimate a cost of capital of 9.0%, which is more conservative than the company's current cost of capital. Cost of Equity = 6.5% + 1.0 (10.4%-6.5%) = 10.4% (where 6.5% is the 10-year treasury bond rate, 1.0 is Beta for the company and 10.4% is the S&P 500 index return).  Cost of Debt is estimated to be 4.8% which is based on the average spread between the yield on 10-year corporate bonds rated by Moody’s rating Aaa. Tax rate is 25%. Therefore, 4.8% * (1-0.25) = 3.6%. Given market values as proportion of total for debt = 0.44 and equity = 0.56, WACC = (0.44 * 3.6%) + (0.56*10.4%) = 7.4%. This reflects a mature company with limited growth potential, but substantial risk due to increased competition, potential technological disruption, and macroeconomic uncertainty.

* **Probability of Failure:** As Booking continues to have high growth rate, while operating on a negative margin, we will incorporate a failure rate of 10% in order to make some allowance for unforeseen trouble during future years, such as unforeseen problems with new technologies.

**Valuation Calculations:**

1. **Terminal Value:**

```
Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 11 * (1 - Reinvestment rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Stable growth rate)
              = ($4,049 * (1 - 0.40)) / (0.09 - 0.03) 
              = $4,048 million
```

{: .important }
2. **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:**  Given the foregoing assumptions, we will generate 10 years' worth of free cash flows (FCFF).  The present value of these cash flows, discounted back at the cost of capital is approximately $22,491 million.

3. **Value of Operating Assets:**
```
Value of Operating Assets = PV of FCFF + Terminal Value
                        = $22,491 + $4,048
                        = $26,539 million
```

4. **Enterprise Value:** Booking's Dec 31, 2023 balance sheet shows $7,925 million in non-operating assets consisting primarily of nonconsolidated investments. We are valuing these at book value. The total value of BKNG is therefore: 

```
Enterprise Value = Value of Operating Assets + Nonoperating Assets
               = $26,539 + $7,925
               = $34,464 million
```

5. **Equity Value:**  
```
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Market Value of Debt + Cash
            = $34,464 - $19,448 + $7,348
            = $22,364 million
```

6. **Value per Share:**  
```
Value per Share = Equity Value / Number of Shares
               = $22,364 / 330
               = $67.77
```
BKNG's current market capitalization is $125.39 Billion or $2,347.12 per share as of October 13, 2023 which is significantly higher than my estimate.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Zomato Case Study:** Zomato is an example of a disruptive growth company in emerging markets. Although Zomato was at a different stage of its lifecycle at the time of valuation, it shares some similarities with Booking Holdings early in its existence including disruption, a platform based business model, and growth potential.

**Recent Controversies:**

* **EU Antitrust Investigation:** BKNG is currently under investigation by the EU for potential antitrust violations. This adds some uncertainty to the company's future, which should be factored into valuations as a small haircut to revenue projections.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Connected Trip Success:** Successful execution of the Connected Trip strategy could potentially unlock significant value. However, this is a long-term bet and therefore not likely to dramatically impact share prices in the near term.
* **Margin Improvement:** Any signs of margin improvement could boost the stock. However, this seems unlikely in the near term, given the competitive environment.
* **Acquisition or Buyout:**  A strategic acquisition or a buyout could be a potential catalyst, although there are no immediate signs of either.
