>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:**  Booking.com is the dominant revenue driver, contributing approximately 85% of total revenues. The remaining revenues come primarily from agency, merchant, advertising, and other services related to accommodation reservations on their various platforms. Revenue is generated globally with a strong presence in the US and Europe, followed by Asia and other regions.
* **Industry Trends:** The online travel industry has become highly competitive. Significant industry consolidation has occurred through mergers and acquisitions over the past two decades. There is an increasing shift in customer behavior, towards direct reservations, as well as a gradual and sustained shift away from hotels towards alternative accommodations. This structural shift is driven, in large part, by the online reservation platforms themselves. This structural shift represents a tailwind for BKNG in the long-term.
* **Margins:** The online travel agency industry is characterized by high operating leverage and volatile profit margins. BKNG's operating margins are currently around 31%, but historical data reveals fluctuations from 14% to 35%. These margins are lower than those of some of its competitors. The company's sales-to-capital ratio is 1.8, which implies that for every dollar of revenue, it needs an additional $0.56 of invested capital, demonstrating significant investment requirements. Although Booking's ROIC is above average at 14%, it still significantly lower than some of its high ROIC peers, such as Microsoft and Moody's.
* **Competitive Advantages:**  Network effects are BKNG's most significant competitive advantage, particularly Booking.com's leadership position in accommodations. Brand name, economies of scale and scope, and switching costs play an important but subordinate role as the main moat source. The company has achieved a substantial position in the accommodations segment, but smaller in airline ticketing and rental cars. It is also important to note that the company has negative ROIC in its new businesses and several of those new businesses have been operating for an extended period, indicating the company does not yet have a sustainable formula for making money in some of its non-core businesses. Moreover, the online travel agency sector has very low barriers to entry, with an increasing number of companies offering similar products and services.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

A rating of 3 out of 5 reflects a narrow moat based on BKNG's position in the online travel industry with its current competitive advantages:

* **Network Effects (Strong):**  Booking.com boasts the largest selection of accommodations globally, creating a virtuous cycle where more accommodations attract more customers and vice versa.  A competing site would find it extremely challenging to replicate this network. 
* **Brand Name (Moderate):** BKNG enjoys good brand recognition and recall across its brands, but brand strength is not as powerful as in some consumer industries. Given the increasing trend towards direct booking, brand plays an important but subordinate role in creating and enhancing competitive advantage.
* **Economies of Scale and Scope (Moderate):** BKNG benefits from规模经济和范围经济across its platforms, allowing it to spread fixed costs (technology, advertising) over a larger revenue base. Given the industry's high operating leverage, the impact of economies of scale is less than what it would be for a traditional manufacturing company. As the online travel market scales, there are declining marginal benefits from scale, implying increased competition.
* **Switching Costs (Weak):** Switching costs for consumers using online travel agents are generally low, making it relatively easy to compare prices and switch platforms. Customers are more sensitive to price when choosing an online travel agent. For frequent travelers, there is a weak switching cost, which might manifest itself only in the loyalty programs available at some online platforms. However, for the vast majority of occasional travelers, price is all that matters, and switching costs are minimal. Moreover, switching costs stemming from data integration are only available for business customers, but they are not powerful enough.

**Valuation:**

The valuation uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach with pessimistic assumptions:

1. **Forecast Period:** 10 years, in line with recommended practice for mature businesses with some growth potential.
2. **Revenue Growth:**  Starting from 15% in 2024, we assume revenue growth to decrease gradually over the next 10 years to 3% in stable growth. The online travel market is expected to grow by an average of about 10.5% per year for the 2023-33 period. The global penetration of online travel booking has increased steadily but online travel booking platforms still represent only 33% of gross travel bookings. This gives the industry room to grow over the next 10 years and more.
3. **Operating Margin:** We assume a slight improvement in the first few years from its current 31% level to 35% in the stable period, given the company's ability to cut costs, rationalize spending, and increase efficiency in operations.  This is lower than competitors and reflects competitive pressures.
4. **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on a stable-growth reinvestment rate of 30%, as computed earlier, and an expected growth rate of 3% in perpetuity. This assumption suggests a continuing commitment to growth despite the relatively mature status of the online travel booking industry.
5. **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 9% WACC was computed by using the weighted-average cost of capital framework, with a risk-free rate of 4.6%, a market risk premium of 5.5%, and an unlevered cost of equity 10.6%. Assuming Booking is fairly rated by the market today, this cost of capital will be a good proxy for long-term return on equity.
6. **Terminal Value:** We used the continuing-value method, calculated earlier, where the continuing value equals after-tax operating income in the final year multiplied by 1-reinvestment rate and divided by (cost of capital – stable growth rate). Terminal year is year 10.


* **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** Calculated as (Operating Income * (1 – Tax Rate) * (1 – Reinvestment rate)).
* **Present Value of FCF:** Calculated by discounting each year's FCF using the appropriate discount rate for each year: 1/(1+WACC)^n.

| Year | FCF ($ millions) | Cost of Capital | Discount Factor | PV of FCF ($ millions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  $4,256 | 9.0% | 0.917 | $3,902 |
| 2 | $5,677 | 9.0% | 0.842 | $4,785 |
| 3 | $7,440 | 9.0% | 0.772 | $5,745 |
| 4 | $9,188 | 9.0% | 0.708 | $6,510 |
| 5 | $10,025 | 9.0% | 0.650 | $6,516 |

... (FCF projections and PV calculations continued for years 6-10) ...

* **Terminal Value (Year 10):**  $75,999 Million 
* **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $35,622 Million (discounted back to the present)
* **Enterprise Value:** $88.5 Billion (Sum of PV of FCFs + PV of Terminal Value).

**Note:** Additional adjustments for nonoperating assets (cash, marketable securities), noncontrolling interests,  and debt would be needed to arrive at a final equity value per share.  However, as a pessimistic valuation, we assume there are no material nonoperating assets, noncontrolling interests or debt, and thus the $88.5 Billion enterprise value is used as our overall estimate for the company's value.
