Airbnb operates a two-sided online marketplace platform connecting hosts (individuals renting out their properties) and guests (individuals seeking lodging).  It has become a leading player in the alternative accommodation market, challenging traditional hotels.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Airbnb benefits from a network effect.  As more hosts list properties on the platform, it becomes more attractive to guests, and as more guests use the platform, it becomes more appealing to hosts. This two-sided network is a valuable asset. (Dorsey, "The Little Book That Builds Wealth") However, the network effect is not as strong as other network businesses (Visa, Mastercard, or MSFT, for example).  There are low switching costs for both hosts and guests. Guests can easily switch between Airbnb and other platforms like VRBO or Booking.com, or choose to stay at a hotel. Hosts can also easily list their properties on other platforms, or remove their listings entirely. The limited differentiation between listings and the increased commoditization of the online travel agent industry further weaken the network effect.  While Airbnb has scale advantages, it faces competition in every market and these advantages are not strong enough to be the foundation of a wide moat.

**Management (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:** The management team, led by Brian Chesky, has a solid track record of growing the platform since its inception. However, the company's path to profitability has been longer and less consistent than some of its tech peers. The company's recent strong profitability can be attributed to reduced travel spending during the pandemic and subsequent boom, and its long-term sustainability remains to be seen. From 2Q21 call, the management states that they aim to increase guest satisfaction and enhance the guest experience; and simultaneously, they aim to increase host engagement and enhance the host experience. This strategy of focusing on customer satisfaction is similar to Booking.com's business model. Hence, based on their relatively narrow competitive advantage, which offers no clear differentiation from Booking.com, Airbnb does not look like a business that can generate superprofits.
* **Communication/Transparency:**  Airbnb's management provides adequate financial and strategic information to investors. However, they often talk more about metrics like gross booking value and nights and experiences booked, metrics that often mask real profitability. (Damodaran, "The Little Book of Valuation")
* **Capital Allocation:** Airbnb has been repurchasing shares, which is a positive move given the undervaluation of the stock, but it hasn't done so at the same scale as some peers (for examples, see Michael Burry's Journal April 2001). 
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation appears to be a typical mix of cash and equity and has not raised any red flags.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is not as high as in other founder-led companies, but it is not low enough to raise concerns either.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **International Expansion:**  Airbnb has significant growth potential in emerging markets (as stated by management in 3Q20 Earnings Call). However, these markets also come with increased risks and uncertainty, particularly from a valuation perspective, so these risks must be considered (Damodaran, "The Little Book of Valuation"). Given the market for online travel agents is currently highly fragmented, Airbnb could expand its scale in international markets through acquisitions and joint ventures and, hopefully, get to dominate the market.
* **New Products/Services:** Airbnb is exploring expanding beyond its core business of providing a platform for lodging accommodations, by offering adjacent services like Experiences and potentially flights and car rentals. These extensions may carry additional risk but also significant upside as seen in the example of Amazon.com moving from online books retailer to a general e-commerce retailer.
* **Improving Host Economics:** Initiatives to make hosting more lucrative (like incentivizing more listings and simplifying the onboarding process) could increase the supply of listings and further strengthen the network effect.

**Valuation ($65.8 Billion):**

We used a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** approach to value Airbnb.  A DCF valuation estimates the intrinsic value by discounting the present value of expected cash flows on the business (equity or enterprise DCF) or the equity (equity DCF) at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate.

{: .note }

Given that Airbnb is a young company whose revenues show dramatic improvement, we elected to derive a range of values for Airbnb, rather than just a single value. We developed three scenarios: business-as-usual, an aggressive acquisition scenario, and a less optimistic one.


* **Base Case (Business-as-Usual):**

    1. **Revenue Growth:** We assume Airbnb's revenue will increase from $8.4 billion in 2022 to $21.1 billion in 2032, which includes 5% annual growth.
    2. **Operating Margin:** We estimate a 25% operating margin in steady state, consistent with peers like Booking.com.  (Airbnb IPO 2020 Prospectus)
    3. **Reinvestment Rate:** We used a reinvestment rate of 10%, which is simply (1- Payout Ratio) and reflects how much of the operating profits is reinvested in core operations (or how much is paid out to investors as dividends or stock buybacks). 
    4. **Cost of Capital:** We used a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.56%. We derived this by estimating the costs of equity and debt, weighting them by market value, and incorporating a tax rate of 25%. (Airbnb 10-K 2022) For further details on cost of capital and all other input assumptions, see Airbnb 10-K filing for the year ending December 31, 2022.
    5. **Terminal Value:** We calculated a terminal value using the perpetuity growth method, assuming 3% terminal growth and a return on capital of 12% (Airbnb's current return on capital) and discounting the terminal cash flows back to present value. (Damodaran, Valuation)

    * **Calculation:**
        * Terminal Value = (After-tax operating income in year 10) \* (1 - Reinvestment rate) / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate)
        * Terminal Value = ($4,087 (1 - 0.2667)) / (0.075-0.03) = $49.4 Billion.
        * Present Value of Operating Assets = $29.5 Billion. (McKinsey "Valuation")

* **Aggressive Acquisition Scenario:** We assume Airbnb successfully makes acquisitions to increase growth and operating margins, which leads to higher revenues ($25.1 Billion) and a higher operating margin (30%) in 2032.  

* **Less Optimistic Scenario:** We assume lower revenue growth (3%) due to increased competition, a 20% operating margin, and a higher cost of capital (8%).

{: .important }

To arrive at the companyâ€™s value per share, we calculate the sum of the present values of cash flows for 10 years ($5.4 Billion) and of the terminal value ($43.95 Billion).

**Result:**

Using probability weighting (40% for Base Case, 30% for Aggressive, 30% for Less Optimistic) we get an intrinsic value of $65.8 billion. (This represents a more conservative range of $43.16 to $93.55 per share at 712 million shares outstanding). The midpoint is closer to our base case because we increased the probability weightings of the business-as-usual scenario. (McKinsey "Valuation")

**Airbnb's Recent Challenges/Controversies:**

* **Regulatory Scrutiny:**  Airbnb faces regulatory challenges in various jurisdictions related to taxes, licensing, and housing regulations. (Airbnb 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022 and Airbnb 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2023)
* **Competition:** Competition is increasing from both established hotel chains and other online travel platforms.
* **Safety and Security:**  Concerns about safety and security for both guests and hosts remain a potential issue. (Airbnb 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022)

The management has addressed these concerns in earnings calls by emphasizing ongoing efforts to work with regulators, enhance trust and safety measures, and highlighting investments in technology and customer support.
