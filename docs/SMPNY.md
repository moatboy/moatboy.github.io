{: .important}
Let's break down SMPNY's financials to gain a clearer perspective:
  *  **Revenues:** SMPNY’s revenues are very varied, but there is solid, growing revenue overall. For the quarter ending December 31, 2023, operating revenues were $2.02 billion.
  *   **Margins:** Gross profit margin in 2023 was about 20% which implies the average for all businesses, but the gross profit margins do vary depending on the type of business. Net profit margins in 2023 were around 2%.
   * **Expenses:** The biggest expenses for SMPNY are clearing and brokerage costs, commissions, compensation and other expenses. 
  *   **Profits and ROIC:** Profitability is affected by market conditions, but generally the company does tend to make profits and have stable ROIC. ROIC in the past 5 years has been around 5 to 12%. 
  *   **Balance Sheet:** The company has a solid balance sheet. Long-term debt was $858 million and equity was $1.8 billion in September 2023. Also, the company has enough cash to fund the business and acquisitions and other general business purposes. It has a high current ratio and quick ratio. 

### Moat Analysis: 2 / 5
{: .highlight}
SMPNY does have certain traits that give it a weak competitive advantage but it is not enough to be considered a wide moat company.
*  **Barriers to Entry**: The regulatory and capital requirements in the financial services industry act as a minor barrier to entry, and give the existing incumbents a little bit of an advantage.
*  **Established Client Relationships**: The company’s long-standing relationships with its clients make them somewhat sticky and are a key advantage. 
 *  **Brand Recognition**: Although not a primary brand name for most consumers, the company has good brand recognition within specific sectors where it plays.

The weakness of these traits and the fact that there are many more prominent players in the same sector means that SMPNY has a very narrow moat.

 **Legitimate Risks That Could Harm the Moat and Business Resilience:**
{: .warning}
*   **Technological Disruption:** Newer fintech companies are quickly developing better methods of trading and offering services, and it's a serious risk that the business can be disrupted. This could disrupt operations, erode profits, and make the moat obsolete.
*   **Regulatory Changes:** New regulations and legal hurdles can dramatically impact how the business operates and its earnings. There's also the risk of governments taking action against the company in general.
*   **Market Volatility:** SMPNY's profitability is tied to the fluctuation in the global markets. Any global economic decline or other market volatility will make the company unable to earn consistent profits and could hurt its stock price. 
 * **Execution Risk:** The ability to execute well on M&A and integrate companies effectively is critical. Acquisitions that are not successful will erode the company’s resources and ability to make profits. 
*  **Concentration Risk:** A large portion of its operations and profits come from some big clients and some geographic locations. If any of that were to change, then it would significantly impact its growth. 
*  **Poor Capital Allocation:** Since most of SMPNY’s investments are made in acquisitions, poor capital allocation could hurt shareholders and reduce profitability. 

Despite these risks, SMPNY has shown resilience in weathering past economic downturns by focusing on diversification and risk management strategies.

### Understandability: 3/5

The company is more complex than usual since it operates in multiple different fields and also is susceptible to many different economic variables. Understanding the core business is not too difficult, but it is not readily easy to master all aspects of its business model and value proposition.

### Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5

The company has good financial health. The company has a current ratio of over 1.5 and is able to pay all short-term liabilities. Furthermore, there's solid and growing equity with an established trend in profits and revenues. The company has also historically shown good cash reserves. However, the long-term debt does need to be looked out for, but there are no imminent risks. Overall, the company’s balance sheet is healthy.
