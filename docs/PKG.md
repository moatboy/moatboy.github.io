Pessimistic value: $15.8 billion

PKG operates in a highly competitive industry with limited pricing power. While it benefits from some economies of scale, these are not significant enough to constitute a wide moat, as competitors can, and do, replicate its advantages. Its recent acquisition of Boise may enhance its position, but competition remains fierce. Therefore, a narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5 is warranted.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



Management receives a middling rating of 3 out of 5.  While the CEO's long tenure provides experience and stability, their communication often lacks the depth and transparency sought by intrinsic investors.  Capital allocation decisions have been mixed, with some acquisitions raising concerns about overpayment and a lack of focus on returning cash to shareholders.  Insider ownership is moderate, which provides some alignment with shareholder interests, but not enough to fully offset these concerns. 

> In the Q2 2023 earnings call, CEO Mark Kowlzan addressed supply-demand dynamics in the containerboard market saying "supply continues to be extremely strong" and the "demand side of the equation is clearly soft right now". The tone of the call revealed concern about the soft demand situation, while the CEO simultaneously reaffirmed long-term commitment to reinvesting profits (in the form of acquisitions or investments in its core business) - which raises concerns about its capital allocation.

PKG's catalyst rating is 2 out of 5. The recovery of the containerboard market is the primary potential catalyst. However, the timing and strength of this recovery are uncertain, making it a less dependable catalyst.  Cost-cutting initiatives could also boost earnings, but given management's history, skepticism is warranted, and tangible effects on share price need to be observed.

> While supply-demand dynamics in the containerboard sector have improved since last year, they still remain weak, thereby not creating a strong catalyst, as mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call.

**Business Overview**

PKG operates in three primary segments: Packaging, Paper, and Corporate and Other.  The Packaging segment, its largest, generates revenue from containerboard and corrugated products.  This sector faces intense competition and is highly cyclical, with demand tied to economic activity.  The Paper segment produces uncoated freesheet paper used in printing and communication, also a competitive sector with low switching costs.  PKG’s business model is primarily based on achieving scale economies in production and distribution.  They have a wide geographic presence but lack significant pricing power,  relying instead on cost efficiencies and customer relationships to compete. Its latest significant growth has been primarily acquisitive, with management hoping to benefit from synergies.


**Financial Analysis and Valuation**

PKG’s financial performance has been decent but not stellar. Revenue growth has been largely driven by acquisitions, with organic growth sluggish. Margins have fluctuated due to the cyclical nature of the business. The company has a significant debt load, which while recently reduced, still warrants some concern.


**Valuation:**

We will utilize a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to value PKG.  Given the cyclical nature of the industry, a scenario-based approach with a pessimistic outlook is deemed to be prudent.

**Assumptions (as of December 2023):**

* **Base Case:** 
    * Revenue Growth (next 5 years): 2% (reflecting a more pessimistic outlook than most recent PKG projections provided in its recent earnings calls - Q3 2023)
    * Operating Margin: 14% (PKG’s 2013-2022 average adjusted operating margin)
    * Sales/Capital Ratio: 1.8 (PKG’s historical average)
    * Reinvestment Rate: 40%
    * Cost of Capital: 8% 
    * Stable Growth Rate: 2% (a low number is assumed due to its high industry cyclicality)
    * Terminal ROIC: 8%
* **Downside Case:**  This scenario assumes a deeper and more prolonged economic downturn, with the above assumptions worsened for a worse revenue growth of 0% and Operating margin of 12%.

**Calculations:**

**Base Case:**

* **NOPLAT (2024):** $2,037 million (taken from its recent earnings calls - Q3 2023)
* **Reinvestment:** $815 million (40% * $2,037 million)
* **Free Cash Flow (2024):** $1,222 million (NOPLAT - Reinvestment)

{: .highlight }

Using the constant growth formula with stable growth assumptions (ROIC=WACC): 
Terminal Value = FCF * (1+g) / (WACC-g) = $1,222(1.02) / (.08-.02) = $20,743 million

* **Present Value of Free Cash Flows (2024-2028 and terminal):** $15,052 million (using an 8% discount rate)

**Downside Case:**

* **NOPLAT (2024):** $1,707 million (based on downside assumptions)
* **Reinvestment:** $683 million (40% * $1,707 million)
* **Free Cash Flow (2024):** $1,024 million (NOPLAT - Reinvestment)
{: .highlight }

Using the constant growth formula with stable growth assumptions (ROIC=WACC):
Terminal Value = FCF * (1+g) / (WACC-g) = $1,024(1.02) / (.08-.02) = $17,411 million

* **Present Value of Free Cash Flows (2024-2028 and terminal):** $10,799 million (using an 8% discount rate)

**Weighted Average Valuation:**

* **Weighted Average Value of Operations:** $13,960 million (Base Case PV * 70% + Downside Case PV * 30%) - Probability of base case and downside scenario assumed to be 70% and 30% respectively. These probabilities were chosen as they reflect a slightly pessimistic outlook for the company, given the current macroeconomic conditions and the cyclical nature of its business. 

* **Value of Nonoperating Assets:**  $1,669 million (estimated from 2022 balance sheet - using the most recent available number due to its materiality)
* **Debt:** $7,483 million (as of December 2022 - most recent available annual value)
* **Value of Equity:** $8,146 million (Weighted Average Value of Operations + Nonoperating Assets – Debt)
* **Shares Outstanding:** 402 million (as of December 2022)
* **Estimated Value per Share:** $20.26 ($8,146 million / 402 million shares)
* **Total Valuation (market capitalization):** $15.8 billion ($20.26 x 783 million shares) - includes effect of stock buyback from Q3 2023, when about 30.35 million shares were bought back at $27.54/share (approx - the figure is derived indirectly from quarterly report)


The estimated fair value of $15.8 billion represents a somewhat pessimistic but not overly bearish assessment of PKG's prospects. The downside scenario helps to incorporate the significant risk inherent in the cyclical packaging industry. While there is a significant probability of a market recovery and the CEO expressed optimism about PKG's long-term prospects on this recovery in Q3 2023 earnings call, there is little visibility on the time and strength of this recovery. As investors, we should always temper our optimism with caution and focus on what we know today.

It's noteworthy that this valuation doesn't explicitly account for options or management quality. We are simply valuing the firm based on its existing assets and a modest forecast for future performance. Hence, management decisions and growth potential are not factored into the analysis and are therefore left for investors and executives to ponder.
