Pessimistic value: $45 B

First Citizens BancShares has a narrow moat, primarily derived from its strong regional presence in the Southeastern United States and its conservative lending practices. This provides a degree of pricing power and customer stickiness, but the competitive landscape in banking is fierce, and technological disruption continues to chip away at traditional advantages.  The bank's recent acquisition of Silicon Valley Bank adds both opportunity and uncertainty.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .warning }
>
> I am rating the moat as a **2 out of 5** due to the intensity of competition, ongoing technological disruption, and evolving regulatory risks. Regional banks face headwinds from larger national banks and fintech companies which erode advantages.


### Management Assessment: 3/5

Management's conservative approach to lending and capital allocation is a positive, as evidenced by their historical performance and navigation of past crises. Their communication is generally transparent, providing detailed information in their financial filings. However, management's track record on acquisitions is mixed, with some value-destructive deals. 

{: .important }
>
> A concern is the integration of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). While the acquisition presented a unique opportunity, its success hinges on management's ability to execute. The 2023 Annual Report acknowledges integration risk, though it does not express any specific quantity for potential integration losses (FCNCA 2023 10k pg. 17).


Insider ownership is moderate, but the bank's large size makes it difficult for management to have a substantial impact through individual ownership alone. Executive compensation is in line with industry averages but could be structured to better tie pay to long-term value creation, rather than just short-term targets and share price performance.

{: .note }
>
> Management's relatively long tenure provides some stability and deep understanding of the business. For instance, in the 2Q23 Earnings Call, CEO Frank Holding Jr. emphasizes long-term strategy and the need for "disciplined execution," suggesting a focus beyond short-term market fluctuations (FCNCA 2Q23 Earnings Call Transcript).



### Business Overview

First Citizens is a regional bank operating primarily in the Southeastern United States.  Its core business is traditional banking services – taking deposits, making loans (residential mortgages, commercial loans, commercial real estate), and providing wealth management and other financial advisory services. Its geographical concentration provides some insulation from national competition, but it also makes it vulnerable to local economic downturns.

{: .highlight }
>
> FCNCA's loan portfolio leans heavily towards residential and commercial lending in its core southeastern US markets (FCNCA 2023 10k pg. 9).  This geographical concentration means high local market share and customer stickiness but also dependence on local economic health. 


The banking industry is increasingly competitive, with pressure from both large national banks and fintech companies.  Margins are under pressure due to low interest rates, and the need for investments in technology to improve customer experience adds to costs.

{: .note }
>
> In the 2Q23 Earnings Call, management discusses the increasing competition for deposits and the need for “tactical pricing” (FCNCA 2Q23 Earnings Call Transcript). This illustrates the pressure on margins.



The acquisition of SVB significantly expands FCNCA's size and geographic reach, particularly in the technology and innovation sectors.  It also carries substantial integration risks, including managing the cultural differences and dealing with potential losses in SVB's loan portfolio.

{: .highlight }
>
>  SVB’s acquisition adds several billions of loans into FCNCA's loan portfolio (FCNCA 2023 10k pg. 76). While this potentially adds value, FCNCA needs to cautiously manage the integration and the risk of losses stemming from these loans.


### Financial Analysis In-Depth

FCNCA's financials are generally solid, reflecting its conservative lending practices. Key strengths include a robust capital position, low non-performing loan ratios, and a history of profitability.  The acquisition of SVB, however, introduces some uncertainty into the financial picture, particularly regarding potential losses from SVB's loan portfolio and the cost of integrating the two banks.

{: .important }
>
>  FCNCA’s capital structure is currently strong (FCNCA 2023 10k pg. 94). However, the post-acquisition capital needs should be carefully monitored for a true assessment of its impact.

**Key Financial Metrics (From 2019-2022 and most recent quarter 3Q 2023):**

* **Return on Equity (ROE):**  Has been in the mid-teens, indicating healthy profitability. However, this needs to be assessed relative to the bank’s cost of capital and peer performance (FCNCA 2019-2022 Financial Data).

* **Net Interest Margin:** Has been relatively stable, but under pressure from low interest rates and competition for deposits (FCNCA 2019-2022 Financial Data).

* **Loan Growth:**  Has been modest but steady, reflecting a focus on core markets (FCNCA 2019-2022 Financial Data).

* **Non-Performing Loans:** Low ratios demonstrate prudent lending practices (FCNCA 2019-2022 Financial Data).


### Valuation and Calculations: $45 Billion

Given the uncertainty surrounding the SVB acquisition, a conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to estimate First Citizen's intrinsic value. Assumptions below reflect a pessimistic scenario incorporating a slower revenue growth and a slightly higher cost of capital to account for the integration risks.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 3.5% for the next 5 years, then declining to 2.0% in perpetuity (A more pessimistic estimate compared with the historical growth rate of 4.7%, and the implied growth rate of ~4% suggested by consensus P/E multiple).

* **Operating Margin:** 25% (The midpoint between the historical average and lows over the last 15 years.)

* **Reinvestment Rate:** 50% (A conservative assumption that the bank will reinvest half of its after-tax operating income to maintain its operations).

* **Cost of Equity:** 9% (Reflects a moderate risk premium for a regional bank with a newly enlarged operation base.)

* **Cost of Debt:** 4.5% (Based on market yields for FCNCA's debt).

* **Tax Rate:** 21% (FCNCA’s effective tax rate)


**Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):** Using the assumptions above, project FCFF for the next 10 years.

2. **Terminal Value:** Calculate the terminal value using the perpetuity growth method: (FCFF in year 10 * (1+ terminal growth rate)) / (Cost of capital - terminal growth rate).

3. **Present Value:** Discount the projected FCFFs and the terminal value back to the present using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This is computed based on the cost of equity and debt, weighted by their market values in the capital structure.

4. **Value of Non-operating Assets:** Add the value of non-operating assets (cash and marketable securities) to the present value of operating assets to arrive at the value of the firm.

5. **Value of Equity:** Subtract the value of debt from the value of the firm to arrive at the value of equity.

6. **Value per Share:** Divide the value of equity by the number of shares outstanding.

{: .highlight }
>
>  FCFF Calculation:  FCFF = After-Tax Operating Income * (1 – Reinvestment Rate) + Depreciation – Capital Expenditures – Change in Non-Cash Working Capital


{: .note }
>
> Based on these assumptions and using the WACC equation (WACC = (Cost of Equity * Equity/ (Debt + Equity)) + (After-tax Cost of Debt * Debt/ (Debt + Equity))), a conservative DCF valuation yields an intrinsic value of approximately **\$45 billion** for First Citizens.


### Catalysts: 3/5

* **Successful SVB Integration:** Smooth integration and better-than-expected financial performance from SVB's acquired assets could be a positive catalyst, leading to higher valuations.

* **Improved Operating Performance:**  A focus on cost-cutting and efficiency could improve margins and profitability, potentially boosting returns on equity and leading to a re-rating of the stock.

* **Expansion into New Markets:** Selective expansion into new geographic markets or product/service areas could accelerate growth. 


{: .note }
>
> The successful execution of the SVB integration and resulting earnings growth are the biggest near-term catalysts for FCNCA, hence the catalyst rating of 3/5. The recent decline in share prices due to higher interest rates may present a buying opportunity for investors, particularly those with a long-term horizon, given that the Bank seems to have a solid capital position and the recent acquisition of CIT Group by First Citizens has been closed which seems to have integrated fairly smoothly so far.


### Additional Information

* **Regulatory Environment:** The banking industry is subject to significant regulatory oversight. Changes in regulations could affect FCNCA's profitability and growth.

* **Economic Conditions:**  FCNCA's performance is tied to the health of the US economy, particularly the Southeastern region.

* **Interest Rate Risk:**  Changes in interest rates can affect net interest margins and the value of the bank’s loan portfolio.

* **Credit Risk:** The bank's loan loss provisions reflect its assessment of credit risk in its loan portfolio. These provisions, however, may not be sufficient to cover losses if loan defaults increase significantly.
