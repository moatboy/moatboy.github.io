>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution (2023):**  Iron ore (55%), Aluminum (17%), Copper (9%), Minerals (14%), Energy (5%). This distribution is not materially different from what has existed over the past decade.
* **Industry Trends:** The mining industry is cyclical and commodity-driven.  Demand for Rio's commodities is tied to global economic growth and industrial production. 
* **Margins:** Margins fluctuate with commodity prices.  Over the long term, margins tend to revert to the mean, eroding excess profits.  This dynamic is exacerbated by commodity industries being in the mature stage of their lifecycle. The business is susceptible to technological shifts, such as increasing automation, that could render commodity businesses (mining) less relevant.
* **Growth:** Growth comes from developing new mines and expanding production in existing mines.  Sustaining high growth is challenging in the commodity industry, as these projects are large in scale and subject to environmental regulations, political instability, and commodity price fluctuations. Rio Tinto's average annual organic revenue growth for the 10 years prior to 2024 was about 2%, and the company's recent growth has been driven by higher earnings from rising commodity prices.
* **Capital allocation:** Rio Tinto's capital allocation policy is heavily driven by its capital expenditure (capex) needs in its core businesses.

**Moat Analysis**

Rio Tinto has some cost advantages stemming from its ownership of high-quality, long-life resource deposits, specifically in iron ore and aluminum.  These deposits have lower extraction costs than many peers. However, the cost advantage is not absolute, as competitors also have access to large resource deposits, particularly in developing markets.  Furthermore, commodity prices play an outsized role in profitability, which diminishes the long-term importance of cost advantages.  The company's other businesses (copper, minerals, and energy) have few durable competitive advantages and are exposed to intense competition.  Furthermore, industry developments such as the growing availability of substitutes for some commodities (e.g., iron ore pellets) present a challenge to incumbents.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

The cyclical nature of the commodity business and the potential for erosion of cost advantages over time merit a **moat rating of 2 out of 5**.  While Rio Tinto currently benefits from large, high-quality reserves, these advantages are unlikely to provide a sustainable long-term competitive advantage.  The industry structure is becoming increasingly consolidated, with the top three companies accounting for more than 25% of global market share, which is likely to intensify competition over time.

**Valuation**

We will perform a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of Rio Tinto using the following assumptions:

* **Base Case:** Reflects a moderate long-term outlook with a growth rate in line with nominal GDP growth and 2023 margins.
* **Aggressive Case:**  Assumes growth above GDP growth thanks to several successful acquisitions that leverage cost efficiencies and create substantial synergies.
* **Pessimistic Case:**  Includes a downturn in the global commodity market and the potential for a further decline in commodity prices.

**Key Assumptions (Base Case)**

* **Revenue Growth:** Long-run real GDP growth in the U.S. and other developed economies of 2.7%.  This growth rate can be estimated using a 10-year government bond rate of 3.2% minus a historical risk premium on long-term U.S. government bonds of 0.5% (3.2–0.5=2.7). {: .note}
* **Operating Margin:**  Constant at 14% (2023 level).
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (2023 level).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% of after-tax operating income, estimated using the sales-to-capital ratio of 4.5 (from the company’s financials).  Long-run reinvestment rate gradually declines to 3% in year 10 and beyond.
* **Cost of Capital:**  9.4% (Risk-free rate: 3.2%, Equity risk premium: 6%, Beta: 0.83, Tax rate: 25%, Debt: 15%). Risk-free rate has been derived from government zero-coupon yields and the equity risk premium from a modified version of the key value driver formula. Company beta has been derived from the regression of the company's stock return against MSCI World Index. This results in a cost of equity of 8.2% (3.2+6\*0.83=8.2). The company's cost of debt is 4.1%. Given the current capital structure of the company, the WACC is 7.4%.
