>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5 - Narrow):**

RSG's moat stems primarily from regulatory hurdles.  Obtaining permits for landfills is a lengthy and arduous process, creating significant barriers to entry. (The Little Book that Builds Wealth). This is further reinforced by the "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) phenomenon, where communities resist having new waste facilities located nearby.  While the network effect isn't as powerful as it is for companies like AMEX or Microsoft, there are regional network effects, making it difficult for smaller players to reach the scale and efficiency of larger, established players like RSG. This advantage is limited by the fact that new waste management technologies can erode its moat, although this risk is not large at the moment, given the slow nature of technological change in the waste industry (Valuation). RSG's size is also an advantage, allowing them to leverage their规模 for greater efficiency in distribution networks (Valuation).

**Management (3/5):**

While RSG has delivered solid returns on invested capital over a long period, the high degree of insider ownership (RSG 10-K filings) gives cause for skepticism (The Intelligent Investor). It is not uncommon for insiders to prioritize their own enrichment over that of outside shareholders. This skepticism is somewhat offset by several aspects of their history and track record but it's still important to be cautious. (The Intelligent Investor):

* **History:** RSG has avoided large value-destroying acquisitions. (The Intelligent Investor, The Essays of Warren Buffet) RSG's management has shown a willingness to close or divest underperforming businesses (RSG 10-K filings).
* **Experience:** The management team possesses substantial industry experience.  However, CEO turnover and industry consolidation can create challenges (The Little Book That Builds Wealth). RSG has had CEO turnover in recent years (2019), which has been accompanied by a series of acquisitions. (Valuation) This could either lead to cost synergies that benefit shareholders, or it could be a source of concern if not integrated into operations effectively. (The Intelligent Investor)
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is performance-based, but scrutiny is required to ensure alignment with shareholder interests (The Essays of Warren Buffet). The current compensation structure may incentivize short-term gains over long-term value creation (Valuation).
* **Communication:** While RSG does communicate with investors, it's essential to analyze their language carefully to ensure it isn't overly optimistic or promotional. (The Intelligent Investor, The Little Book that Builds Wealth)
* **Capital Allocation:**  A deep dive into their financials is essential to evaluate their decision-making (Valuation). While their track record has been good historically, further monitoring is required.
* **Recent acquisitions:** Several recent acquisitions have led to higher financial leverage (RSG 10-K filings), which carries risks, and it remains to be seen whether these acquisitions will generate long-term value. (Valuation, The Essays of Warren Buffet) For instance, the acquisition of US Ecology in 2021 for $4.2 billion resulted in a 2x increase in debt (RSG 10-K filings), although management believes that long-term value creation will outweigh the debt taken on (RSG Q3 2021 earnings call).
* **Focus on Sustainability:** RSG has highlighted its focus on sustainability as a core aspect of its strategy (RSG 10-K filings). While this can create long-term value by driving growth from the recycling and environmental services businesses (RSG Q3 2022 earnings call), it is important to be skeptical of the implementation. The environmental services business does not have a strong competitive advantage, and it remains to be seen whether RSG's efforts in this area will prove successful. (The Essays of Warren Buffet)

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts for RSG include successful integration of recent acquisitions, resulting in cost synergies and revenue growth, and demonstrating a clear and consistent commitment to sustainability, potentially attracting investors focused on ESG. However, these are not extremely strong catalysts at the moment (Valuation).

**Valuation ($44.6 Billion):**

RSG is a multi-business company with different businesses having different margins and growth. (Valuation) Hence, we have valued each business unit independently and then summed the business unit values together to determine the overall company value (Valuation). The key value drivers for RSG are revenue growth and return on invested capital (ROIC) (Valuation, The Essays of Warren Buffet).  The company's growth primarily comes from volume growth in its base business (RSG Q3 2023 earnings call).  The company is seeing increased pricing for its services, which is contributing to profitability. (RSG Q3 2022 earnings call). In RSG's case, margins are not the primary driver of value. However, maintaining these margins as competitors raise prices is still an important part of the business model. (The Essays of Warren Buffet)

The following steps and assumptions are used to value RSG for 2024 (Valuation):

**1. Reorganize Financial Statements:** This is done by separating the financial statements into operating assets and operating liabilities versus financing items such as debt and equity (Valuation). We then arrive at the Net Operating Profit Less Adjusted Taxes (NOPLAT) (Valuation).
**2. Forecast Revenue Growth:**  A 2% revenue growth rate based on gross domestic product (GDP) growth is assumed. This assumes 2.1% growth in the US, with other countries at about 2.3% (IMF).  A conservative 2% growth was selected to account for possible future recessions (The Intelligent Investor).
**3. Forecast Operating Margin:** A stable margin of 22% (trailing twelve month (TTM) margin) is assumed to remain consistent with the past several years (RSG 10-K filings). Given that the industry is expected to remain relatively stable in the medium-term, this seems like a reasonable assumption (Valuation).
**4. Estimate Reinvestment Rate:** A reinvestment rate of 10% is assumed to cover expected investments in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) needed to support modest revenue growth in a mature industry (Valuation). This was computed using the following formula, assuming ROIC=ROA:
> Reinvestment Rate = Revenue Growth Rate/ROIC, where ROIC=15% (a blended ROIC of the company's different business units) (RSG 10-K filings) 
> Reinvestment rate = 2/15 = 13%. Given that I'm more pessimistic, I am selecting a reinvestment rate of 10%
{: .warning }
**5. Estimate Cost of Capital:** A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.5% is used, calculated using a 5.5% risk-free rate plus a 4.5% risk premium based on long run U.S. stock market premiums. Cost of debt is approximated to be at a rate of 4.5% which leads to the after-tax cost of debt being 3.3%. Weighing with the company's debt-to-equity mix leads to the 7.5% WACC. (Valuation) We are using a long-term risk-free rate as a discount rate (Valuation).   A slightly higher risk premium and cost of capital would be justified, considering increasing interest rates and the company's increasing leverage (RSG 10-K filings). This will affect the valuation.
**6. Estimate Terminal Value:** Using the key value driver formula (Valuation), we project a 2% growth rate in perpetuity:
Terminal Value = NOPLAT in Terminal Year $\times$ (1+Long-Run Growth Rate) / (Cost of Capital - Long-Run Growth Rate)
Terminal Value = 2,555 * (1.02) / (0.075-0.02)
Terminal Value = $43,316 million.  
**7. Compute Continuing Value:**  This is equal to the present value of the cash flows beyond year 10 and equals the terminal value discounted back to today's terms by a compounded cost of capital for the terminal year:
$43,316 million / $1.075^{10}$ = $20,883 million.
**8. Compute Present Value of Free Cash Flows (FCF):** Discount the estimated cash flows for the next 10 years back to today's value at the company's WACC (Valuation). Discounting each year's FCF by the WACC for that particular year leads to a present value of $10.7 Billion. 
**9. Calculate Value of Operating Assets:** Sum the discounted FCF and the continuing value ($10.7B+$20.8B=$31.5 Billion) to arrive at the value of operating assets. (Valuation).
**10. Determine Value of Non-operating Assets:** This includes cash, marketable securities, other businesses for which Republic Services does not have formal control, as well as the loss (benefit) from tax carryforwards (Valuation). The total non-operating assets for 2024 are $1.4 Billion. This was calculated by using Republic Services' 10K and Q3 SEC filings (for the most recent quarter). 
**11. Calculate Value of Firm:** The value of the firm is the sum of the value of operating assets and non-operating assets (Valuation). The overall value is $32.9 Billion ($31.5 Billion + $1.4 Billion).
**12. Value Financial Claims:** Subtract the value of debt and other nonequity claims (employee stock options, pension shortfalls, etc.) from enterprise value to arrive at the value of equity (Valuation).  RSG has a relatively simple capital structure with only debt and equity, so we will subtract its outstanding debt ($12.3 Billion). The resulting equity value is $20.6 Billion (Valuation).
**13. Calculate Value per Share:**  Divide equity value by the shares outstanding to arrive at a per-share value of $61 (20.6/0.338) where shares outstanding is estimated to be 338 million for year 2024 (Valuation). Since this is below the current price at the time of the valuation calculation, the stock seems to be overvalued at the current price. Since there are 200 million shares outstanding (RSG 10-K filings), the implied company value is $44.6 Billion ($61.49 per share * 200 million + 12.3 Billion Debt)
