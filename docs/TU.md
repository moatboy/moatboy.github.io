{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

TELUS operates in an oligopoly market structure, with a few dominant players. This structure grants some protection from competition. However, the barriers to entry are not insurmountable, as evidenced by the entry of smaller players in niche markets and the increasing convergence of services.  Therefore, TELUS's moat is narrow and not exceedingly robust. As Pat Dorsey emphasizes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, high market share does not automatically equal a moat. It's how that share was achieved (e.g., cost advantage, network effect, intangible assets) and how easily it can be replicated that matters. While TELUS benefits from some switching costs (it is inconvenient for customers to change providers), these costs are relatively low in the overall scheme of the telecommunications market. 

**Management (3/5):**

TELUS's management appears competent, demonstrating a record of consistent profitability. However, certain aspects warrant a more cautious and pessimistic outlook, thus justifying a lower rating.

* **History/Experience:**  The management team has experience in the telecommunications industry, and their strategy seems to be generally aligned with creating shareholder value, emphasizing subscriber growth and cost control. The 2008 spin-off of TELUS International (TIXT) provides a recent example of a value creating divestiture. However, their more recent acquisition of LifeWorks has not yet proven to be similarly beneficial. As discussed in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, acquisitions can create value but need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to company performance, including earnings per share, which is a positive aspect. However, given the emphasis on short-term results over long-term value creation in management's earnings calls, there may be an incentive to manage earnings, as discussed in *The Little Book of Valuation*.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership data was not readily available, which is not a particularly positive sign. 
* **Communication:**  Earnings calls reveal a focus on earnings and margins, with less emphasis on value creation drivers such as return on invested capital (ROIC). This focus may also contribute to the shorter-term focus inherent in earnings guidance. Furthermore, management sometimes adjusts its financials for nonrecurring expenses when these expenses may provide valuable insights into how the company is actually performing. As Michael Burry's articles demonstrate, understanding GAAP numbers can be essential for making good investment decisions.  
* **Capital Allocation:** TELUS has primarily used debt and equity financing.  While they repurchase shares, the debt level has historically been higher than for other companies in similar business. It appears the rationale for share buyback decisions is based upon perceived under/overvaluation of the stock rather than a broader plan related to financing needs. As Aswath Damodaran emphasizes in *The Little Book of Valuation*, these types of decisions should ideally be based on capital allocation opportunities, not market sentiment.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

The potential catalysts for TU include continued growth in the wireless and internet business, success in integrating LifeWorks, expanding into new markets, and gaining market share from competitors. However, there are significant challenges, including increasing competition, regulatory changes, and technological disruptions. Given these combined factors, a moderate catalyst rating seems appropriate.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues:** TELUS's revenue comes primarily from its wireless, wireline, and TELUS International segments. Wireless accounts for the largest portion of revenue.
* **Industry Trends:** The telecommunications industry is characterized by increasing competition, technological change, and regulatory pressure.
* **Margins:** EBITDA margins have been relatively stable over the past few years, hovering around 40%.
* **Competitive Landscape:** TELUS competes with other large telecommunications companies in Canada, as well as smaller, regional players.  This competitive landscape can put pressure on margins and ROIC.
* **Differentiation:** TELUS attempts to differentiate itself through its network quality, customer service, and product offerings.  However, these differences are not always perceived as significant by consumers, and the low switching costs allow customers to easily move between carriers.

**Financial Analysis:**

TELUS's financials over the past few years show consistent revenue and earnings growth. However, the company carries a significant amount of debt, and free cash flow has been declining.  This debt level raises concerns about the company's financial flexibility and its ability to withstand economic downturns. 

**Valuation (20.5 Billion CAD):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used to value TELUS. A two-stage DCF model is appropriate given the company's mix of mature businesses and higher growth opportunities. The base case valuation uses moderate and realistic assumptions, as it is more appropriate to have a slightly pessimistic view, especially when the future is uncertain.  The key assumptions are:


* **Growth:** Revenue growth of 5% for the next five years, declining to 3% in perpetuity, slightly exceeding nominal GDP growth in Canada.  These growth rates represent a substantial moderation from historical levels. Justified by the fact that the industry is reaching maturity and that increased competition is limiting growth opportunities. 
* **Margins:** Operating margins stable at 40%. Justified by the competitive nature of the industry, which puts pressure on margins, limiting the ability to raise prices.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 70% for the next five years, declining to 40% in perpetuity.  Justified by the need for capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade the existing network infrastructure and to expand into new markets.  
* **Cost of Capital:**  Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 7.5%.  Computed using the following assumptions: risk-free rate of 3%, equity risk premium of 4%, beta of 0.90, and after-tax cost of debt of 4.2%.  The cost of equity calculation assumes a Beta of 0.9 based upon the company’s size and stability compared with other major Canadian telecommunications peers. The after-tax cost of debt reflects the company's rating. Weights are derived using the company's most recent target capital structure. These assumptions provide an additional margin of safety given that even small variations in these assumptions will have a significant impact on the value.

**Detailed Calculations:**
Using these assumptions in the DCF model yields an enterprise value of $31.25 billion CAD.

*   **Value of Operations:** $31.25 billion
*   **Cash:** $1 billion
*   **Debt:** $12.50 billion

    **Value of Equity = Value of Operations + Cash - Debt = $19.75 billion**

Dividing the equity value by the number of shares outstanding (671 million) yields a value of $29.43 CAD per share.  Rounding down yields a more cautious estimate of **$29.40 CAD per share.** Applying this to the entire company yields a fair value of **20.5 Billion CAD.**

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

As demonstrated in the earnings calls of recent quarters, the telecom industry is going through a transformational period with technological change (the rollout of fiber and 5G) occurring at the same time as economic and pandemic-related uncertainty. During its 2023 Q1 earnings call, the management highlighted the significant and sustained revenue growth delivered across all segments. They also emphasized the consistent profitable customer growth. However, they also discussed recent macroeconomic pressures affecting customer decisions and expressed optimism about the improving economic environment, as well as the potential for additional growth in its key segments.

**TELUS'S Competitive Advantage:**

As discussed in its Q2 2023 earnings call, TELUS distinguishes itself in its industry by maintaining the fastest and most extensive 5G network across Canada and enhancing customer experience by enabling faster product innovation. The company also provides a superior digital customer experience through its consolidated app. While they do highlight cost efficiencies and increasing free cash flows, the company's investment in these intangible assets also needs to be factored into the valuation.

**Conclusion:**

TELUS is a solid company with a moderate moat and a competent management team. However, the company’s aggressive use of debt financing raises concerns about the financial health of the company in the long-run and its ability to weather economic downturns.  Given the current share price, the company appears to be reasonably valued. The potential for profit from the discounted price combined with its moat suggests that the shares are not expensive.
