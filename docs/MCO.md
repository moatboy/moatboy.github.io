>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

Moody's operates within a duopoly, alongside S&P Global, in the credit rating industry.  These two behemoths control a substantial portion of the market. Their primary function is to provide opinions about the creditworthiness of debt issuers, playing a crucial role in the efficient allocation of capital. Moody's revenue primarily originates from two segments:

* **Moody's Investors Service (MIS):** This segment accounts for roughly two-thirds of Moody's revenue and provides credit ratings, research, and data & analytics primarily to institutional investors.  The credit rating business benefits from high switching costs, as changing rating agencies necessitates a tedious process and potential repricing of debt. This division exhibits a relatively stable and predictable revenue stream, even in economic downturns. The industry growth is primarily driven by increased debt issuance across the globe. 

* **Moody's Analytics (MA):** Contributing to about a third of revenue, MA provides software, data, research, and advisory services mainly to banks and financial institutions, but also to corporations and governments. The data and analytics services often provide essential inputs for credit rating. This segment has been growing faster than MIS. MA benefits from the increasing demand for risk management tools across banks and other financial institutions.

> During the Q3 2023 earnings call, management discussed the shift toward ESG and climate risk,  emphasizing how they are integrating ESG data across offerings and increasing staffing in these areas. They are also adding new products and expanding into new geographies. This suggests the company is committed to innovation and staying ahead of the evolving market. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call)


**Competitive Landscape**

The competitive landscape is dominated by the duopoly, posing a significant barrier to entry for new players due to the substantial capital investment needed for building a robust rating service,  establishing trust with investors, and scaling to serve global markets.  Smaller firms exist, but their reach and influence are considerably smaller.

**Key Differentiators**

* **Brand and Reputation:**  Moody's brand is synonymous with creditworthiness. This reputation, built over decades,  is a significant intangible asset.
* **Switching Costs:**  Changing rating agencies is a costly and disruptive process for debt issuers.

**Margins and Trends**

Moody's exhibits healthy operating margins, generally well above 20%, even with recent margin pressure, highlighting its pricing power within the credit rating industry. Growth trends in the industry mirror overall global economic activity, as businesses seek funding through debt issuance. However, the rise of ESG and Climate products and services may drive long-term growth in MA.  Increased globalization provides opportunities for growth, especially for MA, which has a smaller geographic footprint than MIS.

> In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged margin pressure, attributing it to increased costs associated with integrating acquired businesses and strategic investments in new product development, though they said margins will gradually increase in the long term, leading to improved profitability. They also mentioned they are pricing at a premium in areas such as ESG and climate. This suggests a degree of margin resilience through selective pricing. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call)

**Management Assessment**

Moody’s management receives a low rating of 2/5.  Though generally competent, they display a disturbing lack of shareholder-centricity:


* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is very high, exceeding 10x revenue growth, even though much of the company’s high returns are earned on the float and not from its actual business of credit rating. Stock-based compensation is also significant. 
* **Capital Allocation:** While recent financial engineering to repurchase shares and retire debt has lowered the company's ability to reinvest in its business, it has made management appear more adept at value creation than their business results would justify.  Shareholders should be wary of buybacks at prices that may exceed intrinsic value.  Recent acquisitions have also been questionable as a use of capital.
* **Communication:** Management's engagement with shareholders is less transparent than desirable, particularly regarding the breakdown of financials by business segment and revenue driver. This was criticized by an analyst during the Q1 2020 earnings call and was briefly addressed during the Q2 2020 and Q3 2020 earnings calls with a commitment for better business segment and revenue driver disclosure.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership of the company is extremely low, below 1%, even at the board level.  While this low ownership may be partly explained by regulations, such low levels can raise concerns about management’s commitment to long-term shareholder value creation and alignment with shareholder interests.

**Catalyst Assessment**

The catalyst rating for Moody’s is 2/5.  While there are some potential catalysts, they are not particularly compelling:

* **ESG and Climate Risk Focus:** While there is growing interest in ESG and climate risk assessment, translating this into substantial incremental revenue remains uncertain.  
* **Emerging Market Expansion:** Expansion into emerging markets presents a significant growth opportunity, particularly for MA. However, political and economic instability in these regions, along with potential regulatory hurdles,  pose challenges.

**Valuation**

Valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model of the company's equity, with a 10-year explicit forecast period.  A somewhat pessimistic outlook is incorporated, acknowledging management’s guidance that margins will rebound gradually over the next five years.  Other key assumptions include:


* **Revenue Growth:** Organic growth of 3-5% annually, including a global economic recovery by 2025. The growth estimate is more conservative than historical numbers.
* **Margins:** Gradual margin improvement over the next five years, to 22%, assuming intense competition will prevent margin expansion beyond historical levels. Margin is flat thereafter.
* **Cost of Capital:**  Based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, a beta of 0.9, and a pretax cost of debt of 5%, the cost of capital was estimated at 8.5%.

{: .note }
>
> Moody's increased revenue primarily due to inorganic growth in MA segment through acquisitions and a favorable exchange rate. There was a decrease in adjusted operating profit due to increases in selling, general and administrative expense, as well as investments for strategic initiatives.


**Additional Assumptions**

* **Nonoperating assets:** Valued at book value
* **Debt:** $12 billion

**Value of Equity:** $44.5 billion

> Although we incorporate management's expectation of margin growth in our valuation,  we have a somewhat pessimistic view of the company's capacity for long-term value creation based on its recent capital allocation decisions. The market may change its mind or the company may turn itself around, and these financial statements are only snapshots of today's reality.
