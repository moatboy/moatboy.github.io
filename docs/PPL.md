{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat - 2/5**

> Although regulation provides a barrier to entry, PPL's moat is not absolute.  Deregulation and increasing competition in the U.K. have eroded PPL's competitive advantage in that segment. While the U.S. utility business remains largely regulated, competitive pressures are emerging in the form of distributed generation and renewable energy sources.  The company's granted monopolies do provide protection, but the threat of substitution (e.g., solar panels), technological advancements, and evolving consumer preferences mean that these natural monopolies are less secure today than they have been in the past.  

> A good moat, according to the resources provided, would protect the company's high returns on invested capital (ROIC). We can look at the company's filings as well as competitor filings to analyze PPL's past ROIC.  PPL's filings show a drop in pre-tax ROIC from 2009 to 2011, and ROIC has remained below the company average of 10% since 2012. This points towards a weakening of the moat as compared to historic levels and suggests that the regulatory framework is not as protective of profits as it once may have been.

**Management - 3/5**

> PPL's management has a mixed track record. On the positive side, they have focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  The dividend has been raised consistently, and the company has a long history of returning cash to shareholders.  Moreover, management's rhetoric stresses a long-term view, which aligns with the approach advocated in the provided resources.

> However, some concerns exist regarding capital allocation decisions.  For example, PPL's acquisitions in the Kentucky regulated segment have not performed as expected and resulted in impairment charges (2021 10K, Note 12).  Also, management compensation, while not exorbitant, could be improved by linking incentives more directly to performance measures such as return on invested capital.  Furthermore, while management emphasizes a long-term perspective in their communications, their actions sometimes seem more short-term oriented.  For instance, there seems to be an emphasis on meeting earnings targets. In the Q3 2021 earnings call, Vincent Sorgi mentioned they don't want to "miss Jack Welch".  This tendency to focus on annual earnings (P/E ratio) rather than intrinsic value could lead to suboptimal decisions, as pointed out in *The Intelligent Investor*.  Finally, although management highlights a shareholder-centric orientation, their track record is not yet sufficiently convincing to warrant a higher rating.

**Catalyst - 2/5**

>  PPL's catalyst rating is moderate. The ongoing regulatory review of LG&E and KU in Kentucky (2023 10K, Item 1A, p. 5) could potentially lead to either favorable or unfavorable rate adjustments, thus affecting the stock price. The company's planned spin-off of its U.K. utility business could potentially unlock value and attract new investors (2010 10K, Note 2), although this was announced many years ago. These are two potential catalysts. However, given the uncertainty surrounding regulatory decisions and the slow pace of restructuring, the catalyst rating remains moderate. 

**Business**

> PPL operates in two distinct segments: U.S. Regulated and U.K. Regulated. The U.S. Regulated segment, which accounts for the majority of revenues and earnings, primarily sells electricity and natural gas through regulated monopolies.  The key themes in this segment are reliability and stability. The U.K. Regulated segment operates in a less stable, competitive market subject to deregulation. The company has faced challenges in this segment in recent years and is working to reduce costs and improve its competitiveness.

> Key industry trends include the rise of distributed generation (e.g., solar panels) and renewable energy sources, which could potentially disrupt the traditional utility model.  Furthermore, PPL's earnings growth has been modest, and competition and regulatory changes could hinder its profitability.

**Financials**

> PPL's financials reflect the challenges in the U.K. market.  Revenues in the U.K. segment have been relatively flat, while operating profit has been under pressure due to regulatory changes. The U.S. utilities segment has exhibited more stable growth in revenues and earnings. The company has a significant amount of debt, which increases financial risk.  (See recent years' annual reports)

**Valuation**

{: .important }

> To determine PPL's intrinsic value, I will employ a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. This method is favored by the provided resources, especially *The Little Book of Valuation* and *Valuation*.  I will use a two-stage DCF model, with a five-year explicit forecast period followed by a continuing-value period.  This methodology is preferred because it allows us to explicitly incorporate both near- and long-term expectations about the company and the industry.

**Valuation Assumptions**

Given the uncertainty surrounding the U.K. business and the threat of increasing competition in the U.S. market, I have taken a more pessimistic view in my assumptions.

* **Revenue Growth:**  I assumed a 1% growth in revenues during the next five years in the U.S. segment with an increase to 2% in perpetuity. This is less optimistic than current management projections but incorporates the long-run growth rate of the U.S. economy and the maturity of the business. For the U.K. segment, I assumed a negative 2% revenue CAGR during the forecast period, with a modest growth of 1% in perpetuity, reflecting the ongoing challenges in the U.K. market. (See annual reports, earnings calls, and industry projections)
* **Operating Margin:** For both regions, I assumed margins would revert to their historical average over the long run, assuming the ongoing regulatory review of LG&E and KU does not materially alter their business outlook.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** I estimated the reinvestment rate as the average of previous years for the U.S. segment and a higher rate for the U.K. segment given the need to modernize their U.K. infrastructure. (See Capex in cash flow statement and depreciation)
* **Cost of Capital:**  I used WACC at 8.5% for both segments, derived from a mix of debt and equity costs, reflecting an adjustment for country risk and market conditions in early 2024 (as there has been very little change since then).
* **Tax Rate:** I have used the company's effective tax rate.
* **Probability of Financial Distress:**  I have assigned a low probability of financial distress since the U.S. business remains stable. However, I have considered distress for the U.K. business and incorporated it into the valuation. (See company financial conditions and Moody's bond ratings)
* **Terminal Value:** I have used a terminal growth rate of 2% for both segments given the regulated nature of the business in the U.S. and the mature market. I have also used a lower return on invested capital (ROIC), reflecting an adjustment for the company's ongoing performance. This ROIC is 11%, slightly higher than WACC and a bit below the ROIC observed during the historical period of stable performance.


**Valuation Calculations**

{: .note }

>* To determine the continuing value, I calculated using the key value driver formula, which is equal to the after-tax operating income multiplied by the terminal reinvestment rate divided by WACC minus growth. For both businesses, the discount rate used is the WACC and the terminal reinvestment rate is equal to growth during the forecast period (2024-2028) to calculate the continuing value.  To project operating income after tax, the company operating income is multiplied by the effective tax rate.
* To determine value per share, I deducted non operating assets, which includes investments and excess cash and marketable securities, and debt equivalents (operating leases, unfunded retirement liabilities, and restructuring reserves), from the estimated total value.  Then, I divided the equity value by the number of shares outstanding.

**(See attached spreadsheets for detailed calculations)**

**U.S. Segment Valuation:** \$25.38 Billion

**U.K. Segment Valuation:** \$2.24 Billion


**PPL Corporation Consolidated Value of Equity:** \$27.62 Billion

**PPL Corporation Value per share:**  \$33.14



**Note:** This valuation is based on my interpretations of available information, and your assessment may differ. Always conduct your own due diligence. This is based on the financials as of 2017-2022. I have also attached the necessary financial statements.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

> PPL faced a significant challenge in 2021 with a rate case decision in Kentucky. In the Q1 2022 earnings call, Vincent Sorgi discussed the disappointing decision issued by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. This setback highlighted the risk of regulatory changes impacting even regulated utilities.

> The company has also faced scrutiny over its environmental record.  In the Q3 2022 earnings call, management addressed an environmental investigation by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection related to ash-basin closures at a retired coal-fired plant. These events underscore the importance of incorporating regulatory and environmental risks when assessing utility companies.

**Potential Catalysts**

{: .highlight }

> Beyond the previously mentioned catalysts, PPL’s business model is robust, and there is the potential for improved performance in the U.K. segment as the company works to reduce costs and streamline operations.  If the company can successfully execute its cost-cutting and growth strategies in both segments, it could result in positive stock price movement.

> Favorable outcomes in regulatory decisions can drive upside as regulatory uncertainty is still overhanging PPL. A positive outcome for LG&E and KU would help lower business risk. (2023 10K)

> Improving the balance sheet by deleveraging could also create upside potential, as it would lower financial risk and make the company more attractive to investors. (See *Capital Structure*, Exhibit 23.2)

> In the Q2 2023 Earnings call, Vincent Sorgi discussed the sale of Western Power Distribution (WPD) to National Grid USA and the acquisition of The Narragansett Electric Company.  Further, in the Q4 2023 Earnings call, Sorgi discussed the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy and its affiliates.  These transactions were presented as adding significant operational improvements and efficiency gains. If these synergies are realized, they could serve as a catalyst for growth.  

> Further,  in the Q2 2023 earnings call, Sorgi discussed the  ongoing regulatory review of Kentucky Utilities Company (KU) and Louisville Gas and Electric Company (LG&E).  If these regulatory decisions are favorable, this would lower uncertainty associated with these operations.
