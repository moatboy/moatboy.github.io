{: .highlight }
IBTX's business is fundamentally about gathering deposits and lending money at a spread, a fairly common model. However, the bank's strategic choices and customer niches create complexities that affect its ability to create and sustain value.

### Business Overview

**Revenue Streams:**
IBTX's revenues are primarily derived from interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and that paid on deposits and other borrowings. Additionally, the bank generates revenue from fees and commissions related to its services, including wealth management and transaction-based activities. More specifically, net interest income is a key driver, as is the spread the bank is able to make between interest earned and interest paid.  
Other sources of income include those from wealth management and from mortgage banking.
*Interest Income:* This is the net result of interest rate management between the company's assets and liabilities. The bank borrows from customers through deposits, then lends it out to others. The bank profits from the spread between the interest rate it charges for loans versus interest rate it pays for deposits.
*Fee and Commission Income:* This is income the bank makes from services that it provides such as wealth management, insurance, and other types of non-interest income.
*Other Income:* Includes income from gains on the sale of assets, investment gains, and any other income.

**Industry Trends:**
The banking industry has seen significant changes lately, including increased interest rates and shifts in customer behavior, and high competition.
*Interest Rate Environment:* Rising interest rates typically increase a bank's interest income, but also increase the cost of deposits. It can be tricky for banks to stay ahead of that.
*Competition:* The banking sector in IBTX's regions is competitive, with both national and local institutions vying for the same customers, as well as fintech companies. This means that IBTX has to work really hard to stand out.
*Customer Preferences:* Customer preferences are changing, with a rising demand for digital services and a more personalized banking experience.
*Consolidation: *The trend of banks consolidating with other banks or being acquired by bigger players is a thing to look out for. As well, banks are often acquiring niche companies to broaden their offering in products.
*Regional Differences:* Because the company is mainly in Texas and Colorado, it is important to understand economic conditions and regulatory requirements in those states, which are going to be different from other locations.

**Margins:**
IBTX's profitability is driven by its ability to maintain healthy net interest margins (NIM), which is the spread between what the bank earns on its loans compared to what it pays for its deposits. Operating margins are dependent on the operating costs.

**Competitive Landscape:**
IBTX competes with a diverse range of financial institutions, including large national banks, regional banks, credit unions, and fintech companies. 
*Large National Banks:* These have much bigger balance sheets and more resources and often invest more in technology to get an edge.
*Regional Banks:* Also have a similar business model, with the biggest differences being in scope and the way that they target their customers.
*Credit Unions:* Often have lower cost-structure and some tax advantages that give them an edge.
*Fintech Companies:* These are nimble, innovative and focus on the tech side of banking. Many fintechs focus on niche areas. IBTX has to stay on its toes.

**What Makes IBTX Different:**
The company tries to differentiate itself by providing more personalized financial services with a community focus. This may be a strength in some local communities. The bank also offers a wide range of financial services from basic banking, to private banking, to wealth management.
*Local Focus:* The company tries to emphasize its local presence and commitment to the communities that they serve, providing a "Main Street" service.
*Relationship Banking:* The bank attempts to create a solid relationship with the customer as they go through their banking and wealth management needs.
*Digital Offering:* IBTX is investing in its digital presence and tries to be on par with competitors.

### Financial Analysis
  

**Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5**
The balance sheet of IBTX appears to be generally healthy, but some areas require particular consideration.
*Liquidity* IBTX has good liquidity with cash and other liquid assets that are large enough to help it with any upcoming needs. The company has the resources to meet its short-term obligations.
*Capitalization* The company’s capitalization is pretty strong; there is a good amount of equity on the books to protect against losses and unexpected events.
*Asset Quality*  IBTX has been improving its asset quality and has a solid level of loan loss reserves. This indicates some awareness of bad loans. However, its nonperforming loans are still fairly significant, which must be monitored in the upcoming reports. 
*Leverage:* Leverage is okay at current levels, but it is important that the bank doesn't get too highly leveraged.

{: .note }
It should be pointed out that like most bank balance sheets, parts of the debt in this report could be at risk should the company have issues.

**Profitability & Earnings Analysis:**
IBTX has struggled to show consistency in its profitability in recent years. However, certain improvements seem to be on the horizon.
*Net Interest Margin (NIM):* NIM in 2022 was great and the highest that it has been in years. Recently, the rising interest rate environment has started to have an effect. NIM is beginning to plateau and management expects for it to fall throughout the coming periods.
*Loan Growth and Deposits:* Growth in both loans and deposits has been consistent. 
*Fee Income:* As shown in reports, fee and service income have increased. The company's wealth management division has also seen increased demand.
*Cost Control:* The management has taken steps to control expenses, however, they have been higher in certain recent reporting periods. This should be taken seriously.

{: .warning }
The management of IBTX has noted in recent earnings calls that margins have peaked and that they will decline in the coming reporting periods. This is in part due to the rapid increase in interest rates. The company has to ensure that its deposit costs do not rise too rapidly, which will impact NIM.

**Capital Allocation:**
The company also states that it has no current or planned acquisitions or buybacks.

**Understandability: 2 / 5**
IBTX is complicated to understand for the average investor for the following reasons:
*Complex financials:* The banking industry is more complex than most. The balance sheet is not easy to understand and requires an in-depth knowledge of things like the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), NIM, and credit risks.
*Industry-Specific Terms:* Certain banking terms aren't understandable to a casual investor.
*Non-standard accounting:* Accounting rules make it hard to understand whether a bank is actually creating value or not. Accounting also makes it hard to compare banks with other industries.
*Business dynamics:* The business model is straightforward—borrow money and lend it out—but the intricacies of making a profit in this field are not easy to understand. This is impacted by interest rates, regulations, and risks.
*Evolving Environment:* Changes in interest rates and consumer behavior make the analysis even more challenging.

**Moat Assessment: 2 / 5**

IBTX has only limited sustainable competitive advantages, or a moat. The following points support this conclusion:

*Switching costs:* The switching costs for bank clients have increased over time.
*Local Knowledge:*  IBTX's expertise and understanding of local economies can sometimes create a temporary local edge. However, these aren't permanent competitive advantages, as competitors may also be able to acquire this edge.
*Scale:* The company is relatively small and as a result does not have any economies of scale.
*Brand:* It has a moderate brand loyalty, but this isn't much of an edge.
*Intangible Assets:* The company does not have any proprietary technology or unique intellectual property.
The core reason why IBTX's moat is rated low is because most of the company's perceived strengths are quite easy to copy.

**Risks to the Moat and Business Resilience:**
IBTX faces the following risks that could weaken its competitive position:
*Economic cycles:* The bank's profitability is tied to the broader economic cycle. If there is an economic downturn, then loan defaults will increase and there will be less demand for the bank’s services, reducing profitability.
*Interest-rate risk:* The company could be severely harmed by rapid interest-rate shifts, especially if its deposit rate rises much more than the rate it charges for loans. This would compress margins, putting the company in a weak position.
*Regulatory changes:* The banking industry is regulated and laws can change which would affect IBTX's business.
*Increased Competition:* Increased competition from the larger banks and from fintechs may eat into its profitability.
*Geographical Risk:* Because most operations are limited to certain areas, any negative trend in those areas would affect the company much more than it would a company that was more diverse.
*Credit Risks:* There is always the risk of loans defaulting, and this can lead to increased operating costs.

**Business Resilience:**
Despite all of the risks that IBTX faces, the company can show the following reasons why it is resilient:
*Conservative lending practices:* The bank follows generally strict lending standards. This will protect it from losses during economic downturns.
*Diversified customer base:* The bank is also diversified across a number of business lines and it also has many customers.
*Experienced Management:* Leadership has experience in dealing with turbulent periods in the financial system.

In conclusion, IBTX is a regional bank that provides a wide array of services, but it has to constantly fight to retain its edge. The bank has some solid factors that provide its business resilience, but it is exposed to certain risks. To become a true leader, IBTX must focus on creating a sustainable competitive advantage by leveraging its local connections and by growing in its high-yield divisions.
