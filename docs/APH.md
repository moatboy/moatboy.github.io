{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution (2022):**  The company operates globally, with a significant portion of its revenues derived from the United States (53%), followed by the Asia-Pacific region (26%), and Europe (21%).  Within these regions, it serves a diverse set of industries, making it less dependent on any single customer or industry.  Amphenol provides more details in its annual and quarterly reports, which can be found on the company website and on the SEC website.
* **Industry Trends:** The connector industry is characterized by intense competition, innovation, and consolidation.  The increasing demand for electronic devices and systems is driving growth, but technological advancements and customer preferences are constantly evolving.  Amphenol has been able to adapt by developing new products and expanding into new markets, but maintaining high margins and returns will require continued effort and vigilance.  More details can be found in the Morgan Stanley report on industry dynamics.
* **Margins:** Amphenol typically generates operating margins of around 20%. Although the company did experience some margin contraction in the earlier part of this decade, its gross and operating margins have recovered significantly in recent years. It remains to be seen whether the company can maintain these levels as competition intensifies and commodity prices fluctuate.

**Moat Analysis**

Amphenol's moat stems from a combination of factors, although none individually are insurmountable. It is important to take a skeptical view and not overstate the moat's strength, as the company operates in a competitive environment.

1. **Intangible Assets (Brand):**  Amphenol benefits from a strong brand name, particularly within certain niche markets. While not as powerful as a consumer brand, it does convey a degree of quality and reliability, giving the company some pricing power.  However, this is not a major source of its moat, as the primary purchasing criteria in this industry are performance and price.
2. **Switching Costs:**  In some industrial applications, there are moderate switching costs associated with Amphenol's interconnect systems.  Changing suppliers can be disruptive and time-consuming, leading to some customer stickiness.  However, this effect is limited in many markets, particularly those with standardized products.
3. **Cost Advantages:** While the company may have some cost advantages stemming from its global manufacturing footprint, these are unlikely to be sustainable over the long run.  Competitors have access to similar low-cost manufacturing options, and any process-based cost advantages can be replicated.
4. **Network Effect:**  The network effect is not a significant factor for Amphenol.  The value of its products does not increase substantially with the number of users.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

Amphenol earns a 3/5 moat rating. Its brand name and switching costs contribute to the moat, but neither is a significant driver. While the company's financial performance has been strong historically, the competitive landscape and the ever-present risk of technological disruption require a cautious and skeptical outlook.

**Valuation**

The valuation is done using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, based upon the company's 2022 10K report. A five-year explicit forecast period was chosen given that Amphenol has been public for many decades. This allows for sufficient time to assess whether the company's historical performance represents a sustainable and predictable pattern.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  For the explicit forecast period, we have assumed 5.0% annual growth. This is a pessimistic number, a little below the company's average 7.2% growth rate over the preceding decade.
* **Operating Margin:** We assume a 20% operating margin, equal to the company's historical average.  Although margins did improve in recent years, we are taking a pessimistic view, given the competitive environment.
* **Sales/Invested Capital:** This is set at 1.75, which is the company's long-term average over the past 10 years. There is no reason to expect efficiency to increase in a competitive industry.
* **Tax Rate:**  We assume a tax rate of 25%, equal to the company's 2022 tax rate.
* **Cost of Capital:**
    * Risk-free rate: 4.0% (10-year US Treasury Bond rate as of December 2023)
    * Equity Risk Premium: 5.5% (historical average)
    * Beta: 1.23
    * Cost of Equity: 4% + 1.23 * 5.5% = 10.77%
    * Pretax cost of debt: 7.20% (estimated based on available credit spreads)
    * Effective tax rate: 25%
    * After-tax cost of debt = 7.20% * (1 - 0.25) = 5.40%
    * Target capital structure: 44.8% Debt/55.2% Equity (Market value-based)
    * WACC = 0.448 * 5.40% + 0.552 * 10.77% = 8.42%
{: .note }
* **Reinvestment Rate:** This is computed using the formula: Reinvestment Rate = Growth Rate / ROIC. This has been decreasing over time as growth has slowed for the company. It is assumed to trend from 115.7% in year 1 to 10% in year 10 and the perpetuity.

**Calculations:**

| Year | Revenue (\$ millions) | Operating Income (\$ millions) | Reinvestment | Free Cash Flow to Firm | Discount Factor | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $45,625 | $9,125 | $5,703 | $3,422 | 0.917 | $3,138 |
| 2 | $47,882 | $9,576 | $5,985 | $3,591 | 0.842 | $3,023 |
| 3 | $50,274 | $10,055 | $6,284 | $3,771 | 0.772 | $2,910 |
| 4 | $52,787 | $10,557 | $6,599 | $3,958 | 0.708 | $2,802 |
| 5 | $55,431 | $11,086 | $6,931 | $4,155 | 0.650 | $2,701 |


> **Terminal Value:**  We assume terminal growth will be equal to the risk-free rate of 4.00% and a return on new invested capital of 9% in perpetuity.
{: .note }
>

Terminal Value =  ($11,086 * (1-0.1) * 0.09)/ (0.0842-0.04)  = $24,901 million

Value of Operations = ∑ PV of yearly FCF + PV of Terminal Value = \$13,572 + $13,931 = $27,503 million

| Item | Value (\$ millions) |
|---|---|
| Cash | 441 |
| Minority interest | (469) |
| Debt | 19,412 |
| Non-operating assets | 8,877 |
| Value of Equity | $27,503+441-19,412+8,877-469 = $17,734 |


> **Shares Outstanding:** To determine Amphenol’s intrinsic value per share, divide its equity value by the number of shares outstanding (821 Million).

Intrinsic Value per Share = $17,734 million / 821 million = $21.60.

**Value Plays**

Amphenol's valuation is sensitive to growth and margin assumptions. If the company can maintain high margins and achieve moderate growth, it could be significantly undervalued.  However, given the competitive environment and the increasing importance of scale, it is likely that revenue growth will be in the low-to-mid single digits, and margin improvement may be limited.
