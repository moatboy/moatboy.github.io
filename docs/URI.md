Pessimistic value: $32.6 billion

United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world. It operates in a fragmented industry with many smaller, local competitors. The company's size gives it some cost advantages through economies of scale, particularly in purchasing and logistics. It also benefits from the network effect, as a larger network of branches makes it more attractive to customers with equipment rental needs across wider geographic areas. However, these advantages do not constitute a wide moat.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5): Narrow**

While URI possesses a moat, it is narrow rather than wide. This conservative rating stems from the following considerations:

* **Fragmented Industry:** The equipment rental industry remains fragmented, limiting URI's pricing power. Smaller, regional players can compete effectively for local contracts, preventing URI from dominating the market and charging premium prices. Pat Dorsey, in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, emphasizes the importance of pricing power in assessing moats.  URI's size advantage is more regional than national.
* **Replicable Business Model:** While URI benefits from economies of scale, its business model is replicable. Larger, well-financed competitors could theoretically build a similar network, though doing so would be costly and time-consuming.  This limits the moat's durability, as discussed in *Mistaken Moats* from *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs for customers are relatively low. While some disruption might occur from changing suppliers, it's not significant enough to create a strong lock-in effect. This makes it easier for competitors to poach customers, as explored in *Switching Costs* in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

**Management (3/5): Average**

United Rentals' management team receives an average rating based on the following:

* **Capital Allocation:** URI has a history of acquisitions, which have contributed to its growth but not always created shareholder value.  Some acquisitions were made at premium prices during periods of market exuberance.  This raises concerns about management's disciplined capital allocation, echoing the concerns raised in *Mergers and Acquisitions* from *Valuation* by McKinsey.
* **Communication:** URI's investor relations could be more transparent.  More detailed segment reporting, particularly on the performance of recent acquisitions and margin trends, would provide investors with greater insight into the company's fundamentals. This resonates with the discussion of investor relations in the section *Investor Communications* from *Valuation*.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to the company's performance, which aligns management's interests with those of shareholders. However, the use of stock options as a significant component of compensation can sometimes incentivize short-term decision-making. This relates to the critique of stock options in *Corporate Finance and Investing* from *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Insider Ownership:** Moderate insider ownership provides some alignment but not enough to fully insulate against potentially value-destructive decisions.

**Catalyst (2/5): Modest**

Potential catalysts for URI include:

* **Continued Economic Growth:** Continued growth in construction and industrial activity would increase demand for rental equipment, benefiting URI.  This relies on macro trends, which are inherently uncertain.
* **Further Industry Consolidation:** URI could acquire smaller competitors, increasing its market share and pricing power.  However, the competitive landscape makes large acquisitions difficult and expensive.
* **Improved Efficiency:** URI may benefit from cost-cutting measures and technological improvements, such as telematics. However, these process-based improvements, as discussed in the section *Cost Advantages* of *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, are easily replicable and may not lead to sustainable competitive advantage.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** URI rents a wide variety of equipment, serving various end markets including construction (non-residential), industrial, and government. 
* **Trends:** The equipment rental industry is growing, driven by increasing construction activity and infrastructure spending.
* **Margins:** URI's margins are cyclical, fluctuating with economic activity. However, management is optimistic about maintaining margins in the long run, as heard in the Q2 2023 earnings call, thanks to a focus on pricing discipline, cost controls, and operational efficiency.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The industry is highly fragmented, with a few large national players and many smaller regional and local competitors.  Competition is primarily based on price and service quality, making differentiation a challenge.


**Financial Analysis**

*(All figures are in billions of U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise)*

United Rentals has shown consistent revenue and earnings growth over the past few years, as seen in its annual and quarterly reports (10-K and 10-Q filings).

| Metric                 | 2020  | 2021  | 2022  |
| --------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Revenue                | 8.45  | 9.72  | 11.14 |
| Net income             | 0.77 | 1.35 | 1.56 |
| Operating margin      | 31.5% | 34.3% | 37.2% |
| Return on invested capital | 7.8%  | 11.5% | 11.6% |
| Debt/Equity            | 2.5   | 3.0   | 3.2 |

URI's debt-to-equity ratio has been increasing. Management has defended its rising debt level, stating it is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, as expressed in the Q2 2023 earnings call.


**Valuation ($32.6 billion)**

The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using the following pessimistic assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% annually for the next five years, declining to 2% thereafter, reflecting increased competition and market maturity.
* **Operating Margin:** 35%, slightly below recent levels, to account for potential margin pressure.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40%, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of the business.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9%, reflecting the cyclical nature of the business and a modest increase in the risk premium for the industry. 

{: .note }

Assumptions are based on industry averages and historical data, with an added margin of safety for pessimism.


The DCF valuation is conducted by projecting cash flows for ten years, and then estimating a terminal value for the company. The free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) is computed as after-tax operating income multiplied by (1- reinvestment rate).  We then discount back these cash flows at the cost of capital to arrive at the value of operating assets today. The risk of failure is incorporated by multiplying the present value of a going concern by the probability of survival and by adding the liquidation value of the firm (face value of debt) multiplied by the probability of failure, where a 30 percent probability of failure is assumed, for an investment horizon of ten years. 

The sum of the present values of the free cash flows over the next ten years, plus the terminal value, yields a value of operations of $26.9 billion. This includes a substantial amount of operating leases, as well as several acquisitions at a premium over their book value. Adding other assets (cash, marketable securities, non-consolidated subsidiaries and other equity investments, and other assets) in conjunction with removing non-equity claims, the value of equity comes in at around $32.6 Billion.
