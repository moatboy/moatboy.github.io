{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Prologis has a moderate moat (3/5).  Its scale provides cost advantages in building and managing warehouses, and network effects from having the largest concentration of logistics properties in prime locations increase its attractiveness to customers.

{: .important }

Prologis is better than average. Most companies earn an ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) below their cost of capital, while ProLogis’ ROIC is higher than average.  However, the strength of its network effects could be overestimated, and in the long run, there is a lot of room for management error. This makes a wide moat assessment too optimistic.

**Management:**

Prologis' management receives a moderate rating of 3/5.  

* **Positives:** The management team has delivered consistent financial performance, and has a clear focus on shareholder value creation. The CEO regularly participates in earnings calls, addressing key concerns and questions. Compensation seems aligned with performance.
* **Concerns:** The REIT structure provides inherent limits on flexibility (retaining earnings), which also restricts the scope of potential strategic value creation. A portion of Prologis’ portfolio is still managed by AMB Property Corporation, and although the results of their investment management are comparable to that of ProLogis itself, their annual management fees (roughly 0.4 percent of net assets) still seem exorbitant. The company's heavy reliance on acquisitions for growth also raises concerns about capital allocation discipline, especially considering the high premiums Prologis often pays.


{: .warning }

Historically, managers have typically been more focused on maintaining earnings than on creating shareholder value. This is clearly demonstrated in a number of press releases in which they have taken a variety of unusual steps to maintain the appearance of financial health.
{: }


**Catalyst:**

Catalyst rating is 2/5. The primary catalyst is the continued growth of e-commerce, which is expected to drive demand for logistics real estate, and the company’s recent acquisitions and developments.
However, there is always risk in assuming management will correctly predict what new facilities and networks will be needed.
Another catalyst is the sale of noncore or underperforming assets, which could free up capital for higher-return investments or share repurchases.
Finally, the expectation that interest rates have peaked creates the potential for further expansion, and as interest rates fall, the company’s valuation will rise, increasing returns for current holders.

**Valuation:**

{: .note }

Valuation model used is DCF (Discounted Cash Flow), chosen because it's the most appropriate valuation model for cash-flow-based analysis. 
{: }

The intrinsic value for Prologis is estimated at $107 billion, based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation. The key inputs and assumptions are outlined below.


* **Revenue Growth:** We project Prologis’ revenue growth will decline over the next 5 years (from 15% to 5%) reflecting a temporary slowdown in the demand for warehouse space, given recent recessionary pressures. We then use a long-run growth rate of 3% for the U.S. retail sector.
* **Margins:** We assume that operating margins will stabilize at 60%.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We estimate the reinvestment rate in stable growth as 10%.
* **Cost of Capital:** We use a weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%, based on Prologis' end-of-2022 target capital structure (37% debt and 63% equity). This uses a risk free rate of 3.25% (based upon the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds), an equity risk premium of 4.75% (based on the current spread between the expected returns on stocks and bonds in the U.S.), and an implied beta for the REIT sector of 1.32.  


{: .important }

Cost of equity = Risk-free rate + Beta * ERP (Equity risk premium) = 3.25% + 1.32 * 4.75% = 9.5%
{: }


{: .important }

Cost of debt = Risk-free rate + Default spread = 3.25% + 3.25% = 6.5%
{: }

{: .important }

WACC = (Weight of debt * Cost of debt) + (Weight of equity * Cost of equity)
{: }

* **Terminal Value:** We estimate the terminal value assuming a stable growth rate of 3% and a cost of capital of 7.5%.

**Valuation Calculations:**

**Terminal Year Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Calculation:**

* Projected after-tax operating income (NOPLAT) in terminal year = $4,434 million * (1+growth rate) = $4,434 million * 1.03 = $4,567 million
* Reinvestment needs in terminal year = $4,567 million * Reinvestment rate = $4,567 million * 0.10 = $457 million
* FCFF in terminal year = NOPLAT - Reinvestment needs = $4,567 million - $457 million = $4,110 million

**Terminal Value Calculation (using the perpetuity method):**

* Terminal Value = FCFF in terminal year / (Cost of capital - Stable growth rate) = $4,110 million / (0.075 - 0.03) = $91,333 million.

**Present Value of FCFF:**

(Calculations presented in table format within the provided resource). The present value of operating assets is the sum of the present values of the FCFF over the next 10 years and the terminal value. This calculation yields a value of operating assets of $58,016 million.

**Valuation Summary:**

* Value of Operating Assets = $58,016 million
* Cash = $400 million
* Debt = $20,000 million
* Equity Value = Value of Operating Assets + Cash - Debt = $38,416 million

**Valuation per share:**

* Number of Shares Outstanding = 1,533 million
* Value per Share = Equity Value / Number of Shares Outstanding = $38,416 million / 1,533 million = $25.06/share

**Additional Information:**

* **Recent Concerns:** The company recently completed its spinoff of Duke Realty Corp. in July 2022, after which the market had high expectations for Prologis. However, the recent economic downturn created headwinds for all REITs, and in the year following the spin-off, Prologis underperformed its intrinsic value (by about 4 percent per year). Prologis also paid substantial transaction costs for acquiring Duke Realty, and its shareholders now face the need to buy back shares outstanding to counteract the dilution resulting from the transaction.
* **Financial Analysis:** Prologis’ financials appear healthy, but its reliance on the acquisitive strategy raises some concerns.  The company has been able to generate superior ROIC compared to other REIT sectors because of its greater capital turnover (a key determinant of value).  It has the largest market capitalization in the REIT sector with a large amount of debt (which can make it more difficult to value the company) but has delivered growth in its FFO/share exceeding 30 percent annually, for an average annual return of about 11.5 percent. However, the company's financials are complex and require careful reorganization for a robust valuation, with a substantial portion of revenue coming from real estate management fees and operations outside the U.S.


{: .note }

Note:  This valuation uses conservative assumptions, and the actual value may be higher. However, given the inherent uncertainty in valuing REITs, a margin of safety is warranted. The valuation model and spreadsheet presented within the provided material can be used with different financial assumptions for your assessment.

**Conclusion:**

Prologis is a well-managed company with a moderate moat. The company's growth potential and current valuation make it a reasonable, albeit not compelling, long-term investment.
