>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Thomson Reuters' moat stems primarily from **switching costs** and **intangible assets (brands)**.  These factors are present in varying degrees across its business segments. 

* **Legal Professionals:** The legal segment benefits from high switching costs.  Once a law firm integrates Thomson Reuters' solutions (Westlaw, Practical Law) into its workflow, the cost and disruption of switching to a competitor are significant.  This is similar to the example provided in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth" regarding QuickBooks and TurboTax, where embedded data and tight integration with a customer’s business create substantial switching costs. The brand recognition of Westlaw also provides an intangible asset, although the importance of brand diminishes as expertise grows.
* **Tax & Accounting Professionals:**  Similar to the legal segment, switching costs exist for tax and accounting professionals using ONESOURCE and Checkpoint, though these are likely somewhat lower than for legal professionals. Brand strength is also present, although not as powerful as in the legal segment.
* **Government, Media, and Corporations:** These segments face more intense competition and exhibit lower switching costs, weakening the moat.

{: .important }

Overall, while the company benefits from switching costs and brand recognition in some of its key segments, the increasing availability of alternative solutions, modular software offerings, and the lower switching costs in other segments constrain its moat to a rating of 2.  Its moat is not wide enough to prevent increased price competition and the resulting lower returns on capital, as pointed out by Buffet. The shift to lower switching cost products is mentioned in the Damodaran presentation.
 

**Management (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:**  Thomson Reuters has a long history, but its track record since the Thomson-Reuters merger in 2008 has been mixed. The company has faced challenges in integrating acquired companies and adapting to changes in its customer and technological landscape. They did manage to spin off the Refinitiv segment successfully, which can be considered a positive.
* **Compensation:** Management compensation is largely tied to earnings per share (EPS) and annual turnover. While there is mention of ROIC targets, actual compensation details are not sufficiently disclosed in the annual report to provide a clearer picture of management’s focus.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership, including share ownership by directors and officers, is relatively low, decreasing the confidence about owner-like thinking in the company.
* **Communication:** While investor relations are available, the company does not provide enough detailed financials about its various segments to permit a robust, external assessment of how value is being created in its businesses. There is a mention of this in the Damodaran presentation.
* **Capital Allocation:** The company has made both value-creating (Refinitiv spin-off) and value-destroying acquisitions (several smaller acquisitions have produced subpar returns).  There has also been a trend of share buybacks, but it's not clear whether those were timed optimally.

{: .warning }

Overall, management earns a rating of 3 out of 5.  The mixed performance, low insider ownership, and relatively low degree of transparency are concerns. Recent share buybacks done in the face of potential acquisitions mentioned in the 2023 Q1 earnings call, could have been timed a bit better.
 

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Platform Consolidation:** There is potential for revenue synergies from recent acquisition and divestiture, but the timeline and magnitude of these synergies are uncertain. This has been discussed in the 2023 Q1 earnings call.
* **Product Innovation:**  The company has launched new products and services (e.g., Westlaw Edge), but the ability of these offerings to drive substantial revenue growth remains to be seen.

{: .note }

Overall, the catalyst rating is 2 out of 5.  While some catalysts exist, there is no compelling reason to expect a near-term, substantial increase in share price.


**Business and Financials:**

Thomson Reuters operates in several segments, serving legal, tax & accounting, government, media, and corporate customers. Its revenues are diverse across business segments and geographies. Recurring revenues represent a significant portion of its overall revenues and provide a baseline stability. Profitability metrics (operating margins, returns on capital) have shown modest improvements in recent years due to cost-cutting and efficiency measures mentioned in the 2023 Q1 earnings call, but they remain slightly below industry averages. The industry is currently experiencing industry consolidation, discussed in the Morgan Stanley report, and Thomson Reuters has made some sizeable acquisitions in the recent past to increase its scale and competitiveness in the evolving industry landscape.

{: .highlight }

There has been a trend towards organic revenue growth, but much of TRI’s growth has been fueled by acquisitions. The company uses some debt, which it has been trying to lower gradually. 



**Valuation ($57 billion):**

We will perform a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation to arrive at an intrinsic value for TRI. The valuation approach, detailed in chapter 6 of Koller et al.'s "Valuation", is as follows:

1. **Forecast free cash flow (FCF):**  We forecast free cash flow to the firm for the next 10 years. Revenue growth for Thomson Reuters has been growing at approximately 1.4%. Margins have been expanding from 14 to 16% as per the 2023 Annual report. Incorporating the recent acquisition of Casetext and the spin off of LSEG mentioned in the Q1 2023 earnings call, we assume a base case revenue growth rate of 2 percent annually for the first five years, declining to the risk-free rate (3%) at a rate of 0.5% over the following 5 years, and continuing this rate in perpetuity. We also assume that operating margins will continue to increase and stabilize around 20%. We also assume reinvestment will decline from approximately 70% to 10% during these 10 years.


2. **Estimate cost of capital:** Thomson Reuters's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated to be 9 percent. Cost of equity is determined as risk-free rate plus beta times risk premium. Considering the company's current bond rating of 'A' by Moody’s and S&P, the risk free rate is at 3.5%, beta is at 1.1, and the market risk premium is at 4.5%. These numbers are obtained from Aswath Damodaran’s recent estimates (for risk-free rate, market risk premium, and betas). This is in line with what Burry did for valuation for eToys and other companies in 2000. For a more detailed discussion, please see Koller et al.'s discussion of WACC estimation in "Valuation". Based on these inputs, cost of equity is estimated at 8.5%. We then use the interest rates implied by its outstanding corporate bonds to obtain pretax cost of debt (roughly 4.5%), incorporate marginal tax rate (25%) for the combined businesses which can be obtained from company’s 10-K to obtain after-tax cost of debt and then use target capital structure to obtain the WACC (around 9%). These estimations are illustrated in Chapter 11 of "Valuation".


3. **Calculate terminal value:** We estimate a terminal value at the end of year 10, assuming a perpetual growth rate of 3 percent and a WACC of 9 percent.  This implies a continuing growth in free cash flow to the firm. As per the previous assumptions of ROIC declining to cost of capital in perpetuity, this is a conservative assumption.


4. **Discount cash flows and terminal value:**  We discount the projected free cash flows and the terminal value back to the present at the WACC.
.
Adding these up yields a DCF firm value of approximately $72 billion.

5. **Make adjustments to arrive at equity value per share**: Subtracting net debt ($15 billion) and adding back non operating assets ($3 billion) and dividing by number of diluted shares outstanding (approximately 0.75 billion) yields an estimated value of $80 per share.

{: .important }

This valuation assumes continued stable business performance and modest growth. Given the mature nature of the business and intense competition in some of its markets, these assumptions are optimistic.  Furthermore, given the current macroeconomic uncertainties mentioned in TRI’s Q4 2022 Earnings call and the mixed capital allocation decisions of management's past, there is a wider range of possible outcomes, so we applied a discount of 15% to arrive at a value per share of $70. Multiplying by number of shares, we arrive at an approximate market cap of $57 Billion.


**Overall:**

Thomson Reuters is a company with strong brands, sticky customers, and improving financials, but faces increasing competition and ongoing industry disruption. The current valuation appears reasonably in line with its fundamentals, but there is no substantial margin of safety.  There has recently been an activist investor calling for a breakup of the company, which adds to uncertainty but could also be a potential catalyst for value creation if handled correctly as was mentioned in the Q4 2022 Earnings call.
