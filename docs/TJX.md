>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** TJX generates the majority of its revenue in the U.S. (approximately 80%), with the remaining revenue coming from Canada and International segments, split equally between Europe and Australia. The company owns over 4,800 stores worldwide, including 1,350 in the U.S.
* **Industry Trends:** The off-price retail industry is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share, but the industry is in a relatively mature state. Industry revenues have remained relatively stable over the last few years despite pandemic-related disruptions in 2020 and 2021, the industry is slowly beginning to consolidate. This consolidation is driven by several factors, including consumer preference for established brand names, economies of scale in advertising and logistics, increased product variety, the convenience offered by online sales, and the low relative pricing of off-price retailers compared to their competitors.
* **Margins:** TJX has maintained relatively stable margins over the years, with a gross margin of 29% and an operating margin of 10%.
* **Capital Expenditures:** The company has moderate capital expenditures, primarily for new store openings and renovations, and technology improvements.

**Moat Analysis**

TJX's moat rests primarily on two pillars:

1. **Cost advantages:** TJX sources its merchandise from over 21,000 vendors and leverages its significant buying power to negotiate lower prices and favorable payment terms. This allows the company to offer products at a discount compared to traditional retailers, appealing to value-conscious consumers. 

2. **Brand intangible:** While TJX sells branded merchandise, its business model derives customer value from its curation and treasure-hunt shopping experience. This is a intangible asset related to the value provided by the "off-price" business model, where consumers derive value from getting branded items at discounts and enjoy the search aspect of the shopping experience.

However, these advantages are not as strong as some other businesses with wider moats.

* **Cost advantages:** While TJX has substantial buying power, its cost advantages are susceptible to erosion. There is nothing unique or difficult to replicate about its off-price business model, and other players, even online players, can emulate it. Online companies offering deep discounts on a wide array of merchandise often benefit from not needing physical stores, trucks, and so forth. Online off-price retailers often have an advantage over brick-and-mortar off-price retailers because of higher margins. A continued rise in online off-price retailing poses a threat to its business. Additionally, as the off-price retail industry consolidates, competition may intensify, putting downward pressure on margins.

* **Brand intangible:** While TJX’s brands are well-recognized and have a loyal customer base, the branding itself is not unique to the company’s products since its merchandise is sourced from other companies, reducing the switching costs that customers face. Consequently, customers are not necessarily tied to a particular off-price retailer. The popularity of a brand translates into pricing power for the products themselves, not the companies selling the products. The popularity of TJX brands is not a reliable measure of moat.

>**Moat Rating Justification:** Due to the aforementioned limitations, TJX's moat is rated as **2 out of 5**. The moat is narrow and arguably declining, with cost advantages and brand advantages not translating into sufficient pricing power or sustainable high returns on capital.

**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation was performed using TJX's financial statements from the past three years (fiscal years 2020-2022), with a pessimistic outlook and conservative assumptions.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% annual growth for the next 5 years, declining to 1% in perpetuity (below expected inflation). Given intensifying online competition and a relatively mature state of the industry, a pessimistic revenue growth projection is being applied here.
* **Operating Margin:** 10% (stable). No improvement in margin is being assumed, given the competitive pressures.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 30% for the next five years. The reinvestment rate is calculated by dividing the change in invested capital (IC) by the after-tax operating income each year. This would mean that TJX is reinvesting substantially in its business. A reinvestment rate of 25 percent may be more appropriate in light of its substantial capacity and brand name. However, for a valuation-as a basis for a margin of safety, this higher reinvestment rate seems appropriate.
* **Cost of Capital:** 9%  The current ten-year U.S. treasury bond rate is 4.1%.  We'll add a market risk premium of 4.5%, making 8.6%. TJX has a tax rate of 25%, but the tax savings rate of 20% is used because the interest coverage ratio of 12 is assumed to be maintained.
WACC = 4.48% * .17 + 8.6% * .83 = 7.9%
* **Terminal Value:** The terminal value assumes a 1% rate of growth for perpetuity, with a return on equity of 7%, in line with the current risk-free rates. A lower long-term return on capital was applied given its narrow moat.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** FCF is projected for the next 10 years, and subsequently the terminal value is obtained, assuming a constant 1% annual growth beyond year 10. (See Appendix for detailed calculations)
2. **Present Value of FCF:** Each year's FCF is discounted back to its present value using the cost of capital (9%).
3. **Enterprise Value (EV):** The sum of the present values of the FCFs plus the terminal value gives the enterprise value.
4. **Equity Value:** Net debt, minority interests, and other non-equity claims (assuming they exist and can be quantified) are subtracted from the enterprise value to arrive at the market value of equity.
5. **Fair Value per Share:** The market value of equity is divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding to arrive at the estimated fair value per share.

**Valuation Results:**

Based on these assumptions, the estimated fair value of TJX is **$82.2 billion**, or **$68.13** per share.

>**Fair Value Discussion:** This valuation is based on pessimistic, but plausible, assumptions. Any improvement in long-term growth or margins would increase the fair value, and vice versa. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and competitive pressures, this conservative valuation seems appropriate. While the recent stock price exceeds this fair value by a small amount, this price reflects investor optimism about continuing strong growth, which is not justified given company’s narrow and arguably declining moat.
