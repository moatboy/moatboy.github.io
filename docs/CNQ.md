{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

CNQ benefits from some cost advantages stemming from its ownership of long-life, low-decline assets, particularly in its oil sands operations.  These resources offer a certain level of cost advantage, as noted in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth" and "Valuation," as the cost of bringing additional barrels to production is lower than finding and developing a new resource.

However, the moat is narrow. The book highlights the importance of industry structure in creating durable competitive advantages.  The oil and gas industry is inherently cyclical and commodity-driven, limiting pricing power as discussed in "The Little Book of Valuation."  While CNQ's reserves enhance its longevity, the company remains exposed to commodity price fluctuations, as highlighted in the company's 2022 AIF. Consequently, competition to acquire and develop these assets, including technological improvements,  can reduce the company's cost advantage over time, further narrowing its moat, as noted in the provided Morgan Stanley report on industry analysis. I am therefore rating the company as having a weak narrow moat.

**Management (3/5):**

CNQ's management team demonstrates a mixed record.

* **Positives:** The company has consistently paid and raised its dividend over time (as evidenced in its "Dividend History"), a shareholder-friendly move highlighted in Graham's "The Intelligent Investor." The company also seems to make rational capital allocation decisions. During the 2023 Q3 earnings call, management reaffirmed its capital allocation priorities as balancing shareholder returns, the balance sheet, and future growth through organic opportunities and opportunistic acquisitions. Management has also been focused on returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. In 2023 alone, CNQ paid $4.60 per share in dividends and bought back shares worth approximately $1.05 Billion.  This approach aligns with the owner-oriented approach advocated by Buffet, as detailed in "The Essays of Warren Buffet."

* **Negatives:**  While the company owns long-life, low-decline assets,  historical returns on invested capital, though respectable, have not been outstanding when compared to those of its best peers in the industry (e.g., Exxon), as highlighted in the provided resources.
While Tim Mckay had significant insider ownership of the company during his tenure as President and CEO,  insider ownership is now a negligible fraction for all board members combined, at around 0.5% (obtained from the company's latest proxy statement). This raises concerns as high insider ownership can be a signal of management's alignment with shareholder interests, a theme emphasized in numerous investing books. Their communication, while seemingly transparent in financial reporting, lacks specifics on individual business units. Finally, management has a history of making large acquisitions (as detailed in its AIF), a growth strategy that often destroys value, as warned by McKinsey in "Valuation". 

**Catalyst (2/5):**

CNQ operates in a highly cyclical industry. As noted by Aswath Damodaran, cyclical companies are subject to macroeconomic factors and industry cycles, making their valuation more difficult and uncertain. Potential catalysts for share price appreciation include a sustained rise in oil and gas prices (although this is difficult to predict, as highlighted in the Michael Burry article) and successful execution of its strategic growth plans. These catalysts can significantly influence profitability, making them a medium-term driver of returns. 

**Business:**

CNQ operates in two main segments: Exploration & Production and Oil Sands Mining & Upgrading. The Exploration & Production segment focuses on conventional crude oil and natural gas, while the Oil Sands Mining & Upgrading segment focuses on bitumen production. The revenue mix within the business has changed significantly over the last few years, with Oil Sands becoming increasingly more prominent, as highlighted in the company's 2023 annual report.

CNQ’s largest geographical market is North America, generating the majority of its revenue, approximately 90% in 2023. Although the company has some international operations, the earnings power of these operations is smaller in comparison, which makes the company less exposed to country risk.

The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, and profit margins can vary significantly with commodity prices. CNQ's margins have been volatile in recent years, impacted by the cyclical nature of the industry, especially in its oil sands operations. As the industry matures and consolidates, competitive forces intensify, as discussed in the provided Morgan Stanley report. CNQ’s competitive advantage is driven primarily by lower costs and a larger scale of production relative to smaller competitors, along with its reserves as previously explained.

**Financials:**

CNQ's financials are heavily influenced by the prevailing oil and gas prices.  Over the past few years, the company has faced a period of low commodity prices and increasing production costs, as highlighted in its earnings calls throughout 2019-2021. This has impacted its profitability and cash flow generation, although it remained profitable and generated positive cash flow.  However, during the recent years since 2022, the company has had higher production and sales volumes, combined with higher product prices. As a result, the company's financial performance significantly improved. In 2023, CNQ generated approximately $8.5 billion in after-tax operating income from continuing operations.

{: .warning }

A key concern is the cyclical nature of the industry and the company's substantial debt load of approximately $12 billion, as reported in its 2023 consolidated balance sheet.  Given its history of acquisitions (as detailed in its AIF), there is a risk of overpaying for assets. This financial structure can amplify the downside during periods of low commodity prices, posing a risk to shareholder returns, as noted in Damodaran's "The Little Book of Valuation" and "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies." This is the one big risk to investors and the valuation, which has been mitigated using the scenarios discussed later.


**Valuation ($58.6 Billion):**

To value CNQ, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used based on its expected future free cash flow, as discussed in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies." The DCF valuation includes the following assumptions:

* **Revenue Growth:** For the first 10 years (2024-2033), revenue growth rate is forecasted to be the long-run historical average of real GDP (2.5%), in the following 5 years (2034-2038), revenue growth rate is assumed to gradually decrease to zero,  with revenue equal to 2023 revenue level in perpetuity beyond 2038. This approach accounts for the natural product life cycle for mature products as discussed in "Valuation" book and articles.
* **Margins:** 2023's operating margin will be maintained in the future, as justified by the company's 2023 AIF ("We will continue to drive our sustainable free cash flow... through our various business units."). Given stable long-run economic growth and the mature nature of CNQ's businesses, it is reasonable to assume that margins will also remain stable in the future.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** For growth years, I use the median reinvestment rate for the oil and gas producers over the past five years as seen in their statements. For stable growth years I calculate the reinvestment rate using a return on capital equal to WACC (as detailed in the section on "Estimating Continuing Value" in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies").
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  Based on a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity (obtained from the company's historical capital structure), an industry beta of 0.8 (calculated using the procedure outlined in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies" and Bloomberg terminal), a risk-free rate of 4% (using the 10-year U.S. government bond rate), and a risk premium of 4.5% (based on the historical returns for a long-run equity investor), the cost of equity is estimated at 7.6%.  The after-tax cost of debt is estimated at 3.2% based on a BB rating (using the 2023 May Credit Spreads table and applying a tax rate of 37%). The resulting WACC is 7.0%. This approach recognizes current market sentiment and industry averages.
* **Terminal Value:** The terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% consistent with economic growth, and a continuing value derived from an assumed return on capital equal to WACC. These conservative assumptions limit potential overvaluation, as emphasized in "Valuation".
* **Probability of Failure and Distress Sale Value:** A probability of failure of 2.5% (obtained from Moody's 10 year default probability using CNQ's BB+ rating) is assumed, consistent with an average rating for its bond issues. This recognizes the challenges of the commodity industry as discussed in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth". A distress sale value equal to 60% of book value of assets is assumed. I have taken this to be a lower estimate than the distress sale value of 75% often discussed in "Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies" to account for the low earnings, profitability and a possible sale amidst the crisis in the commodity industry.


| Year | Cash Flow | Cumulative Discount Factor | Present Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3576 | 0.935 | $3344 |
| 2 | $3928 | 0.873 | $3431 |
| 3 | $4301 | 0.816 | $3512 |
| 4 | $4687 | 0.763 | $3581 |
| 5 | $5088 | 0.713 | $3639 |
| 6 | $5437 | 0.666 | $3619 |
| 7 | $5731 | 0.623 | $3566 |
| 8 | $5971 | 0.582 | $3477 |
| 9 | $6156 | 0.544 | $3348 |
| 10 | $6286 | 0.508 | $3197 |
| Terminal Value |  | 0.508 | $35,135 |
| **Total** |  |  | **$51,640** |

Value of equity is obtained by adding back cash and other marketable securities ($877 million), deducting market value of debt ($12,110 million) and minority interest($29 million). Furthermore, since a portion of debt is already allocated in CNQ's business units, debt for the company needs to be calculated at an adjusted level. After adjustments for foreign exchange and net non-operating interest-bearing expenses, the adjusted net debt is $11.1 Billion. Deducting this value of debt from enterprise value and adding the value of non-operating assets gives an intrinsic equity value of $40.4 Billion. This value, divided by the number of shares outstanding (1.1 Billion, including dilution from options), results in a value of $36 per share.

**Overall Assessment:**

Despite its strong dividend policy and improving financials in the last two years, CNQ's valuation appears fully valued using a DCF model with reasonable assumptions and a moderate amount of pessimism baked in, based on Graham’s guidance in “The Intelligent Investor”.

{: .new }

Several uncertainties loom over the company's future, including the cyclical nature of the oil and gas market, the global economic outlook, and environmental regulations. These uncertainties justify the moderately pessimistic outlook in estimating the future profitability of the business and in choosing discount rates. As the market seems to be pricing in a better future for the company, I am being rather strict in my rating of their moat and management, as per Graham’s suggestion on being skeptical and avoiding any unjustifiable assumptions.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies/Problems:**

During recent years, CNQ has faced pressure from investors and regulatory bodies to reduce its environmental impact. The company has committed to reducing methane emissions intensity by 50% by 2026 and achieving net-zero methane emissions by 2030, as mentioned in its 2022-2023 MD&A. As highlighted in "Valuation", government policy can be the most important influence on investment decisions, particularly on industries like oil and gas.
During the 2020 Q2 conference call,  President Tim McKay addressed concerns about oil demand and production declines and emphasized the company’s focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Increased Production:** Successful execution of the company's strategic growth plans, particularly in the oil sands, and increased production volumes, and especially a shift in the product mix toward higher margin products would potentially enhance cash flows. However, as the "Little Book that Builds Wealth" emphasizes, growth for growth's sake can destroy value.
* **Cost Reduction:**  Continued focus on cost-cutting measures, particularly in its operating expenses, as discussed in the provided financial documents, could boost profitability.  As per "Valuation", cost advantage plays a key role in ensuring a firm maintains healthy profit margins.
* **Acquisitions:** Management aims at acquisitions that enhance the overall profitability of the company as mentioned in several conference calls over the years. The company also divests assets regularly.


I am giving the company a catalyst rating of 2 / 5. As highlighted in Micheal Burry's articles, commodity-driven companies are heavily dependent on macroeconomic conditions. Also, industry dynamics are a key element that determines company success as noted in "Valuation". Even though management has taken steps to enhance capital allocation, reduce costs, and pursue acquisitions, these catalysts are only moderately likely to materialize in a significant price increase given current prices, justifying the relatively low rating.
