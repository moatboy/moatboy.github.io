{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):** QSR’s moat primarily stems from its **brands** and **scale**. 

* **Brands:** Well-known brands like Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes confer some customer loyalty and pricing power, creating mini-monopolies in their respective niches (as described in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*). However, the power of these brands is constantly challenged by changing consumer tastes and new entrants. Brand loyalty in fast food is less durable than in other consumer categories. *As a thought experiment, consider how easily substitutable most fast-food offerings are.*
* **Scale:** QSR's large size provides cost advantages in procurement, advertising, and real estate, especially relative to smaller fast food retailers. Its franchise model creates additional scale advantages by leveraging franchisees' resources to open and operate restaurants.  *Thinking about moats, however, size alone is rarely enough; the company must translate size into an advantage in areas like cost, geography, process, or intangible assets (brand or patents)* (as mentioned in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*).  QSR's size advantage is more evident at the regional level rather than on the global scale where other large franchise chains such as McDonald's and Yum Brands operate.  *This is somewhat analogous to the niche market moats described in The Little Book That Builds Wealth,* where local scale can create barriers to entry, though at a more limited level than global players.  *Bigger can be better in this respect, but remember that scale advantages are not static.*  (as illustrated in *Valuation*). Globalization, technological change, and new industry structures can challenge or diminish them over time.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation:** QSR has engaged in acquisitions (Popeyes, Firehouse Subs) and refranchising, which *in theory* should improve efficiency and returns on capital.  However, the company has also taken on debt to fund acquisitions and share repurchases.  *Debt-fueled growth can put long-term value creation at risk* (as discussed in *Valuation* and *The Little Book of Valuation*).  *The financial crisis of 2007-2008 provided a clear illustration of this danger, as banks and other financial institutions were brought to their knees* (as described in *Valuation*). *Further, QSR's returns on invested capital have not shown a clear upward trend over time.*
* **Communication & Investor Relations:** QSR provides earnings guidance and reports quarterly earnings, *which is a common practice but not necessarily indicative of good long-term thinking.* (as noted in *Valuation*).  While management discusses “long-term” plans, *there is always a risk that they are more focused on hitting short-term earnings targets.* *Remember that most managers focus on the now (often measured on a quarterly basis), and shareholders ought to factor this into the valuation process.* (as discussed in *Valuation*). *Moreover, the emphasis on earnings and stock prices is generally not in the interests of shareholders but benefits Wall Street instead.* (as mentioned in *The Intelligent Investor*)
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to earnings and share performance.  *This can incentivize short-term thinking and manipulation of earnings.*  While some recent moves toward incorporating ESG metrics could be viewed positively, *it is important to track these measures over a period of time to assess their impact on long-term value creation.* *Remember that stock options, while seemingly an excellent incentive, sometimes backfire, and can give top managers an oversized claim on the upside for short-term accomplishments* (as mentioned in *The Essays of Warren Buffet*).
* **Insider Ownership:**  While the level of insider ownership is not disclosed in the provided documents, there are no red flags regarding insider buying or selling based on the news articles.
* **Overall:**  QSR's management appears competent in operating their franchises, but there is no clear evidence of exceptional long-term strategic vision. *Like a jockey, great management alone is not enough* (as stated in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*).  *Moats are the true source of long-term competitive advantages.*  *Great management needs a great company, or the results can be a disaster* (as warned in *The Intelligent Investor*).

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Menu Innovation and Promotions:** The fast-food industry is constantly evolving, and QSR needs to innovate to stay ahead of the competition. Successful new products and limited-time offers *could* drive sales and traffic in the near term. *It is worth noting, however, that the restaurant industry tends to be highly competitive and new products and promotions frequently fail to create long-term value.*
* **International Expansion:**  QSR has been expanding its presence in emerging markets.  While these markets offer growth potential, they also carry higher risk.  Successful execution in these markets *could* boost revenues and profits.  However, *international expansion is challenging* (as mentioned in *Valuation*) and execution has been uneven across emerging markets as revealed in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **Restaurant Remodels/Modernization:** Modernizing existing restaurants could attract new customers and improve the customer experience, potentially driving near-term sales growth.  This was discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **Overall:**  QSR faces multiple challenges including intensifying competition, changing consumer preferences, and economic uncertainty.  While menu innovation, international expansion, and restaurant remodels could be positive catalysts, their impact is uncertain.

**Valuation ($47.4 Billion):**

QSR's value depends on the sum of its future cash flows.  To estimate the intrinsic value of its equity, I performed a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation:

**Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Forecast Period:**  10 years, consistent with Damodaran's recommendation to forecast free cash flow for 10 years if uncertainty limits reasonable estimation beyond that period (as stated in *Little Book of Valuation*).
2. **Revenues:** Assumed 3% average annual revenue growth (slightly below historical average), reflecting the industry trend of slower growth (as noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call), the challenge of growth in mature markets (as noted in *The Little Book of Valuation*), and potentially negative impacts of macro conditions and intensifying competition.
3. **Operating Margin:**  Assumed gradual margin expansion from current levels of around 17% to a long-term margin of 22%. This incorporates ongoing cost efficiencies but reflects skepticism about significant margin improvement given intense competition.  *It is important to recognize that cost cutting is more easily done on paper than in practice.* (as mentioned in *The Little Book of Valuation*).
4. **Reinvestment Rate:** Assumed gradual decline in reinvestment rate from 67% to 45%, based on recent acquisitions and refranchising strategy to generate cash.
5. **Cost of Capital (WACC):**
    * Risk-Free Rate: 4%, based on current U.S. Treasury yields.  *A company's business creates value only if it's doing better than just storing a huge pile of money.*
    * Beta: 0.90 (conservative), recognizing some cyclicality of the fast-food sector.
    * Market Risk Premium: 5% (conservative) given elevated market valuations.
    * Cost of Debt: 5.5%, using RBI's bond yield (as per Q1 2023 earnings call).
    * Marginal Tax Rate: 25%.
    * Debt/Capital Ratio: 31% (conservative), based on the company's recent historical average but acknowledging management's target for higher leverage.
6. **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the stable growth perpetuity method, assuming a long-term growth rate of 2% and a cost of capital of 8% after year 10 (reflecting *the need for reinvestment to be less than the cost of equity* as described in *Little Book of Valuation* and *Valuation*), consistent with lower growth in a mature market (as presented in *Valuation*), and also reflecting the need to maintain its competitive advantages as mentioned in *Consistent Observer*.

**Results:**

The DCF valuation yielded an intrinsic value of **$47.4 billion** for the equity of QSR.  

{: .important }

**It is crucial to emphasize that valuation is a process, not an outcome.**  As stated in *The Intelligent Investor*, “The market is frequently efficient… but the real test of valuation is whether or not it guides your judgments about which securities are currently over- or under-priced.”  This valuation should be used as a starting point for further due diligence and analysis. 

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Inflationary Pressures:**  Rising input costs have been squeezing margins. Management addressed this issue in recent earnings calls (Q2 2023 and Q4 2022), expressing confidence in their ability to manage costs through pricing and operational efficiencies.  This is consistent with their long-term strategy as noted in annual reports and earnings calls.
* **Competition:**  The fast-food industry is intensely competitive. Management discussed their response to the intensifying competition from both existing and new entrants in the Q2 2023 earnings call, focusing on menu innovation, restaurant remodels, and digital initiatives.  

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Burger King Turnaround:** The Q2 2023 earnings call focused on the plan to revitalize the Burger King brand, with investments in advertising and restaurant modernization.  
* **Popeyes Growth:**  Popeyes is QSR's fastest-growing brand and continued menu innovation and international expansion could boost sales, though with increasing competition in several markets.  This was also mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
* **Digital Initiatives:**  QSR continues to invest in digital ordering and delivery platforms.  Success in this area *could* improve the customer experience and drive sales and operating performance, as revealed in the Q2 2023 earnings call.

**Catalyst Rating (2/5):**  

The catalysts *may* boost QSR's performance in the near term, but their long-term impact is less certain given the competitive landscape and macroeconomic uncertainty. 
{: .warning }

It's important to note that a catalyst is not simply good news, but an event that is likely to cause an upward reevaluation of the business and its intrinsic value.

**Additional Notes:**

* Restaurant Brands International was formed in 2014 through the merger of Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Tim Hortons Inc.
* The company operates primarily through a franchising model, limiting its direct control over operations at the local level and affecting how much it can generate in sales and revenues from restaurants.  *This fact must be incorporated into a DCF valuation.*
* Accounting for operating leases can distort the income statement and return on invested capital. 
* Financial reporting standards allow companies to exclude expenses, such as restructuring charges, from non-GAAP earnings, which can mislead investors.
* Management optimism about future growth *may not be realized.*
