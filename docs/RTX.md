* **Collins Aerospace:** Provides primarily commercial aircraft engines and related aftermarket services.
* **Pratt & Whitney:** Manufactures and services military and commercial aircraft engines and auxiliary power units.
* **Raytheon Intelligence & Space:**  Offers systems, software, and sensors for military, space, and other government and commercial needs.
* **Raytheon Missiles & Defense:** Develops and manufactures missile systems, precision weapons, and related technologies primarily for the U.S. government.

**Revenue Distribution (2022):**

* **Commercial Aerospace:**  ~56% (Collins Aerospace & Pratt and Whitney)
* **Defense:** ~44% (Raytheon Missiles & Defense & Raytheon Intelligence and Space)

**Industry Trends:**

The aerospace and defense industry is characterized by high barriers to entry due to substantial capital requirements, complex technologies, stringent regulatory frameworks, and long product development cycles. The industry is currently experiencing robust growth driven by increased defense spending globally and a recovery in commercial air travel following the pandemic. However, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and geopolitical tensions remain headwinds.

**Margins:**

RTX enjoys relatively stable operating margins, typically in the high teens, thanks to its strong market positions and long-term contracts in the defense segment. The commercial aerospace segment's margins tend to be more cyclical, reflecting the ups and downs of the commercial air travel cycle.

**Competitive Advantages (Moat):**

RTX derives its moat from a combination of factors, justifying a 3/5 rating:

1. **Intangible Assets:** Strong brand names (Pratt & Whitney, Collins Aerospace, Raytheon) carry significant weight in the aerospace industry. These brands represent quality, reliability, and technological leadership.  However, brand power is not absolute, as evidenced by the constant need for innovation and new product development to stay ahead of competitors.  Furthermore, government procurement processes often prioritize performance over brand, especially for mission-critical defense systems.

2. **Switching Costs:** High switching costs exist for customers using RTX's products.  Aircraft manufacturers and airlines are unlikely to switch engine suppliers or avionics systems easily, given the integration complexities and certification requirements. This “stickiness” creates a durable revenue stream and pricing power. However, competition for new aircraft platforms can be fierce, and government procurement agencies often negotiate aggressively to limit costs. 

3. **Cost Advantages:**  Scale economies play a role, particularly for Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, given the high fixed costs associated with engine manufacturing. Additionally, RTX benefits from the experience curve effects, particularly for long-production-run programs. However, disruptive innovation and competitive pressures can erode cost advantages over time.  Further, newer entrants often aggressively compete for contracts by undercutting legacy providers on price.  As a skeptic, the potential for cost advantages to be sustained indefinitely is limited.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

A rating of 3/5 reflects a reasonably strong but not impenetrable moat. While brand equity, switching costs, and economies of scale offer advantages, competition, government influence, and technological disruption pose persistent challenges.  A pessimistic viewpoint suggests that the durability of RTX's moat may be shorter than some might expect.

**Valuation (DCF Model with a Terminal Value)**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate the intrinsic value of RTX, using its consolidated financials from 2017-2022. We will adopt an enterprise DCF approach.  Given the uncertainties facing many mature businesses, we choose a forecast period of five years, which is long enough to capture short term trends and short enough to avoid excessive reliance on managerial projections.

**Key Assumptions:**

1. **Revenue Growth:** We assume that revenue growth for the next five years will decline gradually from 7% to 5%, assuming a gradual recovery from the pandemic along with a gradual slow down in growth.  Beyond year 5, we assume a stable growth rate of 3%, consistent with the long-run growth rate of the US economy.

2. **Margins:** We assume that operating margins (EBIT/Sales) will gradually improve by 0.5 percentage points per year through the forecast period to reach 19.5% in year 5.  Beyond year 5, we assume a stable margin of 19.5%.  

3. **Reinvestment:**  We estimate the reinvestment rate (Reinvestment/NOPAT) by using the revenue growth rates and return on new invested capital (RONIC) estimates, assuming a RONI of 12%.

4. **Cost of Capital:** We use a risk-free rate of 4%, a market risk premium of 5%, a beta of 1.0, and a marginal tax rate of 24%. We assume a target debt ratio of 15% and the resulting cost of capital equals 8.77%. For the terminal value, given RTX’s solid credit rating and the nature of its long-term contracts, we will be conservative and use a WACC of 8%, still in the ballpark of other defense businesses.


**Calculations:**

1. **NOPAT, FCFF, and ROIC:**  Based on RTX’s consolidated financial statements,  we reorganize the statements to clearly delineate operating versus financing items and calculate the historical NOPAT, FCFF, and ROIC.


2. **Forecasting:**  We project out revenue, operating income, reinvestment, taxes, after-tax operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital for the next five years based on the aforementioned assumptions. This includes accounting for RTX’s recent acquisition and divestiture activity as well as the impact of the pandemic and supply-chain issues.


3. **Terminal Value:** Beyond year 5, we estimate the terminal value of RTX assuming a steady state growth rate of 3% and a cost of capital of 8%, both being conservative assumptions.

 Terminal Value = (FCFF<sub>Year 6</sub>) / (Cost of Capital – Stable Growth Rate)
 Terminal Value = ($7,705)(1.03) / (0.08 - 0.03) = $158,897 million

4. **Present Value:** We discount the projected free cash flows and the terminal value back to the present at the cost of capital of 8.77%.  The sum of the present values of the free cash flows over the explicit forecast period and the continuing value yields the value of the operations. The present value of the operating assets is estimated to be around $132 billion.

5. **Nonoperating Assets:** We value excess cash, marketable securities, and any other nonoperating assets separately by applying a conservative multiple. Based on RTX’s current holdings, we estimate a value of nonoperating assets of approximately $5.5 billion.

6. **Debt and Equity Equivalents:** We estimate the values of long-term debt, unfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other non-equity claims using market or book values where appropriate. The total debt and equity equivalents are calculated at approximately $54.5 billion.  

7. **Value of Equity:** Subtracting debt and equity equivalents from enterprise value (operating asset value + nonoperating asset value) gives us an equity value of $83 billion. 

**Conclusion:**

Based on our DCF analysis with a conservative set of assumptions, we arrive at a valuation of approximately $97 billion for RTX, which is derived from adding the value of operations of $132 billion and non-operating assets of $5.5 billion and subtracting $54.5 billion in debt. This yields a value per share that is below the current market price as of valuation, suggesting the stock is modestly overvalued. This is not a surprise given my (our) generally pessimistic disposition. Given RTX's diverse businesses and the uncertainties surrounding certain segments like defense, this DCF-based valuation, which incorporates numerous financial data points over time and requires significant judgment, is highly likely to be wrong. However, performing this thorough DCF analysis has revealed where differences between my value and the market price are greatest: growth and margins in Collins Aerospace. This should be my focus.


**Important Caveats:**

* The DCF model is highly sensitive to assumptions about future growth, margins, and cost of capital.  Small changes in these inputs can dramatically affect the valuation.
* The aerospace and defense industry is subject to significant government regulation and geopolitical risks, which are difficult to predict and incorporate into a DCF model.


Given these uncertainties, the estimated valuation should be interpreted as a rough approximation, not a precise estimate of intrinsic value.  Further, given the inherent volatility of any single estimate, it should be combined with other valuation metrics and analysis to arrive at a more comprehensive and informed investment decision.
