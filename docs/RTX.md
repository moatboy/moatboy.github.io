{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

RTX's moat rating of 2/5 reflects a narrow moat.

* **Switching Costs:**  Government agencies and other large customers face significant costs and disruptions when changing mission-critical systems. This "lock-in" effect provides RTX with pricing power and reduces customer churn (Q3 2020 Earnings Call).
* **Relationships with Governments:**  Long-standing relationships with governments, particularly the U.S. government, provide some protection against competitive pressure.  Government contracts often involve tailored specifications and extended timeframes, creating high barriers to entry for new competitors (Q3 2020 Earnings Call).  
* **Industry Cyclicality:** The defense industry is inherently cyclical, tied to government budgets and geopolitical events. This cyclicality weakens the moat since earnings and cash flows can fluctuate dramatically over time, pressuring profitability and increasing competition for remaining business (Morgan Stanley report *Industry Analysis*). 
* **Increasing Competition:** Despite its strong positioning, RTX faces increasing competition from domestic and international players, including smaller, more nimble companies, particularly in niche segments (Morgan Stanley report *Competition*).

**Management Analysis**

RTX's management receives a rating of 3/5, reflecting a mixed assessment.

* **History/Experience:** RTX has a strong history and deep bench of experienced managers with long-standing relationships with key clients.  This is a positive contributing to stable growth and margins. However, the company's track record in managing acquisitions and integrating the acquired businesses has been somewhat inconsistent (Morgan Stanley report *Firm Interaction*).
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is largely tied to short-term performance metrics like earnings per share, which can incentivize actions that boost short-term results at the expense of long-term value creation.  While share-based compensation exists, it is not excessive (2023 Proxy Statement). 
* **Capital Allocation:** RTX has engaged in substantial debt-funded acquisitions, raising concerns about financial leverage.  While some acquisitions have been successful, others have raised questions about value creation (Q2 2021 Earnings Call). For instance, the acquisition of Collins Aerospace in 2020 significantly increased debt.
* **Communication/Transparency:** RTX provides detailed information about its various business segments in its financial reports and earnings calls, which is appreciated by intrinsic investors.  However, communication regarding long-term strategy and value drivers could be more explicit (Morgan Stanley report *Investor Communications*). The Collins Aerospace annual report included goodwill impairment charges that would otherwise have been hidden from RTX’s annual financials.
* **Insider Ownership:** Insider ownership is relatively low, suggesting less direct alignment between management and shareholder interests, a negative consideration.


**Catalyst Analysis**

RTX's catalyst rating of 2/5 suggests limited near-term upside catalysts.

* **Commercial Aerospace Recovery:**  As air travel recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, RTX's commercial aerospace business segment is well-positioned for revenue and earnings growth.  However, the pace of recovery remains uncertain and dependent on macroeconomic factors and the trajectory of the pandemic (Q2 2023 Earnings Call).  
* **Defense Spending Increase:**  Increased geopolitical tensions have spurred a rise in defense spending globally, which could benefit RTX's defense business segment.  However, the extent to which this increased spending will translate into increased profits for RTX remains uncertain due to cyclicality and competition (2023 10K). For instance, RTX's $1 billion missile defense system contract from Poland.
* **Debt Reduction:** RTX has acknowledged the need to reduce its debt load following recent acquisitions. Success in achieving debt reduction targets could improve the company's credit rating, lower its cost of capital, and boost investor confidence.  (2023 10K, 2023 Proxy Statement).


**Valuation**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, using a 10-year explicit forecast period, with conservative assumptions about growth, margins, reinvestment rate, and cost of capital indicates a value of $110 Billion for RTX. 

**Methodology:**

1. **Reorganize Financial Statements:** Separate operating and nonoperating items in the balance sheet and income statement, as well as free cash flow.
2. **Historical Analysis:** Analyze historical performance across segments, including revenues, margins, return on invested capital (ROIC), and reinvestment rates, over the past five years.
3. **Forecasting:** Develop a five-year explicit forecast, considering economic trends (U.S. real GDP growth of 2%, Inflation of 2%, and a gradual return to normalized industry operating margins), company's competitive positioning, and management's stated goals.
4. **Cost of Capital:** Estimate the cost of capital using a CAPM-based approach with a target debt-to-capital ratio of 15% and tax rate of 26%, which seems a reasonable, though conservative, given the need to deleverage.  
5. **Terminal Value:** Use the key value driver formula to estimate the continuing value at year 10 based on a long-term growth rate of 2% and a reinvestment rate of 10%, consistent with expectations of an increasingly competitive environment and a stable, mature company.  

**Key Assumptions and Calculations:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Average organic revenue growth of approximately 3.5% for the next five years (2024-2028), declining to 2% in the terminal period. This growth rate represents modest revenue expansion for the firm’s products and services, given the uncertainty of the post-COVID recovery (Morgan Stanley report *Industry Analysis*) .
* **Operating Margin:** Average operating margin of 15%,  in line with historical performance.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Reinvestment rate of 25% for the explicit forecast period. This rate captures the substantial portion of operating income typically needed by aerospace and defense companies to reinvest in maintaining competitiveness through R&D, product development and capex.
* **Cost of Capital:** Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.6%. This is based upon a conservative estimate using an industry unlevered beta of 0.72, a risk-free rate of 3.8%, an equity market risk premium of 5.4%, a cost of debt of 4%, and a target debt to capital ratio of 15% (2023 10K). Note that we have not considered the impact of a potential default on operating margins for a more robust, though still pessimistic, valuation estimate.

{: .note }

This valuation does not include the impact of divestitures or acquisitions. It also assumes a relatively stable economic environment.  Sensitivity and scenario analysis are recommended to fully understand the range of potential outcomes. Given the company’s large acquisitions and divestitures, particularly the recent spin-offs of Otis Worldwide and Carrier Global, the investor should proceed with caution when assessing the impact of the spin-offs on future operations.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Supply Chain Disruptions:**  Like many other manufacturing companies, RTX has been affected by supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. These issues have impacted production costs and delivery schedules (Q2 2023 Earnings Call).
* **Pension Obligations:**  RTX has significant pension obligations, which can be affected by interest rate and market fluctuations.  This creates volatility in reported earnings (2023 10K).  
* **Geopolitical Risk:**  RTX's business is exposed to geopolitical risks, including global conflicts and changing government defense budgets, which adds additional risk (2023 10K). For instance, the Russia-Ukraine war could indirectly disrupt RTX's supply chain and therefore the cost of supplies.


**Potential Upside Catalysts:**

RTX's business has limited near-term catalysts.

* **Commercial aerospace recovery:** RTX anticipates recovery from COVID disruptions in 2022 to boost 2023 results and beyond. 
* **Expansion into new markets:** RTX has plans to continue to invest in expanding the Raytheon Intelligence & Space market into developing countries to meet their aviation needs. Specifically, military training aircraft and other government contracts are a new priority for them to expand their revenue growth (Q3 2022 RTX Earnings Call).  

**Conclusion**

RTX, while a prominent player in its industry with a narrow moat, faces challenges including cyclicality and competition.  Management's recent focus on acquisitions has increased financial risk, though the company remains profitable.  While the commercial aerospace recovery and potential for increased defense spending could drive growth in the future, uncertainty and competition moderate the long-term outlook. The current valuation, based on conservative DCF analysis, suggests that RTX is fairly valued.  Investors considering RTX should carefully weigh the company's strengths and weaknesses and be prepared for the volatility inherent in its industry.
