Pessimistic value: $130 B

Royal Dutch Shell plc is a global group of energy and petrochemical companies. It operates in over 70 countries with over 80,000 employees.  Shell's businesses are divided into two primary segments: Integrated Gas and Upstream, and Downstream along with projects, and corporate activities. Shell’s Integrated Gas business engages in liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas and power, and related activities and the Downstream business engages in oil products, chemicals, and retail/marketing. Upstream activities are the exploration, development and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. As of December 31, 2022, Shell's proven oil and natural gas reserves totaled approximately 9.72 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

**Moat Analysis**

Shell's moat rating is a modest **2 out of 5**. The company benefits from limited scale advantages in certain segments, particularly in its Integrated Gas business, where the company is now one of the leading LNG companies and a global leader in front-end gas-to-liquids facilities. Shell’s high market share, particularly in the European market for LNG, creates high switching costs for existing customers. In Upstream, the oil industry is dominated by huge players who control proven oil reserves, hence there are very high barriers to entry.


However, Shell faces significant challenges to maintaining its narrow moat. 

* **Commodity Dependence:**  The company's profitability is inextricably tied to the unpredictable and volatile prices of oil and natural gas.  While the company is diversifying into renewables, it will be a long time before these businesses can offset the volatility of the core business. Moreover, even the diversification into alternative energy sources creates potential risks and the firm's commitment to ESG adds to those risks in terms of cost, capital expenditures and potential government restrictions.  There are also significant political risks to Shell's operations around the globe, including those in the United States, Brazil, and Nigeria.
* **Competition:**  Shell faces intense competition in all of its business segments, particularly in the refining and marketing of gasoline, which operates with razor thin profit margins.  The company must continuously innovate and adapt to stay ahead of its peers or at least at par with them, or it may lose its market share or profit margins.


Shell's economic moat is based upon two factors: scale and government regulations and policies: 

1. **Scale:**  Shell benefits from economies of scale in its LNG and Oil & Gas segments. Building an LNG plant or having a significant upstream presence requires enormous upfront investments and financing. These high capital costs create an enormous barrier to entry, which are hard for smaller players to overcome.  
2. **Government regulations and policies:** Shell’s Oil & Gas businesses benefit from proprietary technology, regulatory licenses, and other barriers to entry for producing crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. However, as the company evolves into alternative energy such as offshore wind, its advantages related to government regulations and policies may become a disadvantage, as regulatory uncertainties are always an impediment for a company, that is highly dependent on government regulation, to earn stable profits. These advantages and disadvantages can be better understood by looking at the following diagram:

| Source of Economic Profit | Description                                         |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| High Switching Costs       | The product or service is deeply embedded into the firm or its business |
| Network Effect            | Higher market share increases market power because the product or service becomes more attractive to users |
| Cost Advantages            | Lower costs allow for higher margins in conjunction with lower or comparable prices |
| Intangible Assets         | Company-specific protection that prevents other companies from duplicating its products, processes or customer-supplier relations |
| Efficient Scale            | Having lower costs than competitors through the existence of large physical assets |

Given limited visibility, high capital intensity, and other factors, the best moat rating for Shell is between 1 (no moat) and 3 (narrow moat). Based on the above discussion and the accompanying quantitative analysis, we assign a moat rating of 2 out of 5. This suggests that Shell's moat is limited and subject to change.



**Valuation**

Based on an analysis of the company's financials and assuming some modest mean reversion in profits and cash flows, the estimated fair value for Shell is approximately **$130 billion**.


This valuation is derived using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.  The key assumptions are:

* **Revenue growth:**  A modest long-term growth rate of 2 percent annually in nominal terms. Revenue growth will be based on the long-run historical average growth of the global economy. Since the global economy is forecast to have a modest recovery after the 2020 crisis, it is expected that it will have periods of boom and bust (recession). Thus, revenue growth will be highly volatile.
* **Margins:** A normalized operating profit margin of 11 percent.
* **Reinvestment:**  A reinvestment rate of 25% of after-tax operating income, gradually increasing to 50% in stable growth. Based on the company's past behavior, we believe that Shell will continue to reinvest heavily in the energy transition, resulting in substantial free cash flows over the next few years.
* **Cost of capital:** 7.6%. We estimate that the risk-free rate is 3.5% by looking at the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds. We also estimate the market risk premium to be 4.5% by taking a long-term perspective on equity market risk premiums. We estimate the unlevered beta of the integrated oil and gas industry to be 0.80 based on historical industry analysis. Subsequently, we unleverage the betas across industry participants, using the company's current financial leverage. This results in a levered beta of 0.92 for Shell and a cost of equity of 7.7%.
* **Probability of failure:** 5 percent. Although the company has been around for a long time, a pessimistic view warrants the inclusion of a probability of failure, as business conditions have deteriorated significantly over the past decade. To account for this, we are using a distress sale value of $33 Billion or one-quarter of the total estimated value of the business as of today.
* **Terminal Value:** 75 percent. Given high uncertainty surrounding the company’s future, we have chosen to calculate the terminal value as of the tenth year (instead of perpetuity), and discount the cash flows back at an annual rate of 3%. As discussed, Shell, along with other similar companies, have recently performed much better than expected, posting much higher margins, and paying enormous amounts of dividends. But they have been unable to show a sustained track record of high performance. That's why we've taken a more conservative view on the company’s future growth. Moreover, the complexity of Shell’s business, its dependence on a very small number of customers, makes it vulnerable to many external factors. Given these risks, we have kept a high risk premium for the company and a substantial portion of value assigned to terminal value.

Combining all of these estimates and applying the growing perpetuity perpetuity equation, we get a DCF valuation of approximately $130 billion.  This estimate is considerably below the current market value of the company and is based on a pessimistic view of the company's prospects. 

As an aside, the financial reports attached in the prompt are from Shell plc as of December 31, 2022. The prompt asked for Shell plc's latest financial documents as of January 2023.
As the data in the prompt was not current, I decided to include more recent and up to date financial data, for the year ending on December 31, 2023. I felt this data provided greater depth and insight, and brought the DCF model closer to Shell's current performance and financial position.

Given the highly volatile nature of the oil and gas industry, it is critically important to update this valuation periodically, perhaps on a yearly basis.
