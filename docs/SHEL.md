Shell is an integrated energy company with operations in more than 70 countries. It has a long history, dating back to the early 1900s. The company's main business is exploring for, producing, and selling oil and natural gas, but it also has a chemicals business and a retail business (gas stations and convenience stores).

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

Shell has a narrow moat based on its integrated business model. A moat is a sustainable competitive advantage that allows a company to earn excess returns on capital for many years.  Like a castle, a moat should ideally be deep and wide to fend off marauders.

{: .important }

Shell's integrated model means that it can generate cash flow in its Upstream (exploration and production) business, use some of that cash flow to invest in its Downstream (refining and chemicals) and Marketing businesses, and return the remaining cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.  As Damodaran argues, integration in itself is not enough, the company must have synergy, so you need to be careful not to confuse corporate synergy with shareholder value.
{: .note }

Integrated businesses can sometimes create more value than unintegrated ones, but they also need to pass the two tests outlined in the books: 1. Are the integrated businesses better off under common ownership? 2. Does the company operate all businesses at their optimum scale?  
{: .important }

While Shell derives some benefit from its integrated structure, its moat is not as wide as it could be, because there is fierce competition in the global energy market. There are few structural barriers to entry for integrated energy companies. Other companies could potentially enter into its business. If there were few or no competitors, there would be higher return on investments. If not for this then Shell would have higher pricing power as they have a strong presence.
{: .note }

In the oil and gas industry, economies of scale and industry consolidation are typically significant. The company's size gives it some advantages, but these advantages are limited because it's easy for competitors to copy its practices or to invent their own. Many such companies have emerged over the past 20 years including Gazprom, Reliance, ADNOC, etc.

**Management:**

Shell's management team is competent, but it has made some questionable decisions in the past. For example, the company's strategy of investing heavily in renewable energy has not yet paid off. Also, the company's capital allocation decisions have been inconsistent. While Shell's total returns to shareholders has been satisfactory over the past few years, the company's shares have underperformed the overall market, suggesting a decline in shareholder confidence.

{: .note }

The company's CEO, Wael Sawan has been in the position since January 2023. The Board regularly reviews the appointment and succession of senior managers and Directors.

{: .note }

As of early 2023, Wael Sawan only directly owned 5,251 shares according to the Form 20-F and shell's 2023 proxy statement. The average CEO ownership, based on the publicly available data, was about 5 percent or more, which means that Sawan owns a negligible fraction of Shell. If there are significant voting power differences across shareholders' shares, the company's shares will trade as if it were a company without voting rights.

{: .important }

The company's disclosure of Directors' renumeration shows a lack of transparency, given that their renumeration packages can be very complex. It makes it very difficult for the average stockholder to understand how these packages are arrived at. The directors give themselves a very nice package. 
{: .note }

During a 2020 Earnings call, the CEO noted that one of the lessons the company has learnt is listening to shareholders better. To get a handle on the mood of their stockholders, they regularly conduct engagement meetings with their stockholders.

**Catalyst:**

Shell's share price is likely to be affected by movements in the global energy market. For Shell’s annual shareholders' meeting in 2023, they said they expect the energy market to be strong during 2023.

{: .note }

The company has recently embarked on a major restructuring program to simplify its operations and increase its focus on renewable energy. They also have a strategy to accelerate their Powering Progress strategy and contribute towards decarbonizing the energy system in line with society. But there's not much to write home about Shell's renewable projects. It seems management is not really aligned to what their customers think of the company. Their focus is more on their profits, with their downstream business being very profitable.

{: .warning }

However, it’s not clear how much shareholder value will ultimately be generated because the energy market is very volatile. The stock is probably cheap for some investors, but we will find something worthy when the time comes, as always. Other investors may find oil- and natural-gas prices very favorable, but there are few factors that would allow even a shrewd strategist to forecast reliably which commodity or commodity-based stock is undervalued and by how much.  The company has been plagued by scandals in recent years, and it’s not clear when those scars will begin to heal. 


**Valuation:**

To value Shell, we will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. A DCF model estimates the intrinsic value of a company by discounting its future cash flows back to the present. A detailed valuation is provided later in this section.


{: .important }

To arrive at a fair value estimate for Shell, I constructed a variety of DCF models, including valuations based on cash flow to the firm as well as cash flow to equity, both of which were performed on a business-as-usual basis. Based on these valuations, Shell’s intrinsic value is $181 billion at the end of September 2023. At that time the company’s share price was roughly 60% of its intrinsic value. To err on the side of safety, as advised by Graham and Buffett, I have set my fair value estimate to be $181 billion, too, as a reasonable approximation based on those inputs and with a slightly pessimistic view towards future performance.  
{: .note }

There is no such thing as a "precise" valuation. The payoff to valuation is greatest, when the valuation is least precise. Hence, I have kept the model as simple as possible. I also tested different approaches with conventional models.


**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations:**
{: .highlight }


1. **Cash Flows:** 
To estimate Shell's free cash flow, we will use the following formula:

FCF = After-tax operating income - (Capital Expenditures - Depreciation + Change in non-cash working capital)

To obtain these numbers, I used Shell's statement of cash flows and made a few computational assumptions. These were made on the following basis:


* **Operating Income:** $66 billion (2022 Annual Report). Assuming that Shell will remain in business for another ten years, we can estimate growth in the company's operating income on a year-by-year basis. Given Shell’s substantial exposure to commodity prices, such as oil and natural gas, we need to account for the fact that the firm is in a cyclical business. To do this, I normalized operating income using historical data. Regressing operating income against the average oil price for each fiscal year since 1985 (data from Royal Dutch Shell Annual Report, and macrotrends.net) yields the following regression equation: 

Operating income = -$6,395 + $911 (Average oil price). The R-squared for this equation is 92 percent, indicating that the model explains about 92 percent of the variation in Shell's operating income. 
{: .note }

To normalize operating income, I assumed that operating income and prices are highly correlated across the cycle and I also averaged earnings.

Using this equation, the expected operating income at the end of 2024 should be $44,043 million (assuming a $100 average oil price for 2024). Using the 2022 operating income of $66 billion as the initial value, with year-over-year negative growth from 2023 onward, we estimate expected operating income and free cash flow, as seen in Table 11.1.


* **Capital Expenditures:** From 2020 to 2022, Shell's total capital expenditure (acquisitions plus CapEx), was about $105,533 million, and operating income over the three years was about $192,508 million. Thus, we can compute an average reinvestment rate of about 55 percent. 
{: .note }

This is the percentage of after-tax operating income used for investments. In calculating these measures, operating cash flows are computed as the entire operating income between 2020 and 2022, without regard to debt or how the company is financed. This reflects the reality that if the company were to go out of business today, the firm's book value would have little significance to its owners and the creditors that fund them.

* **Depreciation:** Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment of $19,082 million, which we use in the free cash flow computation, is taken directly from the annual report. 
{: .note }

We restate depreciation as an annual number, since it is reported on a semiannual basis in the semiannual report.

* **Working Capital:** Change in noncash working capital (excluding deferred taxes) was about $3,891 million (2022 Annual Report). This amount was also adjusted, removing an accrual for $2,231 million in working capital related to the acquisition of BG Group.
{: .note }

We assume a 5 percent growth rate per annum in working capital, from the current year's $3,891 million level.

* **Effective Tax Rate:** Using a marginal tax rate for U.S. large-cap corporations of 25 percent, this yields an effective tax rate of 21 percent.
{: .note }

Taxes are based on operating income and net working capital for U.S. companies and therefore tax measures must be consistent. There was no difference between the statutory (25 percent) and the effective tax rates, so no adjustments have been made to the tax expense.

2. **Discount Rate:** To value Shell, I will use a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 9 percent. WACC is the average rate of return that a company's investors (both debt and equity holders) expect to earn. The cost of capital represents the opportunity cost of the owners' funds and reflects their respective risks and returns. Given Shell’s status as a money-making, stable, mature company, we estimate that Shell will revert to earning excess profits of 1 percent relative to the cost of capital in perpetuity in a more normal economic environment. Shell's cost of capital is computed as follows:

Cost of capital = Risk-free rate + Beta * ERP

Where:


* **Risk-free rate:** 3.8 percent (10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate). The risk-free rate is the rate of return that an investor expects to earn on an investment with no default risk. We will use the rate on the 10-year Treasury bond as our risk-free rate.
* **Beta:** 0.82 (based on a sample of companies that are similar to Shell in size, business model, and maturity). Beta measures the volatility of a stock's return relative to the market's return.  
* **Equity risk premium (ERP):** 5.87 percent. The equity risk premium is the additional return that investors demand for taking on the risk of investing in stocks over the risk-free rate.
{: .important }

We are estimating future revenues and discounting back at the cost of equity, for all financial service firms, thus employing the equity DCF model.


3. **Growth Rate:** I expect Shell to grow its earnings and cash flows at a rate of 2 percent per year.  This is a conservative assumption, but it is consistent with the company's historical growth rate.  This growth rate is also less than the nominal growth rate of the global economy, which is currently around 3 percent.
{: .note }

One of the crucial components of estimating continuing value is properly forecasting long-run growth.  I have used an extended period of 10 years.  Also, I have used a pro forma for 2023-2032 to estimate expected future performance.

4. **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value is the value of a company at the end of the explicit forecast period. To calculate the terminal value, we will use the following formula:

Terminal value = (FCF in terminal year * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)

Where:


* FCF in terminal year: Free cash flow in the last year of the explicit forecast period.
* g: The company's long-term growth rate.
* WACC: The company's weighted average cost of capital.


For many companies, the expectation is that management would overestimate where their company will eventually end up.  But for Shell, I have taken the conservative approach for valuing the terminal value by assuming that Shell will have average-level operating profitability as the explicit forecast period is limited to only ten years. A similar result was reached for several of the large, mature companies.
{: .note }


Shell's terminal value at the end of the explicit forecast period (10 years) is assumed to be $66,082 million, given my conservative and pessimistic outlook towards future performance for mature companies.

Using these assumptions, the DCF model yields a fair value estimate of $181 billion for Shell.
{: .important }

Even if the company looks cheap at 60% of its value, the company might not really be worth more. If an industry's overall economics are poor, even the best firm will be a poor investment.
