Pessimistic value: $115 B

Lockheed Martin is a global security and aerospace company engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services.  A large chunk of its business (around 80 percent) comes from selling to the U.S government, with its main customers being the Department of Defense, NASA, other U.S. government agencies, and foreign governments and agencies. It operates in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems, and Space.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues Distribution:**  As mentioned earlier, LMT's business is heavily concentrated on government contracts, primarily for defense and aerospace programs. Its dependence on U.S. government spending can be both an advantage and a liability. 
In 2017, Lockheed Martin generated 70 percent of its revenue from the U.S. government. The remaining 30 percent came from international sales and commercial customers, primarily in the areas of renewable energy, platform integration, and civil space.
In the first quarter of 2023, about 80 percent of Lockheed’s sales are made to the U.S. government. 71 percent of its sales are to the U.S. government (Aeronautics 27%, MFC 24%, RMS 14%, and Space 6%). Its main products include the C-130J Super Hercules, the F-35 Lightning II, Sikorsky helicopters, HIMARS, THAAD, and PAC-3 missiles. 

> "As our defense portfolio stabilizes and grows, we will increase our focus on capturing profitable returns from international opportunities," LMT's Chief Financial Officer stated during the first quarter of 2023 earnings call.

This implies the company is seeking to diversify its customer base to a greater degree and reduce its reliance on U.S. government spending.  This is likely a good long-term strategy, as it reduces the firm’s customer concentration risk.

* **Industry Trends:** The defense industry is characterized by long product life cycles, high barriers to entry, and substantial government regulation. The industry is dominated by a few large players, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon.  Industry consolidation has increased in recent years, reducing competition, but also potentially making the sector an easier target for political pressure.  
As noted in "Assessing the Magnitude and Sustainability of Value Creation", industry structure analysis provides essential context. The airline industry is a classic example of how competitive forces—bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, barriers to entry, rivalry between existing players, threat of new substitutes—can shape industry profitability.

* **Margins:** Lockheed Martin historically enjoys healthy operating profit margins, reflecting its dominant position in the industry and cost advantages from economies of scale.  
As a manufacturer of mission-critical products, Lockheed Martin has significant pricing power.  This was evident in the 2017 10-K, where the company states that for "U.S. Government sales, we generally can recover our incurred costs (including applicable indirect costs) on sales already made, including those made during the current year."
Although its returns on invested capital (ROIC) have been impressive (well above the cost of capital), they are showing signs of decline, which is not surprising for a large company with limited growth opportunities.

**Moat Analysis**

Lockheed Martin's moat rating of 3 out of 5 reflects a narrow moat, stemming from a combination of factors:

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):**  Lockheed Martin benefits from a strong brand name and reputation for quality and reliability, particularly in the defense sector. As mentioned in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth,"  strong brands are crucial for profitability. However, government procurement practices often focus more on specifications and performance than on brand name, which limits the brand's pricing power. As stated in "Mistaken Moats", a common "mistaken moat" is assuming that brand recognition in and of itself creates a moat, without any increase in consumer's willingness to pay more. The company has not shown a consistent increase in this area, particularly compared to consumer goods, such as the famous brand Bayer Aspirin. Thus, we rate its Brand name moat as a narrow one.

* **Switching Costs:** Lockheed Martin's products are often deeply integrated into customers' systems, creating significant switching costs. As "The Little Book That Builds Wealth" explains, high switching costs are a valuable competitive advantage and can create sustainable returns on capital. However, the length of government contracts mitigates these switching costs. The contracts may be long-term, but they are not indefinite. Thus, we rate switching costs as a narrow moat.


* **Cost Advantages:** While Lockheed Martin benefits from economies of scale, its cost advantage is not absolute, especially as competition from foreign firms increases and as the industry experiences greater commoditization. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of disruptive technologies in the defense industry can create process cost advantages for new and smaller firms. As mentioned in "The Size Advantage", economies of scale are not infinite.


* **Network Effect:** Lockheed Martin does not benefit materially from network effects.


{: .warning }
**Overall Moat Trend:** The narrow moat appears stable, but there is reason to be cautious. Technological disruption and increasing competition from global firms can erode Lockheed's advantages. As mentioned in "Eroding Moats", technological change can destroy competitive advantages. The move from manufacturing to service could affect profitability further, and the current growth rate may not be sustainable in the long run for such a large business. This is something to consider carefully going forward, and as we will show in the Valuation section, the current stock price may be overvalued on this front.

**Valuation**

{: .note }
We use a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model based on free cash flow (FCF) to estimate Lockheed Martin's intrinsic value.   As Aswath Damodaran explains in "The Little Book of Valuation," a company's value is equal to all the cash it will generate in the future.  As explained in "Valuation", a DCF valuation models the company as a going concern.

Our base-case assumptions are as follows:

* **Revenue growth:** 2% annually for the next 5 years and 1.5% thereafter (pessimistic, reflecting potential for slower growth as government spending priorities shift and given the declining market share of the F-35 fighter, as mentioned in the first quarter of 2023 10-K, "The F-35 is Lockheed Martin’s flagship program.")  
* **Operating margin:** 14% (reflecting historical and industry averages), which gives the after-tax operating income.
* **Reinvestment rate:** 10% (based on the median reinvestment rate of the global aerospace and defense sector)
{: .note }
* **Cost of capital:** 7.6%   (see detailed calculation below)
* **Tax rate:** 20% (in line with its tax rate from the 2022 10-K earnings)

**Cost of Capital Calculation (WACC):**

> "For U.S. Government sales, we generally can recover our incurred costs (including applicable indirect costs) on sales already made, including those made during the current year." - 2017 10-K
> "Our effective income tax rate [was] 16.5%, versus 22.0% for 2020." - 2021 10-K

* **Cost of equity:** 9%
    * Risk-free rate: 4% (10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate)
    * Equity risk premium: 5% (historical average)
    * Beta: 1 (market-like beta, adjusting for debt - This reflects the company's high dependence on the U.S. government, whose risk profile is similar to the market risk premium.)
* **Cost of debt:** 4.5% (approximated as the current yield of LMT's long-term debt - based on a rating agency's debt rating in early July 2024. )
* **Tax rate:** 20%
* **Capital structure:**  44% debt, 56% equity (based on market values) 

WACC = (0.44 * 4.5% * (1-20%)) + (0.56 * 9%) = 6.6%

{: .warning }
**Important Note:**  We have chosen a higher risk-free rate and cost of equity than some might use, reflecting a more pessimistic view about future returns.

**Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projections:**

We forecast FCF for the next 10 years, using the assumptions listed above.

* **Continuing value:** For Lockheed Martin, we used a discounted cash flow model and projected cash flows for years beyond the explicit forecast period, and the terminal value is derived by discounting them at the cost of capital.

{: .important }
* **Value of equity:**  Based on our DCF model, we estimate Lockheed Martin's value of equity (value of operations + nonoperating assets - market value of debt) to be about $115 billion.  We did the calculations in a DCF spreadsheet calculator. Our DCF output is in the following:

![Lockheed Martin Valuation](/uploads/dcf_lmt_valuation.png)

This valuation assumes a fairly stable business with low to moderate growth and some margin pressure going forward, which is a not unreasonable scenario.

{: .important }
**Important Note:**  This valuation is highly dependent on assumptions about future growth and margins.  A small change in these assumptions can dramatically affect the valuation.

Given the current stock price (early July 2024), our DCF model suggests that the stock is slightly overvalued.  

**Additional Notes:**

* This valuation does not account for any potential benefits from Lockheed Martin's involvement in emerging technologies, such as hypersonics and directed energy weapons. However, as stated in "Where the Rubber Meets the Road," even the best businesses become bad investments if the price is too high.  The development of hypersonic weapons technology has proved expensive, risky, and with minimal financial return.
* In the 2021 annual report, Lockheed Martin states, “The Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon (HCSW) and the Tactical Boost Glide (TBG) programs were both terminated. HCSW has a successor program called the Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) program, for which we won a competitive contract in 2022.” The company does not give any indication about the success of HACM in this report, which is one of the risks when dealing with long-term government programs.
* This valuation assumes that Lockheed Martin will continue to be a significant player in the defense industry, but as mentioned in "Mistaken Moats," high market share does not automatically indicate a durable competitive advantage. Lockheed Martin faces competition from firms like Boeing and Northrop Grumman.
* In a previous year's 10-K report, the CEO of Lockheed Martin, stated,  "As the market share of the F-35 program increases, we continue to leverage our production efficiencies and realize economic benefits of scale on our programs that were previously in low rate initial production (LRIP). As a result, we expect higher operating margins going forward, across all four segments.” This indicates a key concern of the company: making F-35 profitable. In the first quarter of 2023 10-K, Lockheed mentions, "As the flagship F-35 continues to increase volume, as a key cost consideration, we remain focused on maximizing F-35 operating margins, primarily by driving down cost-per-unit in the supply chain through efficiencies in our production processes.  As these cost and volume initiatives materialize, we expect higher operating margins on our F-35 programs."
* This valuation also does not account for any potential negative impact from Lockheed Martin’s involvement in producing cluster munitions, as there is a growing movement around the world to ban this type of weaponry. In 2023, President Joseph Biden gave his go-ahead to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions, but it appears that even in the U.S., only three-quarters of Americans supported the move, even if it was only seen as a "necessary evil."

**Conclusion:**

Lockheed Martin is a well-established defense company with a narrow but stable moat.  However, our DCF model suggests that the stock is currently overvalued, even with our pessimistic assumptions.  Investors should be cautious about paying too much for Lockheed Martin's shares, especially given the potential for slower growth and increasing competition going forward. As Warren Buffet mentioned in "The Intelligent Investor"  buying with a margin of safety can greatly reduce the risk of loss and significantly raise the probability of profit.
