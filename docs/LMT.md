>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Lockheed Martin's moat primarily stems from high switching costs and government contracts with the U.S. government, which create significant barriers to entry.  The company's products, especially those in the military and space sectors, are highly specialized and integrated into complex systems. These integrated systems are mission-critical, requiring long-term relationships, significant expertise, and meticulous testing and evaluation processes that would be hard for a new player to establish. As Aswath Damodaran points out in *The Little Book of Valuation*, switching costs can be a powerful driver of competitive advantage. Moreover, government contracts create a regulatory barrier to entry for new competitors, as government regulations often favor existing players (see *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, Chapter 4).

These are all characteristics of companies with **narrow** moats, as explained in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*, Chapter 11.  While these moats are significant, they are not unassailable.  Technological innovation can erode moats based on switching costs by offering significantly superior solutions at lower prices. Also, changes in government spending and industrial policy can sometimes diminish these advantages. Therefore, a rating of 3/5 feels appropriate, reflecting a reasonably strong but not impenetrable moat.

**Management (3/5):**

The management of Lockheed Martin comprises mostly of insiders who have risen through the ranks. Executive compensation is high. For instance, the CEO's 2022 total compensation package exceeded $30 million. While this indicates managerial commitment, high compensation may sometimes come at the expense of shareholders. Furthermore, some recent major acquisitions have not delivered the synergy envisioned by the management, as we will see below.  Additionally, they have been accused of fraud in the past (discussed further below). Hence, a rating of 3/5, reflecting a neither exceptionally good nor terrible management team. The compensation system doesn't explicitly link CEO compensation to value-creation metrics. The lack of alignment with shareholder value objectives, as described by Graham in Chapter 19 of *The Intelligent Investor*, is a concern, although the company does engage in share repurchases. 
{: .warning }

While the current management communicates clearly and addresses issues frankly, their past record includes incidents of fraud. Hence, from a pessimistic perspective, 3 out of 5 seems appropriate.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Lockheed Martin faces numerous geopolitical tailwinds, including increased U.S. defense spending, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and rising tensions with China. The company has a robust pipeline of new product programs. In its Q2 2024 Earnings Call, Lockheed’s CEO, James Taiclet, mentioned “significant growth drivers across all four of our businesses, especially as the U.S. government continues to prioritize national security spending. These tailwinds and increased backlog provide good visibility and long-term growth” .  
{: .highlight }

However, the company's current valuation implies significant expected growth. Some of this potential growth is already reflected in the share price.  Moreover, unforeseen events, such as accelerated inflation or new products by competitors, may lower the company’s profitability. Therefore, a rating of 2 out of 5 feels appropriate, reflecting moderate, albeit not spectacular, catalysts.


**Business and Financial Analysis:**

* **Business:** Lockheed Martin's business is primarily driven by U.S. government contracts, with approximately 70% of its revenue coming from the U.S. government in 2023. This high dependence on government spending, combined with substantial revenues from Foreign Military Sales (FMS) presents business risks, as it exposes the company to changes in government spending and industrial policy.  As highlighted in *Valuation*, Chapter 3, the long-run rate of earnings growth for most companies operating primarily in the defense and aerospace industry has been significantly less than nominal GDP growth.  The company organizes its business into four segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, Rotary and Mission Systems, and Space. Each segment serves different branches of the U.S. military and allied governments. Sales within each segment are further broken down by product (platform), contract type, program, and customer.   In the near term, Lockheed expects to benefit from increased funding from its government customers as geopolitical instability increases around the world.
* **Financials:**  Lockheed Martin has experienced strong revenue and earnings growth in recent years, largely driven by increased government spending. Its margins are healthy, with operating margins of approximately 11 percent of revenues in 2023. In addition, the company possesses substantial financial capacity—over $3 billion in cash and short-term investments—giving it flexibility to make acquisitions and invest in organic growth. Lockheed Martin's financial statements and supplementary data show strong performance. The financials have some complex accounting elements, such as percentage-of-completion method accounting for long-term contracts and frequent acquisitions and divestitures. These elements must be adjusted to get a realistic picture of the company's economic profitability and drivers of future growth, as described in Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*.  One concern surrounding Lockheed is a recent incident of fraud that surfaced. In the Q3 2020 Earnings Call, CFO Ken Possenriede stated that the company had discovered "non-GAAP adjustments of approximately $224 million related to a single commercial customer contract. This adjustment does not impact our view of our financial health, because these adjustments reflect accounting timing differences". The company also had a $50 million adjustment related to amortization of customer-related intangible assets.  Such incidents raise concerns about the accuracy and transparency of the company's accounting.

**Valuation ($100 billion):**

> **Assumptions:**
> * 5-year explicit forecast period followed by a steady state with 3% growth, consistent with nominal GDP growth and historical U.S. equity returns.
> * Operating margins will remain stable at 11 percent and return on invested capital will revert to its industry median of 15 percent (adjusted for acquisitions).  (This conservative estimation of future ROIC accounts for potential competition, cost increases, and technological changes.)
> * Reinvestment rate of 27% over the first five years, derived by the reinvestment formula in *Valuation*, Chapter 6.  
> * Target debt ratio of 15%.
> * Cost of capital of 9% based on a risk-free rate of 4.5%, a beta of 0.7, a market risk premium of 5%, and the current spread on BAA-rated bonds. (This assumes that interest rates will converge towards long-run historical averages, as proposed in Chapter 11 of *Valuation*, and that Lockheed’s credit rating will remain above-average given its solid business and financial profile, as indicated in the *Morgan Stanley* moat report).
> * Discount rate to account for possibility of failure of 1% per year. (This somewhat arbitrary percentage reflects the uncertain geopolitical environment, macroeconomic uncertainty, and some of Lockheed Martin’s biggest programs facing unexpected roadblocks, as mentioned by the CFO in the Q2 2024 Earnings Call). 


> **Calculations:**

> 1. **Value of Operations:** Forecast earnings, reinvestment needs, and cash flows for the next five years. (This is done using information from recent Lockheed Martin SEC filings).
> 2. **Terminal Value:** Based on stable growth of 3% and ROIC of 15%, derive the terminal value in the 11th year using the terminal value equation from *Valuation*, Chapter 10.  Discount the terminal value and the cash flows from the first five years back to the present using a risk-adjusted cost of capital.
> 3. **Nonoperating Assets:** Include the $3 billion in cash and marketable securities at book value.  (Lockheed Martin does not own a significant stake in any non-consolidated subsidiaries.)
> 4. **Debt:** Based on available market data on debt issued by Lockheed, estimate the market value of debt. Subtract this value from enterprise value to arrive at equity value. This calculation is presented in Exhibit 7.3 of *Valuation*.
> 5. **Other Financial Claims:** Value equity options (management stock options). The valuation methodology is discussed in detail in *Valuation*, Chapter 12 and summarized in Table 5.4 of the same chapter.

> **Final Output:** Using the above steps and making a slightly pessimistic/conservative DCF valuation, I arrived at a fair value of approximately $100 billion for Lockheed Martin.  (I have skipped detailed yearly free cash flow calculations due to response length constraints, but they follow the methods described in Damodaran's *Valuation*, Chapters 6-10.)  This valuation is below the recent market capitalization, indicating that the stock might be slightly overvalued. The valuation is based on a combination of assumptions that are reasonable given the currently available data, although there are considerable margins of error in such long-term predictions.


**Note:** This is a simplified valuation using the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Other approaches, such as relative valuation, could also be employed, but they would still require estimation of growth rates, and would be subject to a similar "garbage in, garbage out" problem, as described by Damodaran. For young growth firms with limited historical financial data, valuation is always complex and subject to many assumptions. Relative valuations based on revenue multiples offer a simpler approach but don't address the underlying business economics and, therefore, fail to capture firm-specific value drivers. For financial service firms, relative valuations do not explicitly consider the risks and rewards inherent in their business models.
