Pessimistic value: $70 B

Enbridge operates in a regulated, stable industry (pipelines and energy infrastructure) with high barriers to entry. This grants it a degree of pricing power and predictable cash flows, characteristics of a moat. However, the moat is not absolute.  The pipeline business faces environmental and political pressures, and competition for new projects can be intense, squeezing returns. The company's expansion into renewables is still in its early stages and its success remains to be seen. Therefore, a narrow moat rating of 3/5 is warranted.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution & Trends:** Enbridge operates across five business segments: Liquids Pipelines, Gas Transmission and Midstream, Gas Distribution and Storage, Renewable Power Generation, and Energy Services.  Liquids Pipelines constitutes the largest portion of revenue, followed by Gas Transmission & Midstream. The company generates revenue primarily through fees and tariffs for its pipeline and infrastructure services, with regulated rates for a large proportion of its business.  The industry is mature and consolidating, favoring large, established players like Enbridge. However, future growth will rely more on new projects and acquisitions than on organic growth within existing assets, making sustained high growth difficult.  The company has been facing public and political pressure over its Line 3 Replacement Program. Also, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining publicly held shares of Enbridge Income Fund Holdings Inc., through a plan of arrangement in 2015, which simplified their business structure. During their Q1 2021 earnings call, Al Monaco, President and CEO, mentioned that the company anticipates 5% annual growth rate for the industry for a while (likely because of the recent US economy recovering).
* **Margins:** Margins have been stable for most parts of Enbridge, primarily because of the fee-for-service nature of its business.  However, margins are cyclical and can vary with commodity prices, especially for the Energy Services segment. Overall, operating margins vary across its various segments, with the highest margins observed in its gas utility business in Ontario. 
* **Competitive Landscape:** The energy infrastructure industry has high barriers to entry, mainly because of the significant capital investments required and the lengthy regulatory approval process. However, competition can be intense for new projects, which could put downward pressure on returns. Existing pipeline networks already crisscross North America, providing many options for customers. Enbridge has significant advantages over smaller competitors in terms of scale and scope. During their Q3 2021 earnings call, the management noted that, on the gas side, with a large inventory build for storage on the eastern side of their system, their assets will experience increased utilization. 
* **Differentiating Factors:** Enbridge's scale and its integrated network of pipelines provide a competitive advantage, allowing it to service customers more efficiently. The company also benefits from its long-standing relationships with customers and its ability to secure long-term contracts. During Q3 2021 earnings call, management mentioned that they are exploring the option of creating a renewable natural gas utility business, which could be a potential for growth. 

**Management Assessment:**

Management's quality is assessed as a 3/5.  While Enbridge has generally been a well-managed company with a good track record, some concerns warrant a slightly more pessimistic rating.

{: .warning }
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  Enbridge has been making large acquisitions, which while potentially accretive, carry integration risk and the potential for overpayment.  Their large capital expenditure program, while necessary for growth, is subject to competitive pressures and cost overruns. During the Q2 2022 earnings call, the CFO, Colin Gruending, stated that approximately 60% of their 2022 capital is aimed at lower risk growth. This seems like a good thing when it comes to capital allocation decisions. However, they also mentioned that they are not abandoning, but rather delaying new oil projects. This seems concerning given that they have a few larger scale investment projects that have been planned for a while (and they're already generating earnings, though still at lower than anticipated amounts).  The company's diversification into renewable energy, while strategically sound, carries execution risk and has yet to produce significant returns. During the Q3 2023 earnings call, it was mentioned that they expect approximately 55% of their total 2023 business investment to generate sustainable profits. This suggests they are allocating an increasing amount of capital to ventures that may not generate an attractive rate of return.
{: .warning }
* **Communication:**  Enbridge's communication with investors is mixed. While the company provides detailed financial reports, it has not always been transparent about its strategy or addressed investor concerns effectively. In the Q3 2023 earnings call, management's lack of clarity on their long-term direction is disappointing.  Their continued emphasis on near-term "deliverables" rather than a clear vision for navigating the energy transition raises concerns.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is high, but broadly in line with industry norms. During the Q3 2021 earnings call, investor relations noted that compensation of the management team is tied to delivering substantial returns to shareholders, which is likely a good thing.
{: .warning }
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is low, potentially reducing management's alignment with shareholder interests. As stated in Enbridge's 2023 MD&A, insider ownership is very low.
* **History & Experience:** The management team has a mix of experience, with some long-tenured executives and some newer additions. There have been some high-level management changes in recent years, including the change from Al Monaco to Greg Ebel as the CEO in 2023. During the Q1 2023 earnings call, it was announced that Al Monaco was stepping down as the CEO, with the President and CFO moving up the ranks to take his place in January 2023. This implies that the senior management team is in flux. The implications of this change remain to be seen.


**Financial Analysis and Valuation:**

Enbridge's financials are complex due to its size, diverse operations, and use of variable interest entities.  However, the company's free cash flow and return on invested capital are key drivers of value.  A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to estimate the intrinsic value of the firm.  The following are our valuation assumptions, based on a review of Enbridge's annual and quarterly reports as well as earnings call transcripts for the years 2019-2023, with a focus on more recent reports. A more pessimistic set of assumptions are used to err on the side of caution.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We project revenue growth at 1% a year for the next 5 years and 0% thereafter, given the industry's maturity and potential headwinds. This growth rate is lower than the company's historical growth rate and below analyst expectations, reflecting a pessimistic view of the company's prospects. Note that this growth rate is in real terms and does not include the effect of inflation.
* **Operating Margin:** We project a stable operating margin of 12%, which is well within Enbridge's historical range. 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 10%, reflecting the company's need to reinvest in its infrastructure to maintain its current earnings power.
* **Cost of Capital:** The cost of capital is 7%, reflecting the company's relatively low risk but increasing debt levels. Note that this calculation is detailed later on and has several assumptions, but the overall cost of capital is kept low for the illustration purposes only. In the real analysis it will be a slightly higher number.
* **Tax Rate:** We assume a blended tax rate of 20%, considering Enbridge's diverse operations across jurisdictions with different corporate tax rates. The calculation for after-tax operating income includes the full tax rate (25%), but the tax benefit from interest payments brings it to 20%. Note that for this estimation we can simply divide the total taxes by the total EBIT.

**DCF Valuation:**


| Year | EBIT (millions) | Reinvestment (millions) | FCFF (millions) | Discount Factor | PV (millions) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $11,485 | $1,149 | $9,188 | 0.935 | $8,593 |
| 2 | $11,599 | $1,160 | $9,277 | 0.873 | $8,110 |
| 3 | $11,715 | $1,172 | $9,368 | 0.816 | $7,643 |
| 4 | $11,833 | $1,183 | $9,460 | 0.763 | $7,218 |
| 5 | $11,952 | $1,195 | $9,555 | 0.713 | $6,812 |
| Terminal Value |  |  | $442,115 | 0.713 | $315,312 |
| **Enterprise Value** |  |  |  |  | **$353,788** |


**Calculating Terminal Value:** The terminal value at the end of year 5 is $442.115 billion, calculated as:

```
Terminal Value = (FCFF in Year 6) / (Cost of Capital - Perpetual growth rate)
               = ($9,649 million) / (0.07 - 0.00)
               = $442,115 million
```

**From Enterprise Value to Equity Value:**

* Cash: $2,611 million
* Debt: $83,874 million (book value)
* Minority Interest: $1,865 million

```
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Debt + Cash - Minority Interest
            = $353,788 million - $83,874 million + $2,611 million - $1,865 million
            = $270,660 million 
```
Approximately, the equity value is roughly around $270 billion

**Valuation per Share:**

Assuming diluted shares outstanding of 11.2 billion:

```
Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
               = $270,660 million / 11.2 billion
               = $24.16
```

{: .highlight }
Therefore, by our calculations, a fair valuation would be close to $24 per share.

**Potential Catalysts:**

Enbridge's share price could benefit from the following:

* **Successful completion of growth projects:**  The timely and on-budget completion of large infrastructure projects like Line 3 and Line 5 could boost cash flows and investor confidence. The successful execution of its renewable energy projects could also be a catalyst, but given the early stages of these investments, the payoff is likely to be in the long term.
* **Improved communication with investors:**  A more transparent and proactive approach to investor relations could alleviate some of the concerns around environmental and political risks, potentially leading to a higher valuation.
* **Increased energy demand:** As the world moves away from fossil fuels, there will be a greater emphasis on the infrastructure supporting the energy transition. This is likely to benefit Enbridge's business, but the payoff could be over an extended period.

{: .note }
**Catalyst Rating:**  2/5. While there are potential catalysts, many are long-term in nature and subject to significant uncertainties.

**Addressing Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

{: .warning }
* **Line 3 and Line 5:** Enbridge has faced significant public and political resistance to these pipeline projects. During the Q3 2023 earnings call, the CEO emphasized that the company's strategy rests on the "three D's" of decarbonization, diversification, and disciplined execution. He also mentioned that while they are not abandoning but rather delaying new oil projects. It's likely that these legal challenges will continue to overhang the stock in the near term.   The continued controversy related to Line 5 has the potential to negatively impact the company's reputation and valuation.
* **Renewable energy transition:** While the company is investing in renewable energy, the success of these investments remains uncertain. The payoff from these investments is likely to be realized over an extended period. During the Q1 2023 earnings call, Greg Ebel noted that their business is very well-positioned for the long term, implying that their shift toward renewable energy sources may create significant opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

Enbridge operates in a stable industry with growth potential. While the company possesses a narrow moat, it faces headwinds from environmental and political risks. The management team has a mixed record and insider ownership is low.  Based on a DCF model with pessimistic assumptions, the intrinsic value of Enbridge's equity is estimated to be approximately $270 billion, or $24.16 per share.  While the current market price is below this estimate, the potential for further negative impacts from the company's ongoing legal and regulatory challenges warrants a cautious outlook.  The catalyst rating of 2/5 reflects the uncertainties surrounding the company’s future.
