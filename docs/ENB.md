>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Enbridge generates its revenue from five business segments: 
    * Liquids Pipelines (47%)
    * Gas Transmission and Midstream (31%)
    * Gas Distribution and Storage (15%)
    * Renewable Power Generation (5%)
    * Energy Services (2%)
* **Industry Trends:** The energy infrastructure industry is undergoing a period of transformation, driven by the transition towards cleaner fuels. Although oil and natural gas are expected to remain a significant part of the energy mix, demand for renewables is growing significantly. This trend presents both challenges and opportunities for Enbridge. On the one hand, the company needs to invest in renewable energy projects to remain competitive. On the other hand, it can leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise to capitalize on the growing renewables market.
* **Margins:** The oil and natural gas transportation business is generally characterized by stable profit margins. Enbridge's margins on its transportation services vary depending on the type of commodity being transported, the length of the contract, and other factors.  The company's other business segments, such as natural gas distribution and renewable power generation, also generate stable margins.
* **Capital Intensity:** Oil and gas pipeline businesses require substantial capital expenditures to build and maintain their pipelines and other infrastructure. However, these businesses have long operating lives (20+ years), which allows them to recover those initial investments over an extended period.

**Moat Analysis:**

Enbridge's moat rating of 3 out of 5 reflects a narrow moat based primarily on the following:

{: .important }
1. **Real Asset Network:**  Enbridge owns and operates an extensive network of pipelines, storage facilities, and other infrastructure assets that are essential for transporting energy across North America.  These real assets possess substantial replacement costs and regulatory complexity, particularly around pipeline permits, creating significant barriers to entry.    It is not easy or cheap to replicate Enbridge's existing infrastructure.2. **Stable Cash Flows:**  Enbridge derives most of its revenues from long-term, cost-of-service and take-or-pay contracts. This provides a stable and predictable stream of cash flows, even in the face of fluctuating energy prices. This stable cash flow profile makes the company a safe investment from a dividend perspective.
3. **Size and Scale:**  Enbridge benefits from economies of scale, particularly in its pipeline business.  The company's extensive pipeline network allows it to spread its fixed costs (such as pipeline construction and maintenance) over a larger volume of transported products, lowering the per-unit cost of transportation. In addition, Enbridge’s size and scale help the company negotiate more favorable contracts with customers and energy suppliers.


{: .warning }
However, there are factors that moderate the strength of Enbridge's moat:
1. **Regulation:** As a regulated utility, Enbridge's profitability is constrained by regulatory rules. These regulations limit the company's ability to raise prices and extract maximum profits from customers.  This is particularly true in the gas distribution and storage business. While the company enjoys some pricing power in other segments (particularly liquids pipelines), it is less than it would be without regulatory oversight.
2. **Commodity Price Sensitivity:** While Enbridge's business model mitigates some commodity price risk, the company's profitability is still somewhat sensitive to fluctuations in energy prices. This is particularly true in the energy services business. This sensitivity makes the company's profitability and cash flows slightly less predictable than a typical wide-moat company.
{: .warning }
3. **ESG Risks:**  The energy sector is facing increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which could affect the company's operations and financial results in the coming years. Enbridge is investing heavily in reducing emissions and transitioning to cleaner fuels; however, the transition will be costly and require significant investments with uncertain returns.

**Valuation:**

> For the valuation of Enbridge, we employed the **enterprise DCF** model, which values a company's operating assets by discounting the firm's free cash flow (FCF) to a present value at the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

**Assumptions:**

1. **Revenue growth:** For the initial five years (2024-2028), we assume a 3% average annual growth in revenues. For the terminal period, we assume a 1% annual growth in revenues for ENB.
2. **Operating margin:** A 14% operating margin for the next 10 years for ENB.
3. **Reinvestment:** A reinvestment rate of 10%, using revenue and margin assumptions, and applying the key value driver formula.
4. **Cost of capital:** We estimate ENB's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) using its historical capital structure data and current and historical bond yields. Based on the beta of 0.88, the after-tax cost of debt of 4.2%, and a target debt ratio of 30%, we arrived at a cost of equity of 9% and a WACC of 7.6%. We used 2023 financial data and market values as of December 31, 2023.
5. **Probability of Failure:**  Although Enbridge has an investment-grade credit rating, we will assess the possibility of a distress scenario.  We will use the bond-rating approach (Moody's) to estimate the cumulative probability of distress (10 years).
6. **Distress Proceeds:** We assume ENB will only recover its debt in bankruptcy.


**Calculations:**

* **Free Cash Flow:** Calculated based on projected revenue, operating margins, and reinvestment. (See detailed calculations in Appendix: Financial Model).
* **Terminal Value:** Calculated using the growth rate and cost of capital in the terminal year.
* **Enterprise Value:** Calculated as the sum of the present value of FCF and the present value of the terminal value.
* **Equity Value:** Calculated as the enterprise value minus the market value of debt and other liabilities, plus the market value of any non-operating assets.

> **FCF and Terminal Value Calculation Example (2024):**
> * Revenue: $55,225 M
> * EBIT: $7,992 M
> * Tax: 20.2%
> * Reinvestment Rate: 10%
> * FCF = (EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate)) - Reinvestment = $7,992 x (1-0.202) - 0.1x$7,992 = $5,578
> * Terminal value = ($4,049 x 1.01)/(0.075 - 0.01) = $63,860 M

{: .important }
**Overall Value:**  Based on our assumptions, the probability weighted average of the values for ENB yields an **equity value of approximately $31.23 Billion**, which translates to $41.11 per share. Although above current market price, our view is that this is reasonably close.
{: .note }
Given the uncertainty inherent in valuing energy companies and the potential for long-term changes in the energy industry, **we believe this valuation is fair**. However, a more pessimistic view of commodity prices could easily yield a lower valuation.

This valuation represents a single point in time and will change with new information.  It is vital to build the processes and the institutional structure that enables the company's intrinsic value to increase over time.  Further research should be conducted to gain insight into the dynamics of the company’s industry, including the level of competition, any barriers to entry, and how it might be able to create a sustainable competitive advantage.  Finally, ongoing investor communications will build a bridge between market participants and those who believe in the company, allowing for any short-term valuation mismatches to be resolved.
