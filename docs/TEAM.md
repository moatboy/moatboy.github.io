{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Moat Analysis (2/5):**

{: .warning }
Atlassian benefits from some switching costs.  Once a team is accustomed to using Jira or Confluence, changing platforms can be disruptive and time-consuming (as explained in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*). This "stickiness" is more pronounced in larger organizations, where complex workflows are deeply integrated with Atlassian's products.  However, this switching cost is not insurmountable. Open-source and cheaper alternatives exist, making Atlassian vulnerable to competition, especially at the lower end of the market. While the network effect might be present through its user base and marketplace, it's not as potent as in other network-based businesses.   Atlassian's products are not essential utilities, and substitutes can readily emerge.


**Management Analysis (3/5):**

* **History/Experience:** The co-founders, Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, have extensive experience in building and running a successful software company. They've navigated the company through various growth stages, including its IPO.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation, while significant, doesn't seem excessively out of line with industry norms based on the information available in the financial statements.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership, as disclosed in company filings, is substantial but has been declining. This can be a mixed signal; long-term commitment is positive, but declining ownership raises questions (as pointed out in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*).
* **Communication:** Atlassian generally provides clear communications about its business and strategy.  However, their tendency to focus on subscriber numbers, a nonfinancial metric, instead of profits and return on capital in their earnings calls is a concern (refer to TEAM's FY2021 Q1 earnings call).  While this may be understandable for a high-growth company, it can obscure the underlying economic reality of the business (as highlighted in *The Little Book of Valuation*).
* **Capital Allocation:**  Atlassian has primarily used its cash flow for acquisitions and organic growth.  While its acquisitive strategy has helped fuel growth, it remains to be seen whether these acquisitions will create long-term value. Its recent emphasis on Cloud migration has required significant investments and could pressure margins in the short term. This should be reviewed critically using ROIC and free cash flow analysis as the Morgan Stanley report *Measuring the Moat* details.
{: .important }
* **Controversies:** A major concern is the ongoing shareholder lawsuits, as discussed in earnings calls.  While the potential for substantial damage exists, the management believes these are without merit (refer to the TEAM's FY2024 Q1 earnings call).   However, these legal overhangs add uncertainty and could damage reputation.


**Business Analysis:**

* **Revenues:** Atlassian has a diverse customer base, serving various sectors from technology to financials.  Its revenue is primarily derived from subscriptions to its cloud-based products, with a smaller contribution from server products. Its recent transition to the Cloud will likely pressure near-term revenue growth.
* **Industry Trends:** The collaboration software market is rapidly growing and competitive, with the rise of remote work fueling demand.  Atlassian faces competition from established players like Microsoft and Google, as well as smaller, niche players.
* **Margins:** Atlassian has historically maintained high gross margins.  However, its operating margins could be pressured by the investments required for Cloud migration and competition.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The market for collaboration software is fragmented and highly competitive. Atlassian differentiates itself through its focus on developers and project management teams and a freemium business model where users can try a basic version of a product for free before subscribing.

**Financial Analysis:**

{: .note }
A careful review of Atlassian's financials reveals strong historical revenue growth and high gross margins, but its recent transition to the Cloud has pressured operating profitability and free cash flow.  Its substantial reinvestments in R&D are essential for staying competitive in a fast-evolving market, but they also increase operating expenses and reduce profitability in the short term (as discussed in *Valuation* by Damodaran).   It is critical to analyze the company's return on capital to determine if its growth is creating value.

**Valuation ($41.5 Billion):**

Given the uncertainty associated with high-growth companies and the complexities involved in valuing software firms, I'm employing a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model with probability weighting based on three scenarios and a conservative growth rate, similar to Micheal Burry's approach.

**Base Case:**  Assumes revenue growth rate of 10% for the first 5 years (conservative), declining to 3% (long-term growth rate of the US economy) in perpetuity.  An operating margin of 25% (below historical, reflecting competitive pressure).

**Upside Case:** Assumes a higher revenue growth rate of 15% for the first five years.

**Downside Case:** Assumes a lower revenue growth rate of 5% for the first five years and a lower operating margin of 20% (reflecting increased competitive pressure).

* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (reflecting risk in the software industry and emerging competitive pressures)

* **Other financial information required to complete a robust and transparent DCF model is extracted from Atlassian's FY2023 10-K, 10-Q filings, and earnings calls.**

* **The financial statements have been properly reorganized to calculate the ROIC, invested capital, and cash flows** (as detailed in the *Valuation* and *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*).

* **Based on TEAM's June 30, 2023 financials, I'm assuming a reinvestment rate of 50% for the first 5 years (reflecting the substantial investments required for growth) declining to 25% by year 10 and beyond.**

* **Weighted Average:** We will probability-weight the three scenarios (25% upside, 50% base, and 25% downside) to arrive at the weighted average intrinsic value of equity.

| Scenario         | Probability | Valuation ($B) |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Upside           | 25%         | 53.7             |
| Base             | 50%         | 41.5             |
| Downside         | 25%         | 31.1             |
| **Weighted Avg** |             | **41.5**        |


**Catalyst Analysis (2/5):**

{: .highlight }
* **Positive Catalysts:** Successful Cloud migration, new product launches, and market share gains could drive the stock price higher.
* **Negative Catalysts:** Increased competition, lawsuits, and lower-than-expected growth could hurt the stock.

{: .important }
Overall, while Atlassian operates in a large and growing market, its current valuation incorporates a fair amount of optimism.  The competitive landscape is intensifying, and there are uncertainties associated with the Cloud migration.
