Newmont Corporation is a gold mining company with operations primarily in North America, South America, Australia, and Africa. While it holds the title of the world's largest gold producer, a closer look reveals a business whose competitive advantages are not as glittering as they might first appear.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

Newmont's moat stems primarily from its size and the inherent difficulty of finding and extracting gold.  Larger firms like Newmont can benefit from economies of scale in some areas, such as negotiating supply contracts and spreading exploration costs. However, these advantages are limited. Gold is a commodity, and the company's pricing power is dictated by global supply and demand.  

* **Limited Pricing Power:** As highlighted in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, commodity businesses struggle to maintain pricing power, making cost advantages critical.  While Newmont benefits from scale, its ultimate profitability remains tied to the fluctuating price of gold.  This diminishes the strength of any cost advantage relative to peers.
* **Challenging Industry Dynamics:**  The mining industry faces significant environmental and regulatory hurdles, adding to costs and uncertainty.  As explored in *Valuation*, the long-term value of commodity companies is difficult to predict, given their dependence on fluctuating commodity prices and the cyclicality of the industry. These factors create risk and reduce the predictability of future cash flows, limiting the durability of the moat.
* **Management Discussion of the 2019 Annual Report:** NEM's annual report acknowledges the significant impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and market conditions on financial metrics, further emphasizing the unpredictable and cyclical nature of the industry. This reinforces the idea that any competitive advantages are susceptible to external factors and management decisions, making it hard to assign a wide moat rating.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

Newmont's management team displays a mixed track record, leading to a middling rating. 

{: .warning }
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  Like many mature companies, Newmont has turned to acquisitions for growth. As discussed in *Valuation*, acquisitions can often destroy value, particularly when acquirers overpay. Newmont's recent acquisition of Newcrest Mining (discussed in the Q3 2023 earnings call) is a bet on increased scale and synergies, but the ultimate success of this integration remains uncertain.  This demonstrates a potential weakness in capital allocation.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation, while substantial, does not appear excessively out of line with industry peers, suggesting reasonable alignment with shareholder interests.  
* **Communication:** Management's communications appear adequate, with reasonable transparency in financial reporting and candid discussions of the challenges facing the business in earnings calls. For example, in the Q3 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged the short-term headwinds related to lower gold prices and its impact on profitability.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Levels of insider ownership are not exceptionally high, which could be viewed negatively from an alignment perspective. However, this is not unusual for a large-cap company.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

* **Gold Price Rebound:** A rebound in gold prices would be a significant catalyst for Newmont. Management, in recent earnings calls, expressed optimism about a recovery in the gold market, pointing to macroeconomic uncertainty and central bank purchases as drivers.  However, accurately predicting the timing and extent of such a rebound is challenging. The uncertainty surrounding the direction of gold prices limits the catalyst rating.
* **Successful Newcrest Integration:**  Successful integration of Newcrest, leading to cost savings and increased production, could act as a moderate catalyst.  However, integration efforts are still in their early stages, and there is considerable execution risk.


**Valuation ($31.4 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using free cash flow to the firm (FCFF), provides the most reasonable estimate of Newmont's intrinsic value. I took inspiration from Michael Burry's valuation approaches documented in *The Big Short*, focusing on the fundamentals and maintaining a skeptical outlook. I used a five-year explicit forecast period and made conservative assumptions about future cash flows and cost of capital. 


**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Moderate revenue growth is assumed for the next five years, gradually declining towards 2 percent in perpetuity. This conservative assumption reflects the mature nature of the gold market and the challenge of sustaining high growth in commodity businesses, a point emphasized in *Valuation*. 
{: .important }
* **Operating Margin:**  Modest margin improvement is forecast over the next five years, assuming continued cost efficiencies from the Newcrest acquisition.
* **Cost of Capital:**  A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7.5 percent is used. This reflects a moderately higher equity risk premium to account for the riskiness of the mining sector. The market risk premium is estimated at 5.5%, which is on the higher end of the historical range, as suggested in *Valuation*. Given that I'm adopting a conservative approach and the uncertainty in the sector, this seems appropriate.
* **Terminal Value:**  The continuing value, representing the value of the business beyond the explicit forecast period, is estimated using the perpetuity growth method with a 2 percent growth rate, reflecting long-term economic growth, and a terminal WACC of 7%.
* **No significant financial or management changes.**

**DCF Calculation:**

| Year | Free Cash Flow to Firm ($B) | Cumulative Discount Factor | Present Value of FCFF ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $2.1 | 1/1.075 = 0.930 | $1.95 |
| 2 | $2.2 | 0.930/1.075 = 0.865 | $1.90 |
| 3 | $2.3 | 0.865/1.075 = 0.805 | $1.85 |
| 4 | $2.4 | 0.805/1.075 = 0.748 | $1.79 |
| 5 | $2.5 | 0.748/1.075 = 0.697 | $1.74 |
| Terminal Value (Year 6-Perpetuity) | | | $25.63 |

* **Present Value of Operations** (sum of present values): $30.86 Billion
* **Cash** (from balance sheet): $0.2 Billion
* **Debt:** (from balance sheet): $6 Billion
* **Minority Interests** (estimated at 10% of equity): $0.72 Billion
{: .note }
* **Value of Equity:** $30.86 + $0.2 - $6 - $0.72 = $24.34 Billion
* **Shares Outstanding:** 1.22 Billion
* **Fair Value per Share:** $24.34 / 1.22 = $20
* **Current Market Capitalization** = $44 Billion
* **Premium to My estimated Fair Value:** ($44 - $24.34)/$24.34 = 80%


**Conclusion:**

Newmont's position as the largest gold producer gives it some scale advantages, but the volatile nature of the gold market and the risks inherent in the mining business limit its moat.  The company's valuation, based on our DCF model, appears significantly overvalued at the current price, driven in part by a higher-than-justified market risk premium. While a rebound in gold prices and successful integration of Newcrest could drive the stock higher, these factors are uncertain and make timing an investment challenging.  A conservative investor might want to look for opportunities where the "margin of safety," as emphasized by Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*, is considerably wider.
