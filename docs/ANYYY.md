{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5): Narrow**

1010data's moat stems primarily from its **data assets and switching costs**. The company has accumulated a substantial amount of data over time, providing a rich historical record for analysis. As Damodaran mentions in *The Little Book of Valuation*, "Assets with high and stable cash flows should be worth more than assets with low and volatile cash flows.”  While the data itself is valuable, the challenge lies in maintaining its exclusivity and preventing competitors from accumulating similar datasets. The network effect is limited as the value derived from the data is not significantly enhanced by more users joining the platform, unlike social networks, as discussed in Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*.

Switching costs exist as clients integrate 1010data's platform into their workflows. Migrating to a new provider would entail substantial costs and disruptions, as emphasized in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*: "Companies that make it tough for customers to switch costs…can extract more money out of its customers." However, these switching costs are not insurmountable, especially if a competitor offers a significantly superior product or price, limiting the moat's width.

**Management (3/5): Average**

The management team receives an average rating based on several factors:

* **Experience:** The management team has experience in the analytics industry, but their track record at 1010data itself has been mixed.  Profitability has been inconsistent, indicating potential challenges in execution.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:**  Investments in new products and services have not always translated into sustained growth and profits. As Burry frequently emphasizes, even "good" investments can go wrong if flawed assumptions are made.
* **Communication:**  Management communication has generally been candid about the company's challenges and opportunities.  However,  some earnings calls and press releases have overemphasized short-term wins, potentially distracting from a focus on long-term value creation, as pointed out in Damodaran's book.  
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation does not appear to be excessively high relative to company performance, aligning with shareholder interests.

**Catalyst (2/5): Moderate**

Potential catalysts for 1010data include:

* **New product development:** Expansion into new verticals or offerings could drive growth. However, previous efforts have not always been successful, making success uncertain.
* **Strategic partnerships or acquisitions:** A strategic alliance with a larger technology company or acquisition by a larger player could provide access to new customers and resources.
* **Improved market conditions:** A rebound in retail spending could drive higher demand for 1010data's services. However, given the macroeconomic outlook, a robust rebound is uncertain. 


**Valuation ($20.60/share):**

An intrinsic valuation was performed using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, as outlined in Damodaran's book and Koller et al.'s *Valuation*, focusing on free cash flow to equity (FCFE). The following assumptions were made:

**Inputs:**

* **Cash Flows:** FCFE was derived from the 2022 annual report and projected for the next five years. See Table 3.3 for the conversion from net income to potential dividends (or FCFE).
    * 2020: -$311 million
    * 2021: $8.16 million
    * 2022: $7.26 million
* **Growth:** Revenue growth was estimated based on recent trends and industry projections, assuming a slowdown in growth beyond the explicit forecast period due to market saturation. For a mature company like Kraft Heinz, this approach is consistent with Damodaran's recommendations in his book for estimating sustainable growth. See Table 3.7 for projected revenue operating to firm and Table 3.8 for estimating sustainable growth. 
* **Risk:** The cost of equity was estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to adjust for risk. Market risk was calculated using beta. A lower risk-free rate was used due to the prevailing low interest rates. The equity risk premium was estimated based on historical market returns. See Table 3.6 for the cost of capital inputs.
* **Terminal Value:** The terminal value was calculated using a perpetual growth rate consistent with estimates for GDP growth. The reinvestment rate in stable growth was assumed to be higher than the growth rate. See Table 3.9 for the terminal value inputs.


**Calculations:**
Following the steps for DCF valuation as described in Koller et al.'s *Valuation*, we discounted the projected free cash flows and terminal value back to present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. See Table 3.10 for the details of discounted cash flows and Table 3.11 for discount factor calculations (derived from Table 3.10 using 7.56% cost of capital).

* Terminal Value Discounting: (49.316 million)/(1.0756)^10 = 24.530 million


* Year 1: 7.560/((1+7.56%)^1) = 6.997
* Year 2: 7.560/((1+7.56%)^2) = 6.493
* Year 3: 7.560/((1+7.56%)^3) = 6.035
* Year 4: 7.560/((1+7.56%)^4) = 5.612
* Year 5: 7.560/((1+7.56%)^5) = 5.222


* Year 6: 8.108/((1+7.56%)^6) = 5.098
* Year 7: 8.772/((1+7.56%)^7) = 4.818
* Year 8: 9.108/((1+7.56%)^8) = 4.433
* Year 9: 9.122/((1+7.56%)^9) = 4.082
* Year 10: 9.199/((1+7.56%)^10) = 3.760


{: .note }

 For Year 7, since costs of capital are changing, we discount the cash flows in Year 7 by taking the present value in Year 7 of future cash flows. For example, for Year 7:
(1+g) / (r-g) = (1+0.04) / (0.12 - 0.04) = 13.75
Discounted cash flow in Year 7 = 13.75/(1.10)^(1) × (1.10)^1 = 13.75.
13.75/(1.0756)^7 = 8.772


**Outputs:**

* **Value of operating assets:** The sum of the present value of free cash flows and terminal value is $44.538 billion.
* **Value/share:**  The total value of operating assets is $44.538 billion. Adding nonoperating assets (cash balance) and subtracting outstanding debt,  and dividing by the number of shares outstanding, we estimate a value of $20.60 per share.



**Addressing Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

1010data has faced challenges in maintaining consistent growth and profitability amid increasing competition. During the 2023 Q2 earnings call, management acknowledged the tough macroeconomic environment and emphasized the need to focus on cost control and operational efficiency. Specifically, the COO stated, “Navigating the current economic landscape requires a laser-like focus on both efficiency and delivering strong ROI for our clients."  The company has also faced pressure from activist investors regarding its capital structure and allocation.

**Conclusion:**

1010data possesses a narrow moat, with its data assets and switching costs providing some protection from competition. Management's track record is mixed, and their ability to execute on growth plans remains to be seen. While some upside potential exists if management can deliver on its promises of improved profitability and growth, the current valuation appears to fully reflect those expectations.  A more pessimistic outlook would lower the estimated growth rate and operating margins, which could lead to a lower valuation.
