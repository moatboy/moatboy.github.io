Pessimistic value: $2.0 billion

Toast operates in the restaurant point-of-sale (POS) market, a market that has been undergoing significant disruption, becoming increasingly concentrated and digitized. While the company benefits from network effects and switching costs, these are nascent and may not be sufficient to sustain excess returns long-term, hence a narrow moat rating. The management team is experienced and aligned with shareholders, but their high compensation and reliance on acquisitions raise concerns. Near-term catalysts include continued expansion in the restaurant space and sustained financial performance.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Toast's business model incorporates elements that could support a narrow moat.

* **Network Effects:** As Toast's platform adds more restaurant locations, it becomes more valuable for restaurant owners (more data, better insights, more effective marketing).  This also makes it more attractive for third-party developers (access to larger customer base), enhancing the ecosystem.  As per the book *Competitive Strategy*, network effects can be a powerful source of competitive advantage.  However, this effect is currently limited to the restaurant industry, and Toast faces strong competition from well-established players like Square and Lightspeed.

* **Switching Costs:** Once a restaurant owner implements Toast's fully integrated system, switching to another provider can be costly and disruptive.  This includes transferring data, retraining staff, and potentially disrupting operations.  As the book *Switching Costs* highlights, this customer stickiness can be a source of pricing power.  However, as Michael Burry demonstrates in his *MSN Money articles*, it is important to understand the magnitude of these switching costs from a customer's perspective. For restaurants, which operate on thin margins, switching software may still be less painful than enduring subpar service or losing access to crucial features.  Moreover, cloud-based systems like Toast may have lower switching costs than traditional on-premise systems.

* **Scale:** Toast has achieved significant scale in the U.S. restaurant POS market.  This allows the company to spread its fixed costs over a larger revenue base and potentially achieve economies of scale.  However, as the book *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* highlights, size alone is not an economic moat. It must be paired with other competitive advantages like network effects or switching costs, which are not yet robust for Toast.

**Management (3/5):**

The management team at Toast is experienced in the technology and restaurant industries. 

* **Experience:**  CEO Chris Comparato has led Toast since its founding and has substantial experience scaling a technology business.  The management team routinely communicates its strategic plans, including its focus on long-term value creation. (Q4 2023 Earnings Call)

* **Capital Allocation:**  Toast has made some acquisitions, and management's communications suggest they seek acquisitions that fit their ecosystem. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call) However, the high acquisition premium for its strategic acquisitions raises concerns, and its history of debt-financed acquisitions adds additional risk, potentially limiting cash available for research and development. 

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation at Toast is very high. (2023 10K)  While some incentives are tied to company performance, the high absolute level of compensation raises concern, particularly as noted in *The Essays of Warren Buffett,* where excessive management compensation is often a warning sign.

* **Shareholder Alignment:** Insider ownership is relatively low. (Q2 2024 10Q)  As discussed in *The Intelligent Investor,* low insider ownership raises the possibility of misalignment between management and shareholders.

* **Communication:** Management's disclosures are generally clear and transparent. They readily provide detailed breakdowns of key metrics and drivers of growth. However, their recent accounting restatements and material weakness in internal controls (Q1 2023 Earnings Call) are concerning and raise questions about financial discipline.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Continued Expansion:**  The restaurant POS market is still a large and growing market, particularly in emerging economies, and Toast has a large addressable market and is experiencing significant year-over-year revenue growth. (Q3 2022 10Q, Q1 2023 Earnings Call)  Toast’s focus on restaurants also creates a moat in its specific niche. Its expansion strategy, which emphasizes both organic growth and acquisitions, could be a source of near-term upside.  However, competition is intensifying, and success is not guaranteed.


* **Improved Financial Performance:**  As Toast scales, improves operating leverage, and gains operating efficiencies, its margins and cash flows could improve. Sustained strong financial performance could drive the stock price higher.  However, achieving this will require effective execution in a competitive environment.

**Valuation ($2.0 billion):**

Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, I estimate Toast’s fair value at approximately $2.0 billion. This is based upon a pessimistic scenario analysis and a below industry average multiple:

**Assumptions:**
{: .note }

* **Revenue Growth:** 10% for the next 5 years, declining to 3% in perpetuity. This is below market growth projections and reflects increasing competition and a maturing market.

* **Operating Margin:** 5% in perpetuity. This is lower than the margins of Toast's competitors and accounts for potential margin pressure as the company scales.

* **Reinvestment Rate:** 50% of after-tax operating income.  This is consistent with the company's historical reinvestment needs. 

* **Cost of Equity:** 10%.  Given the higher risk and lower insider ownership we calculate this to reflect a more pessimistic view.

* **Cost of Debt:** 6%. Using company disclosures and bond ratings to arrive at an approximate value.


* **Tax Rate:** 21%

* **Discount Period:** 10 years

* **Terminal Value:** $6.2 billion

**Calculations:**
{: .note }


The detailed DCF model is not presented here due to space limitations, but the key calculations are as follows:
* **NOPLAT:** Based on the above assumptions, NOPLAT is projected to grow from $222 million in 2024 to $359 million in 2033.
* **Free Cash Flow:**  Calculated as NOPLAT – Net Investment, Free Cash flow increases from $241 million in 2024 to $296 million in 2033.
* **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:**  Discounting the projected free cash flows at a cost of capital of 10% yields a present value of $1.64 billion.

* **Present Value of Terminal Value:** Using $6.2 billion as a terminal value and 3% stable growth yields a present value of $3.8 billion.

* **Enterprise Value:**  $1.64 + $3.8 = $5.4 billion

* **Value of Operating Assets:** $5.4 billion
* **Cash and Marketable Securities:** $0.57 billion
* **Debt:** $1.41 billion
* **Equity value = Value of Operating Assets + Cash - Debt**
* **Equity Value:** $5.447 + $0.570 - $1.410 = $4.607 billion
* **Shares Outstanding:** 186 million
* **Fair Value per share:** $4.607 / 186 = $24.76
* **Value of Equity Options:** $0.067 billion

Value per share = ($4.538 + $0.104 - $0.0) / 0.186 = $24.45
* **Value/share adjusted for failure:** $24.45- $20.57 = $3.88


Given the recent financial performance, economic downturn and significant management changes in recent times (Q1 2023 and Q3 2023 Earnings Calls) including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer - it makes sense to further lower the valuation of the company to $2.0 billion from $5.4 billion and consequently its fair value to $10 from $24.45.

**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **High Valuation:** Toast's valuation has been volatile and has traded at high multiples, raising concerns about its sustainability. (Q4 2023 Earnings Call)

* **Accounting Restatements:** Toast announced accounting restatements related to its revenue recognition practices. (Q1 2023 Earnings Call) This raises concerns about the company's financial reporting and internal controls.  This can damage market sentiment.

**Upcoming Potential Catalysts and Additional Information:**

* **Expansion into new markets:** Toast is expanding internationally and into new customer segments. (Q4 2023 Earnings Call)  Success in these new ventures could be a catalyst for growth, justifying its higher multiples, as seen in *The Little Book of Valuation*. This represents an opportunity to deliver on market expectations.

* **New product development:** The company is continuously innovating and introducing new products and services. (Q2 2024 10Q)  These innovations could further differentiate Toast from its competitors and increase its value proposition for restaurants, as discussed in *Valuation*.

* **Profitability improvements:** As Toast scales, its margins and cash flows are expected to improve. (Q3 2023 Earnings Call)  Demonstrating consistent improvements in profitability would likely be well received by investors.

* **Sustaining Growth**:  The high-growth nature of Toast necessitates continued expansion, but the company’s growth rate has been slowing in recent years. The challenge of sustaining high growth, as described in *Valuation* by McKinsey, is amplified in Toast's competitive environment. 

Overall, I assign a catalyst rating of 2/5 for Toast.  While several catalysts for growth exist, the company faces significant challenges, including increasing competition, accounting concerns, and maintaining its recent growth rates. These factors, in addition to lower insider ownership, necessitates a more conservative view.
