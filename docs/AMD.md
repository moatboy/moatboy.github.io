Pessimistic value: $88.8 B

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a global semiconductor company that develops high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies for a variety of markets, including servers, PCs, embedded devices, and game consoles. The company operates in four segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded.  AMD has become a significant competitor to Intel in the server and PC markets and to Nvidia in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market.  The company's growth has been driven by its focus on high-performance products, its innovative design capabilities, and its strategic partnerships.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.

**Moat Analysis**

While AMD has made significant strides in recent years, a strict moat assessment reveals a narrow moat, assigned a rating of **2 out of 5**. The primary source of AMD's competitive advantage lies in its **innovation**. The company has demonstrated an ability to design and produce high-performance chips, particularly in the server and GPU markets, that compete effectively with industry leaders.  This has translated into substantial market share gains and improved profitability. However, the highly competitive and cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry significantly limits the durability of this advantage.

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** While AMD's brand recognition has increased, it still lags behind industry leaders Intel and Nvidia. Brand loyalty in the consumer semiconductor market is relatively weak, and consumers are generally more influenced by performance and price. Hence, the brand contributes minimally to AMD's moat.
* **Switching Costs:** Switching costs for customers are generally low in the consumer market.  While enterprise clients may incur some switching costs related to software and integration, these are not as high as in some other industries and are unlikely to provide long-term protection.
* **Network Effect:** Minimal network effects exist for AMD's products. While AMD does have some partnerships, these do not create the type of closed network that could prevent entry or induce substantial lock-in.
* **Cost Advantage:** AMD historically did *not* have a sustainable cost advantage over Intel. Although AMD has made improvements on cost and capital efficiency, they're not sufficiently unique to build a high barrier to entry.  Foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), on which AMD depends for its production, serve other chip designers as well and therefore offer no particular cost advantages to AMD. Furthermore, process-based cost advantages are generally short-lived in technology industries.
* **Government:** Regulatory advantages do not contribute to AMD's moat.  The semiconductor industry is not regulated like the utility sector, and therefore regulations cannot easily provide AMD with pricing power or a captive customer base.

**Moat Concerns**

* **Cyclicality:** The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical.  Demand for chips is tied to macroeconomic factors and end-market demand, making it challenging for AMD to maintain its profitability and revenue growth rates through economic cycles.
* **Competition:**  The semiconductor industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change, particularly given Intel's comeback. This puts substantial pressure on AMD to continuously innovate and control costs.  Any disruption in its design or production process could hurt its competitiveness. The success or failure of AMD's planned acquisition of Xilinx, now completed, could affect the company's long-term track record.
* **Capital Intensity:** Maintaining cutting-edge design and manufacturing capacity requires significant and sustained R&D investments, putting a strain on the firm's ability to consistently generate high returns on capital.

**Valuation**

A valuation of AMD, with a pessimistic outlook, yields a fair value of **\$88.8 billion**. This valuation uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on the company's financial statements from 2017 through 2022. The key assumptions are:

1. **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue growth is assumed to decelerate from 10% in 2024 to a stable rate of 3%. This is a pessimistic assumption given historical growth rates but reflects increased competition and the potential for market saturation.
2. **Operating Margin:**  The operating margin is assumed to be 20%. This is based on historical averages and peer comparisons but is adjusted downward to reflect increased competition.
3. **Reinvestment Rate:** The reinvestment rate is set at 30%, lower than in previous years but still reflecting significant capital expenditures for a growth company, consistent with AMD’s high cost and high capital turnover (relative to NOPAT)
4. **Cost of Capital:**  A cost of equity of 9.6% is used (risk-free rate: 3.8%, equity risk premium: 4.5%, beta: 1.10) and a cost of debt of 2.27%.  With a targeted capital structure of 15% debt, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 8.6%.
5. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity growth method with a terminal growth rate of 3% and the WACC of 8.6%.

**Discounted Cash Flow Analysis:**
Following the assumptions and methodology as described in the provided *Valuation* book by McKinsey, a projected income statement and balance sheet were created for years 2023-2032. Projected free cash flow and economic profit (as well as ROIC and reinvestment) were derived from these, and finally the valuation was completed.  
An additional layer of pessimism was added to the valuation by considering the potential for failure and the consequent discount on terminal value using the following formula:
*Value = Probability of Survival x Value as a Going Concern + Probability of Failure x Distress Sale Value*
Given AMD's credit rating of BBB+, the probability of distress over 10 years (2023-2032) is estimated to be 2.7%, and distress sale value is assumed to be 25% of market value.
Combining these pessimistic assumptions leads to a present value of operating assets equal to \$81,112.00 million.
Adding cash and marketable securities (\$4,331.74 million as of 2022) and subtracting debt (\$1,103.44 million as of 2022), the result is an equity value of $84,339.92 million.
Adjusting for minority interests ($0) and other equity claims (unvested employee stock options granted before 2022 valuation date: \$1,000 million) and dividing by outstanding shares (1,245.65 million) yields a value per share of \$67.76. This value, in conjunction with AMD’s trailing stock price, indicates a company trading at a slight premium to fair value, and not enough to convince an intrinsically motivated investor to buy at current prices.  Furthermore, uncertainty regarding future growth and profitability, and high expectations at the current share price are added reasons to justify a pessimistic view. 

**Important Considerations**

* The semiconductor industry is subject to rapid innovation and disruption.  Therefore, any valuation of AMD is inherently uncertain.  The true test of the valuation will come in how AMD performs and adapts over time.
* Any change in management or acquisitions, even accretive ones, can have an impact on valuation. A careful analysis should precede any investment decisions involving growth rates, margins, and ROIC/reinvestment for AMD after 2023. 
* Be wary of using today's price-earnings (P/E) ratio to justify a high valuation for AMD, based on expectations of future growth.  P/E ratios can be extremely volatile, especially for young companies like AMD, and should not be the sole basis for an investment decision.  Focus on the company's long-term competitive advantage, cash flows, growth, and ROIC when making investment decisions.
* Do your own diligence. The numbers and model provided here are for illustrative purposes only. It is imperative to do your own research and come up with your own estimates.
