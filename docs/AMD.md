>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

I'm assigning a moat rating of 2/5. Here's why:

* **Narrow Moat:** AMD benefits from some cost advantages and customer switching costs in specific niches, particularly in servers and high-performance computing. Its products are highly integrated into customer systems, making it difficult and expensive to switch to a competitor. However, these advantages are not insurmountable.  
* **Competitive Landscape:** The microprocessor and GPU markets are highly competitive, with large, entrenched incumbents like Intel and Nvidia. While AMD has made significant market share gains in recent years, these gains are partially a function of execution missteps by its competitors.  There is no guarantee that these gains will be sustainable over the long term.  As Lisa Su mentioned in the Q2 2023 earnings call, "While we are very, very pleased with our share gains in the data center business . . . we expect that to continue to be a competitive market." (See *Measuring the Moat* and *Competitive Advantage* in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_).  Moreover, the microprocessor industry is intensely cyclical, and AMD has faced multiple near-death experiences in the past. This cyclicality limits the durability of any competitive advantage.  Intel and Nvidia also possess the ability to lower prices whenever they need to in order to defend their market share, making it difficult for AMD to charge more than its products' costs justify.
* **Intangible Assets:** Although AMD has well-known brands, brands alone rarely create a durable competitive advantage unless they confer pricing power.  AMD's brand is not strong enough for consumers to pay a premium relative to similar competing products.   AMD's main reliance is on product quality and innovation, and both are tough strategies to sustain for a long period, which adds to risk. (See *Intangible Assets* in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_).  It also needs to be recognized that much of AMD’s success in the past decade has come from competitors’ stumbling. 

**Management:**

I'm giving management a rating of 3/5. Here's why:

* **Strengths:** CEO Lisa Su has demonstrably improved the company's operations since becoming CEO in 2014. AMD has gained market share and is producing innovative products. Dr. Su communicates clearly and candidly about the business. AMD's financial strength has also materially improved with excess cash now available for acquisitions and buybacks. She has shown a prudent hand on capital allocation.
* **Weaknesses:**  Executive compensation seems high. For instance, in fiscal 2023 Dr. Su received total compensation exceeding $29 million.  Also, insider ownership remains relatively low, with directors and officers owning less than 1% of the company's shares. (See _The Essays of Warren Buffett_ and *The Big Boss* in _The Little Book That Builds Wealth_). Although Dr. Su often refers to a long-term approach, AMD does change its accounting principles and policies from time to time, which does not necessarily demonstrate a focus on long-term results. (See _The Intelligent Investor_). 

**Catalyst:**

I'm giving AMD a catalyst rating of 3/5. The recent acquisition of Xilinx gives AMD access to several new markets, including embedded systems and data centers. In addition, the company's new processor designs give it a competitive edge in the PC, server, and game console markets.  These new products and markets are potential catalysts for AMD's stock price. However, competition remains intense, and there is no guarantee that AMD will be able to fully capitalize on these opportunities. (See *From Cradle to Grave* in _The Little Book of Valuation_).

**Valuation:**

I estimate a fair value of $120 billion.  Here's my valuation methodology:

* **Method:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) (See _The Little Book of Valuation_ and _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies_).  This method is selected because DCF is the most robust and flexible valuation approach.
* **Key Inputs:**
    * **Cash Flows:** Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) (See _The Little Book of Valuation_).
    * **Growth:** 2.5% terminal growth rate. This assumes growth converges on the risk-free rate in stable growth.
    * **Cost of Capital:** 8% weighted-average cost of capital (WACC). This is derived using a bottom-up beta approach, adjusting for operating and financial leverage.
    * **Margin:** Estimated by taking the industry average adjusted operating margin for the semiconductor industry (based on Standard & Poor's and Morgan Stanley estimates), and by projecting moderate margin improvement.
    * **Reinvestment Rate:**  Estimated using sales growth from AMD’s guidance and earnings calls, coupled with historical values for the industry, and projected ROIC.
* **Key Assumptions and Calculations:**
    * I used AMD's quarterly and annual reports (10-K and 10-Q filings) for financial data, 2021-2023. (See _The Little Book of Valuation_ and _Valuation_.)
    * I obtained AMD’s cost of capital using long-term growth rates supplied by the company in annual reports, earnings calls and press releases. Cost of capital is 8%.
    * In its guidance, AMD forecasted that revenue growth rate would be about 10% for years 1-5. Using earnings call guidance and my own judgement, I estimate that in stable growth (after year 5) AMD's revenue growth rate will stabilize at 2.5%. These growth assumptions are not guaranteed, and AMD may be unable to fully exploit this market. The assumptions are reasonable given AMD's history and market position.
    * I used a bottom-up beta approach to come up with a beta of 1.3 and then adjusted for financial leverage to arrive at a cost of equity of 11.7%.
    * I calculated AMD's free cash flow (FCFF) for 2021–2023, making adjustments for deferred taxes and capitalizing R&D. These calculations are based on a simplified version of accrual accounting. Specifically, depreciation is not adjusted. (See _Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies_.) 
    * I calculated FCFF by starting with after-tax operating income and change in non-cash working capital for 2021–2023. 

| Year | FCFF |
|---|---|
| 2021 | $2.23B |
| 2022 | $2.55B |
| 2023 | $4.01B |

* Using these FCFF numbers, the cost of capital of 8% and the growth rate of 2.5% in perpetuity, I valued the firm at $120 billion. (See *Estimating Continuing Value* in _The Little Book of Valuation_). 
* I did not use relative valuation (multiples) because they are more affected by market moods and contain much more noise than DCF valuations.  (See _The Intelligent Investor_ and _The Little Book of Valuation_).
* I did not build an option valuation model, because for AMD, flexibility is not as important a driver of value creation as for young firms with limited cash flows.  (See *Valuing Flexibility* in _The Little Book of Valuation_.)


**Concerns and Controversies:**

* **PC Market Slowdown:**  The PC market, a significant portion of AMD's revenues, has experienced a slowdown in recent quarters.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, Dr. Su acknowledged this slowdown, stating that "the PC market remains weak."  She expects "inventory corrections to continue through the second half of the year" and "some modest recovery in the PC market" to begin in the second half of 2024.  This is a major concern, as the PC market has historically been highly cyclical.  If the PC market remains weak for an extended period, it could hurt AMD's revenue and earnings.
* **Competition:** The competitive environment in both the microprocessor and GPU markets remains intense. AMD has been gaining market share, but Intel and Nvidia are formidable competitors with deep pockets and a history of innovation.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, Dr. Su addressed the competition from Intel's new AI chip by stating, “So, let’s just say, they're all talking to us."  The outcome of the competition between AMD, Intel, and Nvidia will have a major impact on AMD's future.
* **Debt Levels:** AMD's debt load has increased significantly in recent years, primarily due to the Xilinx acquisition. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, Ruth Cotter, AMD's Chief Financial Officer, stated that the "company ended the quarter with gross cash and short-term investments of $3.3 billion and total debt of $2.48 billion.” Though the company can easily service this debt given current interest rates, if the company’s cash flow weakens, its ability to service its debt payments, and potentially reinvest in R&D, could be compromised. (See *Can Changing Management Change Value* in _The Little Book of Valuation_.)

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Xilinx Integration:** The successful integration of Xilinx could lead to significant revenue and earnings growth. Xilinx's products are complementary to AMD's, and the combined company has a broader product portfolio and a larger addressable market.  (See *Mergers and Acquisitions* in _Valuation_). The Xilinx acquisition was finalized in February 2022 and AMD has had two and half years to incorporate Xilinx’s assets and financials into its own.  (See _Acquisitions and Synergy Benefits_ in the Proxy Statement).
* **New Product Launches:** AMD's new processor and graphics card designs have the potential to further boost the company's market share.  In its Q2 2023 earnings call, AMD mentioned that its new MI300 data center accelerator product line was “on track to launch later this year”. The company also discussed an expansion of its Pensando DPU portfolio called “Pensando Elba” in this same earnings call.  New and improved products could lead to an increase in customer demand, a price premium, and/or enhanced profit margins, each of which could give the company a competitive advantage over its rivals.  (See *Acquisitions and Synergy Benefits* in the Proxy Statement). 
* **Cloud Computing Growth:** AMD is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of the cloud computing market. The company's data center processors are gaining share, and its products are used by many of the major cloud providers.  In the Q2 2023 earnings call, Dr. Su stated that, "In the data center business, we saw revenue grow significantly year over year and sequentially, driven by both cloud and enterprise."  If this trend continues, it could be a significant catalyst for AMD's stock.


**Final Thoughts:**

AMD is a company with some compelling growth opportunities, but it also faces some significant challenges. The competitive landscape is intense, and the company's debt levels have increased significantly.  The stock's valuation is based on optimistic assumptions about future growth.  If these assumptions do not materialize, the stock could be significantly overvalued.  A more cautious approach would be to wait for a larger margin of safety before investing in AMD.
