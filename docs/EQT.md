EQT Corporation is a natural gas production company with substantial, albeit geographically concentrated, proved reserves in the Appalachian Basin. While it enjoys some advantages from this concentration, these advantages do not meet the criteria for a wide moat.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

EQT benefits from **economies of scale** and **cost advantages** stemming from its large and contiguous acreage position in the Marcellus and Utica shales. This affords some protection from competition and allows for efficient operations. As mentioned in *Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies*, these factors can create sustainable competitive advantages. However, these advantages are limited. 

- **Threat of new entrants:** The barriers to entry in natural gas production are relatively low (relative to industries like pharmaceuticals or railroads), as demonstrated in *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*.  Any company with sufficient capital can acquire leases and develop wells. The threat of new entrants increases during periods of high natural gas prices and decreases during down cycles.
- **Bargaining power of buyers and suppliers:** EQT faces bargaining power from both buyers and suppliers. Large pipeline companies can exert pricing pressure, and smaller producers are often forced to sell to these larger players. Similarly, oil services companies can increase their prices for equipment and services, squeezing EQT's margins. As Porter notes in *Competitive Advantage*, strong suppliers and buyers can diminish profitability.
- **Substitute products:** Natural gas faces competition from other energy sources, including renewables. This substitution risk, discussed in *The Intelligent Investor*, limits pricing power and potential returns.

Therefore, while EQT possesses *some* competitive advantages, they are narrow and not sufficiently durable to warrant a moat rating higher than 2.

**Management (3/5):**

EQT's management has a mixed record.

- **Capital allocation:** Recent acquisitions, like the acquisition of Chevron's Appalachian assets in 2020, and the purchase of Tug Hill and XcL Midstream in 2023 have increased EQT's scale and improved its competitive position.  However, as discussed in *Valuation*, acquisitions often destroy value, and there's no guarantee that these deals will create value for EQT shareholders in the long run.  The company's large debt load, resulting from these acquisitions, adds substantial financial risk. As Michael Burry's writings highlight, financial leverage is a double-edged sword.
- **Investor communication:** EQT provides detailed information in its SEC filings and earnings calls. However, its communication often focuses on short-term results (like earnings per share), rather than long-term value creation, as emphasized in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*. For example, in the Q1 2023 earnings call, management focused more on hitting free cash flow targets than on explaining the company’s long-term strategic vision.
- **Compensation:**  Executive compensation appears to be largely tied to the company's stock price, potentially encouraging short-term thinking.  As we see in Burry's writings, excessive focus on short-term price movements can be dangerous.
- **Insider ownership:** Moderate insider ownership provides some assurance of management's commitment to shareholder interests, but it's not exceptionally high.

Given the preceding factors, EQT's management receives a 3/5 rating.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

Potential catalysts for EQT include:

- **Higher natural gas prices:** As a commodity company, EQT’s fortunes are intrinsically linked to the price of natural gas.  A sustained increase in prices would increase profitability and cash flow. As seen in Michael Burry’s article on the purchase of Calpine, a commodity business is often sensitive to price.
- **Increased demand for natural gas:**  Growing demand for natural gas, both domestically and internationally, could drive higher production and improve profitability.  EQT’s management is optimistic about future natural gas demand, as indicated in the Q1 2023 earnings call and in the *Morgan Stanley Measuring the Moat* report.
- **Debt reduction:** As natural gas prices and company’s profitability improve, management expects the ability to pay off debt and improve the company’s balance sheet health, as stated in the Q1 2023 earnings call. Debt reduction reduces financial risk and could increase equity value.
- **Efficiency gains:** The company is looking for various cost savings and improvement programs, as stated in the Q4 2023 earnings call.  

However, these catalysts face headwinds, including the cyclical nature of the natural gas industry, the increasing role of renewables, and regulatory uncertainty. 

**Valuation ($14.12 billion):**

Using a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, I arrive at a fair value of $14.12 billion for EQT.

**Assumptions:**

- **Explicit forecast period:** 5 years.  EQT operates in a mature industry, as noted in the *Morgan Stanley Measuring the Moat* report. This simplifies financial projections, as seen in Michael Burry’s trading journal entries.
- **Revenue growth:** Gradually decrease revenue growth from its 2023 annual rate to the long-run U.S. GDP economic growth rate, which I forecast to be 2.5% annually in the *medium term* (from 2024 through 2028). I expect EQT's EBITDA margins and capital expenditures to remain stable for the explicit forecast period, but acknowledge that these measures have varied for many commodity companies over recent decades, making it even more difficult to value them using DCF.
- **Cost of capital:** 9.0%. Based on current market data (risk-free rate, market risk premium, and beta). 
- **Terminal value:**  Apply the “key value driver” formula detailed in *Valuation*. Apply a RONIC (Return on New Invested Capital) equal to WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital), as a measure of the difficulty for mature companies to achieve excess returns, and a stable growth rate for NOPLAT (net operating profit less adjusted taxes) equal to WACC, as discussed in *Valuation*.

**Calculations:**

1. **Free cash flow (FCF) forecast:** Forecasted using projected operating income, taxes, depreciation, capital expenditures, and working capital, as described in *Valuation*.
2. **Terminal value:**  Computed using the FCF in the last year of the explicit forecast period and the stable growth rate.
3. **Present value of FCF and terminal value:** Discounted at the cost of capital.
4. **Value of nonoperating assets:**  EQT has substantial cross-holdings, a typical practice in this industry. For example, in the *Morgan Stanley Measuring the Moat* report, both Heineken and Tata Motors hold equity interests in other firms.  I treat the nonoperating assets as “excess” cash that could immediately be used to pay off debt or repurchase shares.
5. **Enterprise Value (EV):** Sum of the present values of FCF and terminal value, plus the value of non-operating assets.
6. **Equity Value:** EV minus market value of debt.
7. **Value per share:** Equity value divided by number of shares outstanding.

| **Natural Gas** |  |  |
| Proved developed reserve | 14,742 | 20,265 |
| Proved undeveloped reserve | 2,894 | 2,838 |
| Total proved reserve | 17,636 | 23,103 |

{: .important }

Given recent improvements in EQT's margins, management may be overestimating the company's potential for earnings growth and therefore the value creation, given the large debt load and the need for reinvestment in existing wells. This might be due to the incentive managers have to inflate their results, as we know from the writings of Micheal Burry.


{: .note }

There are some potential catalysts that could impact EQT's valuation in the coming year or two, including a sustained increase in the price of natural gas caused by factors like production cuts from major producers, rising LNG exports, or a colder than usual winter.  However, these catalysts face headwinds including the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine causing disruptions in energy markets and supply as well as the Paris Agreement.
