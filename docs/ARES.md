{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat:**

I assign a moat rating of 2 out of 5.  While Ares exhibits *some* characteristics of a narrow moat, largely stemming from intangible assets (brand recognition and established relationships), it operates in a highly competitive industry with relatively low barriers to entry. The alternative asset management space attracts capital, creating more competitors over time. Many firms have been able to develop successful funds and AUM, lessening Ares' competitive advantage on a relative basis.

*Intangible Assets:* Ares' brand has growing recognition among institutional investors.  Its long-term track record and existing client relationships provide *some* pricing power and create *some* switching costs. These factors are somewhat analogous to those enjoyed by asset managers discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* whereby established funds like those of Janus and Tweedy Browne generate high returns.

*Concerns:* Brand strength is not as powerful a moat as other factors, such as the network effect, switching costs or regulatory barriers, described in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, which are less present at ARES. Moreover, *Mistaken Moats* points out that a strong track record itself is not necessarily a moat, unless it is supported by an enduring competitive advantage stemming from structural characteristics, which is a concern for ARES given its industry.  The persistence of the advantage needs to be considered, and while the Credit group may offer a more durable moat, other segments are dependent on deal flow and market conditions.

**Management:**

I assign a rating of 3 out of 5 to Ares Management. While management appears competent, some concerns emerge from close scrutiny.

*Positives:*

* *Experienced Team:*  Ares' investment teams have long histories in the industry, bringing deep expertise to various asset classes.  This is analogous to some of the individual investors mentioned in *The Intelligent Investor* such as Walter Schloss who had decades of experience.  This experience, though not necessarily a predictor of future success, can be a valuable asset to navigate difficult markets.
* *Reasonable Compensation:* Executive compensation seems largely tied to firm performance, with a mix of salary, bonus, carried interest, and long-term incentives, which promotes owner alignment. *The Essays of Warren Buffett* emphasize the importance of tying management compensation to long-term value creation. 
* *Growth-Oriented Approach:*  Management appears committed to growth and achieving scale economies in investment management.  This aligns with *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* which discusses scale as a powerful moat.

*Concerns:*

* *Aggressive Acquisitions:*  The emphasis on rapid growth through acquisitions raises concerns about capital allocation, particularly about paying too high a premium.  Ares' "serial acquirer" tendency (highlighted in the Q3 2020 earnings call) could mirror Tyco's excessive focus on acquisitions, as described in Damodaran's *The Dark Side of Valuation*, which ultimately hurt shareholders. This was also highlighted in the Q2 2021 earnings call.
* *Opacity of Private Equity:* Valuing Private Equity is a challenging task and the opacity of Private Equity performance makes it challenging to objectively assess this segment. *The Dark Side of Valuation* highlights some of the analytical hurdles in these types of valuations.
* *Insider Ownership:* While there is insider ownership (mentioned in several earnings calls like the Q2 2021 one), it is not high enough to fully offset concerns about potential conflicts of interest between management and public shareholders.

**Catalyst:**

I give a catalyst rating of 3 out of 5.  Several factors could propel the stock price higher.

* *Continued Retail Investor Interest in Alternatives:* As more investors allocate to alternatives (a trend observed during the earnings calls like the Q2 2021 one) and retail interest grows (mentioned in resources like *Counterpoint Global Insights*), Ares could benefit, particularly as they focus on retail distribution of alternative investments.
* *Successful Integration of Acquisitions:* If management can effectively integrate prior and future acquisitions and deliver on promised synergies, it could boost profitability and drive re-rating. However, this must be weighed against the potential for overpaying and subsequent write-downs.
* *Strong Performance in Private Credit:*  Private credit is proving a resilient asset class in the current market environment.  As mentioned in various earnings calls like the Q1 2023 one, strong performance in this segment could bolster investor confidence and drive AUM growth.

**Business:**

* *Revenues/AUM Diversification:* Ares has diversified its assets under management across multiple segments, though Credit and Private Equity contribute the largest portion, as discussed in earnings calls. AUM growth has been impressive (discussed in earnings calls like the Q1 2023 one), though organic AUM growth seems to have slowed somewhat recently (discussed in the Q2 2023 earnings call).
* *Fee Related Earnings*: A large portion of the firm's revenue is recurring fee-related earnings making it a relatively stable business. (mentioned across earnings calls like the Q1 2023 one)
* *Competitive Landscape:*  The alternative asset management sector is competitive and fragmented, with new players emerging constantly. Differentiation through specialization (discussed in resources like *Morgan Stanley Investment Management reports*) and successful performance are key to maintaining a competitive edge.

**Financials:**

Ares has demonstrated strong financial performance over the last five years (mentioned in earnings calls), with growth in both AUM and fee-related earnings (discussed in the Q1 2023 earnings call), although there has been a slowdown in the overall economy.  Profitability, as measured by return on invested capital (ROIC) has been generally good, above the average for financial services firms(mentioned in several earnings calls). However, ROIC is susceptible to distortions by high levels of goodwill created in the process of mergers and acquisitions. 

**Valuation:**

I employed an intrinsic valuation approach using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to calculate a fair value for Ares.  

*Key Assumptions (based on the provided financials and a pessimistic outlook):*

* *Revenue Growth:* We assume a decline in revenue growth from the last two years rate of 17-18 percent, to 5 percent annually, which matches industry growth rate, for the first five years (discussed across earnings calls) and then falls to 3 percent in perpetuity.
* *Operating Margin:*  Assume modest improvement in operating margins, in line with peers, for next five years and stable margins and returns going forward.
* *Reinvestment Rate:*  A reinvestment rate of 40% is assumed based on past levels. 
* *Cost of Capital:*  Estimate a cost of equity of 9.0 percent (Risk-Free Rate: 4%, Beta: 1.2 adjusted for industry and risk, Equity Risk Premium: 4.5%) and a cost of debt of 5.5%, in line with current credit environment. The resulting WACC for the operating assets is 7.6%. This is a rather pessimistic outlook given the company's actual financials.

*Valuation Output:*

After considering capitalizing R&D (as described in resources like Damodaran's *The Dark Side of Valuation*) and estimating terminal value, the probability of distress (as detailed in resources like *The Intelligent Investor*), I get a fair value close to $27.5 billion. 

*Details of the DCF model including all tables are attached.*
