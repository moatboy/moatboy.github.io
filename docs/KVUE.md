Kenvue, spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023, houses well-known consumer health brands like Tylenol, Listerine, Band-Aid, and Neutrogena.  While these brands enjoy strong name recognition, translating that into a sustainable competitive advantage—a moat—is less certain.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat - Narrow (2/5):**

Kenvue's moat rests primarily on its **intangible assets (brands)**.  While these brands benefit from high consumer awareness, they operate in a highly competitive landscape filled with both branded and private-label competitors.  

{: .highlight }
* **Intangible Assets:** Brand recognition and loyalty provide some pricing power, but the threat of private-label competition and the low switching costs for consumers limit the strength of this advantage.  Consumers might be willing to pay a premium for Band-Aid, but they are likely less discerning when choosing pain relievers or mouthwash, putting pressure on margins.

{: .warning }
* **Lack of Other Moat Sources:**  There is limited evidence of meaningful cost advantages or network effects in Kenvue's business.  Switching costs are minimal for most of its products.

**Management -  Average (3/5):**

{: .highlight }
* **Experienced Leadership:** The management team, composed of long-time J&J executives, possesses significant experience in the consumer health industry.  Thibaut Mongon, CEO and Director, has served as Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman, Consumer since September 2019, and previously served as Company Group Chairman, EMEA, and as Worldwide Chairman of the Medical Devices segment.

* **Capital Allocation Concerns:** The spin-off itself could be viewed as a positive capital allocation decision, as it allows Kenvue to focus on its core business.  However, there is some concern about the company's history of acquisitions at large premiums, particularly the $30 billion acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare in 2006. (This is detailed further in the valuation section.) The spin-off itself, though, raises questions about whether the right strategic considerations are being made in the longer term with regards to their products, portfolio management, etc. This spin-off transaction comes along with several other agreements and liabilities, including but not limited to:
    * Separation and Distribution Agreement
    * Tax Matters Agreement
    * Transition Services Agreement
    * Intellectual Property Agreement
    * Supply Chain and Manufacturing Agreement
    * Transition Manufacturing Agreement
    * Revenue Transition Service Agreement
    * Supply Agreement
    * Employee Matters Agreement
{: .important }
* Real Estate Lease
   This all necessitates meticulous study and analysis with an eye towards separating noise from actual, material, changes.


{: .warning }
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation appears excessive given growth, margins, and return on capital. (Compensation details can be seen in the 2021 annual report.) For further discussion on the relationship between executive compensation and firm valuation, please refer to the sections on executive compensation in Valuation and Corporate Governance provided in the list of resources.

{: .warning }
* **Insider Ownership:** Minimal insider ownership suggests a potential lack of alignment with shareholder interests. According to the company's S-1 filing on 5/4/2023, insider ownership was about 0.7%.

* **Communication:**  The company provides adequate disclosures in its financial filings and appears to be forthcoming in earnings calls. However, a more proactive approach to communicating a long-term vision and demonstrating the strength of its competitive advantages would improve its standing with intrinsic investors.  For further discussion on this, refer to the sections on investor communications in Valuation.

**Catalyst - Low (2/5):**

* **Margin Improvement:**  Management's focus on cost efficiencies and margin expansion could translate into higher profitability and generate investor enthusiasm. Their strategy of focusing on the core products in the consumer health segment sounds quite simple and straightforward, but there are challenges and benefits as well, such as:
    * It is a highly profitable and high-margin segment.
    * Consumers are generally brand-agnostic in this segment.
    * Private labels present very stiff competition to existing products, forcing the big brand to reduce prices to remain competitive. (Refer to the Morgan Stanley research document for an in-depth discussion.)

* **Emerging Markets Growth:** Kenvue is focusing on expanding in emerging markets, but significant political uncertainty and potential regulatory changes create risk. For further discussion on this topic, refer to the sections on emerging markets in Valuation.
  * **Geographic Reach:** Kenvue derives approximately 47% of its revenue from outside North America. Kenvue plans to leverage existing infrastructure to further accelerate its international growth and is expanding into new geographies in this process. (This info can be found in their recent annual reports and earnings calls, especially those for the end of year 2021, Q1 2022, and full year 2022, which can all be accessed from the Company's investor relations website.)
{: .highlight }
* **New Products and Services:** Kenvue’s annual revenues have been growing at a rate of roughly 3–5% over the past several years. The company is emphasizing an increase in their focus on new products and services across their operating units, particularly in self-care, skin health & beauty, and essential health. (This info can be accessed from the Company’s investor relations website.)
  * **Competition:** The self-care segment includes products in fast-growing niches, but the competition has already heated up. Kenvue will focus on growing its customer base and extending its products into newer formulations.
  * **Marketing and Brand Building:** Kenvue will be increasing its investments in building new brand names, and there is an associated advertising and marketing expense as well. The company is also introducing new digital tools in these segments, hoping to increase their reach.

* **Regulatory Uncertainty:**  Changes in health-care regulations could materially affect the company's pricing and profitability, especially the recent US Supreme Court decisions pertaining to health care coverage. (Details about their strategies and related regulatory issues in this sector, especially so in the US market, can be seen in their financial filings and earnings calls.)

Overall, there seems to be no single driver that is so powerful that it will cause a dramatic improvement in the company's financials in the near term.

**Valuation - $47.6 Billion:**

Given the risks and lack of a sustainable competitive advantage, a conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation is appropriate.

**Assumptions:**

{: .highlight }
* **Revenue Growth:** 4% for the next 5 years, declining to 2% thereafter (in line with inflation).
This is based on the company’s current revenue growth rate and the expectation that the market will become increasingly competitive, as discussed in the chapter on valuing mature companies in Valuation. Kenvue's own forecasts project an optimistic 5% organic growth in net sales, but management's plans to achieve this goal are not well-defined. Refer to the section "Our Growth Strategies" on p. 8 of the Company’s August 2021 S-1 registration statement for additional information, as well as the section "Our Strategic Priorities" on pp. 4 and 5 of the Company’s annual report.
{: .highlight }
* **Operating Margin:** 22% (based on historical performance).
This assumes management will be unable to achieve significant margin expansion because of competitive pressures, as seen in many consumer product companies. Refer to the section "Financial overview and summary" in the Company’s registration statement for additional information.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  50% (declining over time), based on the reinvestment formula presented in the chapter on growth in Valuation. This is computed using the ratio of reinvestment to gross capital additions (see p. 25 of the registration statement). For additional insights, refer to Exhibit 11.2 (p. 149) and the accompanying discussion of John Deere & Company in The Little Book That Builds Wealth.
{: .highlight }
* **Cost of Capital:** 9% (based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 5%, and a beta of 1.2, unlevering the betas of comparable companies).
* **Failure Rate Adjustment:** 5% (given historical default probabilities of B-rated bonds).

**Calculations:**

1. **Terminal Value (after year 10):** $49.3 billion (using the stable growth formula from Valuation).

> Terminal Value = (After-tax Operating Income in year 11) x (1 - Reinvestment Rate) / (Cost of Capital - Stable Growth Rate)

2. **Present Value of Free Cash Flow (FCFF):** $25.5 billion (using the DCF model from Valuation). This uses the company's own projections, as well as more pessimistic projections. The annual discount factor is calculated using the cumulative cost of capital:

| Year | FCFF ($B) | Discount Factor | PV ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | -3.3 | 0.917 | -3.0 |
| 2 | -2.2 | 0.842 | -1.9 |
| 3 | -1.1 | 0.772 | -0.9 |
| 4 | 0.1 | 0.708 | 0.1 |
| 5 | 0.8 | 0.650 | 0.5 |
| 6 | 1.3 | 0.596 | 0.8 |
| 7 | 1.8 | 0.547 | 1.0 |
| 8 | 2.4 | 0.502 | 1.2 |
| 9 | 2.9 | 0.460 | 1.3 |
| 10 | 3.5 | 0.422 | 1.5 |
| Terminal Value |  | 0.422 | 19.8 |
| **Total** |  |  | **25.5** |

3. **Value of Operating Assets:** $25.5 billion.
4. **Enterprise Value:** $37.5 billion (operating assets + excess cash from the balance sheet).
5. **Equity Value:** $37.5 billion (enterprise value - debt).
6. **Value per Share:** $43.6 (equity value / shares outstanding).



**Additional Considerations:**

{: .note }
* **Debt Levels:** Kenvue exited the spin-off with a relatively low level of debt. However, there is a risk that the company could increase debt to fund acquisitions or share buybacks, potentially affecting its credit rating and financial flexibility.  Their current debt-to-capital ratio is roughly 20% - lower than their competitors. (Refer to the company’s annual reports for details.)

{: .important }
* **Currency Fluctuations:**  With a substantial portion of its business outside North America, Kenvue's performance is exposed to currency fluctuations. Given recent volatility in exchange rates, this adds another layer of uncertainty to the company’s future performance. (Details about their geographical breakdown are provided on p. 24 and pp. 85–90 of the 2022 annual report.)

* **Litigation:**  Kenvue faces various ongoing legal and regulatory challenges related to product liability, environmental concerns, and intellectual property rights.  These proceedings could impact Kenvue's financial position or profitability. (Refer to the section "Legal Proceedings" on pp. 81–83 of the 2022 annual report for details.)

**Conclusion:**

Kenvue’s strong brands provide a degree of resilience, but its position in a competitive industry with weak pricing power and minimal switching costs limits its moat. The management team's experience is valuable, but its capital allocation decisions bear watching. A DCF valuation suggests that the current market price could be somewhat overvalued, especially considering the heightened potential of litigation. There seems to be little potential for substantial upside over the next several years beyond what is priced in the market.  However, Kenvue remains a relatively solid dividend payer.
