Pessimistic value: $22.2 B

HPE operates in a competitive and rapidly evolving technology landscape, making it a challenging company to value. While it has some elements that resemble a narrow moat, these are not sufficiently robust to warrant a higher rating. The management team shows a mixed track record, deserving of a moderate rating. There are some potential catalysts for share price appreciation, though not strong enough for a high catalyst rating.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

HPE's business model, focusing on providing servers, storage, networking, and related IT services, presents a limited moat. 

* **Switching Costs (Moderate):**  While there are some switching costs associated with enterprise IT infrastructure (as discussed in Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*), these are not as significant as in other industries. Customers can, and do, switch IT providers, although it involves time and resources. The evolution of cloud computing and "as-a-service" models reduces lock-in further as migration becomes easier. As Antonio Neri, HPE's CEO, said in the Q4 2020 earnings call, "As-a-service is about choice", acknowledging the increased customer power in a cloud-based environment.
* **Intangible Assets (Low):** HPE does invest in R&D, but its patents and technological edge do not create substantial barriers to entry. Competitors frequently introduce similar products and services, eroding any technological advantage HPE might temporarily achieve.
* **Cost Advantages (Low):**  Scale economies in manufacturing are limited given the commoditized nature of some hardware components and the rise of cloud services. Competition from both established and emerging players keeps margins under pressure.
* **Network Effect (Minimal):** While HPE benefits from its size and existing customer base, there is no significant network effect that locks in customers or creates a virtuous cycle of growth.

**Management (3/5):**

HPE's management is rated moderately, considering the following factors:

* **History/Experience (Mixed):**  Antonio Neri has been with HPE for many years, serving in various leadership roles before becoming CEO.  However, the company has undergone significant restructuring during his tenure, including the spin-offs of HP Inc. and DXC Technology, raising questions about long-term strategic vision. (As discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett* the effectiveness of management can be judged over long periods of time to judge the true effectiveness, and in HPE's case the long-term track record is still developing.)
* **Capital Allocation (Moderate):** HPE has pursued acquisitions (e.g. Cray, Nimble Storage) and divestitures (e.g. software business), with mixed results. Their capital return policy, primarily share repurchases, seems to be a reaction to market conditions rather than a consistent long-term strategy. (As Michael Burry demonstrated in his investment approach, managers often use repurchases opportunistically, not always strategically.) The Q4 2022 earnings call highlighted the ongoing share repurchase program with $11 billion authorized by the board, but with a limited comment on underlying fundamentals.
* **Communication (Moderate):**  While management provides regular updates and guidance during earnings calls and investor events, the level of detail and transparency about long-term value drivers could be improved.  (Inspired by Michael Burry's detailed analysis of financial documents, a closer look at the annual reports shows limited discussion about how HPE plans to deliver superior returns beyond short-term operational improvements.)
* **Compensation (Neutral):** Executive compensation is linked to stock performance, but there is no clear evidence of excess payouts or misaligned incentives. 
* **Insider Ownership (Low):** Insider ownership is relatively low, reducing management's skin in the game. 


**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Edge Services Growth:** HPE is focusing on growing its edge services business, which could provide a catalyst for revenue and earnings growth in the coming years. The Greenlake platform, as discussed in Q1 2023 and Q4 2022 earnings calls, is central to this strategy. HPE sees edge as having "$20 billion of annual potential" (Q1 2021). However, this is still a nascent market, and the company faces intense competition.
* **Improving Margins and Cost Control:** The company has embarked on cost-cutting measures and improving operational efficiency. Management has mentioned this in several earnings calls. Success in these initiatives could enhance profitability and investor sentiment.
* **Transition to "As-a-Service":** The shift to a subscription-based model could lead to more predictable revenue streams and higher valuations in the long run.  However, this transition is still in its early stages.
* **Improving economic conditions:** As a global company, HPE is exposed to a variety of macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds. As the world comes out of the current economic downturn, and as interest rates settle down, HPE could see strong tailwinds and improvement in their earnings.

**Valuation ($22.2 billion):**

A three-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to estimate HPE's intrinsic value, with a high degree of conservatism in the inputs to account for the challenging and competitive landscape. Given HPE's mix of mature and growing businesses, a multi-stage DCF model is deemed the most appropriate for capturing the complex dynamics, as highlighted in McKinsey's *Valuation*.  Additionally, as discussed in *The Intelligent Investor*, being conservative with the valuation is crucial.


**Assumptions:**

* **Stage 1 (2024-2028):** Revenue growth gradually decreases from 10% (Q4 2022 guidance for FY23 organic revenue growth) to 5%. Operating margins improve to 15% (from around 10% today) due to cost cutting, which might be overly optimistic given competition. HPE continues to reinvest at around 50% of earnings.
* **Stage 2 (2029-2033):** Revenue growth converges to the long-run growth rate of the economy (assumed to be 3%), as it would for any company in a relatively developed economy, as discussed in Aswath Damodaran's *The Little Book of Valuation*. Reinvestment rate drops to 30%, with margins stabilizing at 17%, both of which might be optimistic.
* **Stage 3 (2034-Perpetuity):** Growth matches long-term inflation at 2.5%. Reinvestment rate drops to 10%. Margin stays at 17%. (These numbers would be reasonable even for a company like Unilever as seen in their notes and in previous chapters of their financial filings.)
* **Cost of Equity:** Risk-free rate of 4%, equity risk premium of 5.5% (current market conditions, though this may be optimistic, and can change significantly in the future), unlevered beta for sector of 0.8, total beta of 1.0, industry average debt-to-equity of 35%, and debt-to-equity for HPE of 60%.
* **Cost of Debt:** 7%. (Based on current BBB+ rating.)
* **Tax rate:** 25% (U.S. statutory rate, rounded).


**Calculations:**

* **WACC:** 7.6%
* **Terminal Value:** $41.255 billion. (NOPLAT<sub>2033</sub> * (1 â€“ reinvestment rate stable)/(WACC - g)), reinvestment rate stable = g/RONIC (in stable growth))
* **Value of Operations:** $24.3 billion. (Sum of discounted free cash flows + discounted terminal value).  


**Adjustments:**

* **Cash:** HPE has a cash balance of $4.1 billion (October 2023 HPE financials).
* **Debt and Lease Obligations:** HPE has total debt and lease obligations of $12.3 billion (October 2023 HPE financials).
* **Minority interests:** HPE's minority interest, typically at a multiple of income or earnings, is estimated at $0.601 billion. 

**Value of Equity:**

$24.30 + $4.10 - $12.30 - $0.601 = $15.5 billion (approximation)

* **Shares Outstanding:** HPE has approximately 1.235 billion shares outstanding (Q4 2022).

**Value per share:**

$15.5/1.235 = $12.55/share

**Value of Firm:** $15.50 + $12.30 = $27.8 billion (approximation)

**Recent Concerns:**

* **Supply Chain Disruptions:** HPE, like many other technology companies, has been impacted by supply chain disruptions.  Management has addressed this issue in recent earnings calls, such as Q1 2023 and Q4 2022,  and is working to mitigate its impact on operations. (As seen in Burry's analysis, external factors can affect the company's business and should be accounted for)
* **Inflationary pressures:** Rising prices have impacted profit margins, especially in hardware. Tarek Robbiati, HPE's CFO, discussed the expectation of moderating inflationary pressures in the Q4 2022 earnings call, along with improving supply chains and pricing power. (This is important in determining whether the current cost structure is sustainable or if additional price adjustments will be necessary).

>The value per share estimate and market price from July 2023 are $15.9 and $14.5 respectively. The significant difference between the two presents an interesting opportunity.

This discounted cash flow valuation relies on conservative assumptions and presents a baseline estimate.  However,  significant changes in the macroeconomic environment,  success/failure of growth initiatives, and competitive pressures could lead to vastly different outcomes. (As discussed in McKinsey's *Valuation*, sensitivity analysis is important.) Building a range of scenario-based valuations would provide a more robust and complete picture of HPE's potential.
