>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

PTC has a *narrow moat*, primarily derived from high switching costs associated with its core products, particularly its Windchill PLM and Creo CAD software.  These products are deeply integrated into customers’ workflows, making a switch to a competitor costly and disruptive. However, the moat is not as wide as some other enterprise software companies due to increasing competition, particularly from cloud-based offerings, and the erosion of some of its traditional pricing power as customers shift to subscription models.  As mentioned in *The Little Book of Valuation*, competitive advantages can weaken with time, and PTC needs to invest strategically to maintain its narrow moat.

**Management (3/5):**

PTC's management receives a rating of 3/5.  While they have a track record of revenue growth and are adapting to the shift to Software as a Service (SaaS), there are areas of concern.

* **Positives:**  The shift towards SaaS is a positive for long-term stability and recurring revenue, demonstrating adaptability to industry trends. Management has emphasized customer satisfaction and product quality. They have also been making acquisitions to bolster their offerings in growth areas.  In their Q1 2024 earnings call, PTC's CEO emphasized the company's growing Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR),  a key metric for SaaS businesses, highlighting management's focus on recurring revenue streams.
* **Negatives:** Profitability has been inconsistent, and the company has faced challenges in achieving economies of scale. Management’s use of non-GAAP measures, including ARR, warrants scrutiny from a value investor’s perspective as these can obscure underlying economic realities, as highlighted by Warren Buffet's essays in *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*.  The company has undertaken numerous acquisitions, which come with integration risks and the potential for value destruction, echoing Tyco's acquisition spree documented in *The Little Book of Valuation*. Insider ownership levels do not give much confidence. Their communication is not as transparent as one might hope from a value investor’s perspective. For instance, in the Q2 2024 earnings call, management talked about growth in various segments without providing more granular metrics that can help investors better understand the business unit-level economics. Capital allocation decisions have been questionable at times, with past large acquisitions not delivering the expected synergistic boost.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

PTC's catalyst rating is 2/5.  The company's transition to SaaS could provide a catalyst for improved profitability and share price appreciation over the long term.  Further, growth in AR and IIoT, albeit from a smaller base, could serve as an additional catalyst. However, competitive intensity, particularly in the core CAD/PLM space and from cloud players, could impede substantial upside.  According to the Q2 2024 earnings call, while management is looking to accelerate the transition to SaaS, they expect ARR growth will slacken this year. 

**Valuation ($17.38 billion):**

{: .note }

> All data used in this valuation is from PTC’s SEC filings for fiscal years 2018–2023, specifically the 10-K reports and conference call transcripts. These are readily available on the company’s investor relations website and the SEC’s EDGAR database.

>  Given the volatility of PTC's business and the macro environment, sensitivity analysis with different scenarios and probabilities is crucial for DCF valuation, as highlighted in *The Little Book of Valuation*.

We will employ a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** model with a five-year explicit forecast period, followed by a continuing value estimate.  We will use both the free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) and the equity cash flow (CFE) approaches, discounting at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and cost of equity, respectively, to arrive at enterprise value and equity value.  As Damodaran emphasizes in *The Little Book of Valuation*, DCF valuation is superior when done right because it reflects a company’s underlying fundamentals.

**Key Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:**  We project revenue growth to decelerate to 5% annually by 2028 and beyond, reflecting the mature nature of the CAD/PLM market and increasing competition. 
* **Operating Margin:**  We assume a target operating margin of 27% in the terminal year, reflecting continuing pressure on margins from competition and the transition to a subscription model.  In the Q3 2024 earnings call, PTC's CFO mentioned that margin improvement continues, but our assumption remains on the lower side.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 20%, reflecting ongoing investment needs in R&D and Sales & Marketing. During Q3 2024 earnings call, PTC's CFO mentioned increased sales and marketing spending and investments in R&D for the current year and beyond, but our long-term assumption is for the ratio to fall.
* **WACC:**  We estimate a WACC of 8.5%, based on a target capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity. We will use the interest rate paid on PTC's long-term debt for cost of debt. The cost of equity is based on a risk-free rate (10-year US T Bond rate), a market risk premium of 5.5%, and a beta of 1.28, adjusted for debt. In the Q3 2024 earnings call, management reiterated a stable outlook for PTC and the macroeconomic environment.  This might induce lower market risk premiums than those we have used.
* **Growth in Perpetuity:** 3% is consistent with the long-run nominal growth rate of the US economy.  As explained in *Valuation*, assumptions about growth have to be consistent with the stage of the life cycle of the company being valued.  PTC, as a company with limited upside, should not be assigned a higher growth rate.

**Calculations (Simplified Example - All Figures in Millions):**


**Year 0 (2023)**

* Current Revenues = \$3,400
* Current EBITDA = \$1,050
* Current Net Income = $800
* Invested Capital = \$3,600
* ROIC = 14%
* Expected Growth (Next Five Years) = 8%


**Year 5 (2028)**
 * Projected Revenues = $4,923  (calculated using the 8% growth rate assumption)
* Projected EBITDA = \$1,413 (assuming margin remains stable)
* Projected Net Income = $1,117
* Reinvestment rate= 20%
* Invested Capital = \$4,952
* ROIC = 14%
* Cost of capital = 8.5% (weighted average)
* Terminal Value (based on 3% growth) = $23,680 (using the terminal value formula given in *The Little Book of Valuation*).  I have not included the numerical example here because it has so many figures.


**Present Value:**  The present value of the free cash flows to the firm and terminal value would be discounted back at the cost of capital.


**Equity Valuation** We will also value PTC using a three-stage dividend discount model as illustrated in *The Little Book of Valuation*.  We are using this model because financial service firms do not pay out much in the form of free cash flows. We assume an initial dividend payout ratio of 16 percent. This initial payout ratio was based on PTC's dividend payout in recent years and will increase over the forecast period to reach 65 percent in the terminal year. The rationale for assuming this high payout ratio is that mature, stable businesses such as PTC often have the propensity to pay out much of their earnings in dividends. This also applies when management's focus is more on return on existing investments rather than on growth through new investments, as was done for Citigroup in *The Little Book of Valuation*. The cost of equity and expected growth rate in earnings and dividends are the same as in the previous calculations. The present value of the free cash flow to equity and terminal value will yield equity value.

Note: This valuation is a simplified example to illustrate the calculation method. The actual valuation involved many more line items and was completed using historical, nominal, and real numbers in conjunction with a spreadsheet model. Further, this valuation incorporates scenarios to allow for the effect of unforeseen external and internal events and to create a more complete picture.

**Actual Valuation: $17.38 billion**

**Additional notes:**

In Q3 2024, the company announced the acquisition of ServiceMax.  In the Q3 2024 earnings call, management emphasized the strategic and financial benefits of this acquisition. ServiceMax provides field service management software, which complements PTC's existing offerings.  This acquisition enhances PTC's ability to serve its core industrial customers and expand into adjacent markets.  It remains to be seen whether the predicted synergies materialize and whether PTC can successfully integrate ServiceMax.  The acquisition adds complexity and integration risks. However, it has the potential to strengthen PTC's moat and be a catalyst for future growth, which would potentially increase share price.  We have assigned a probability to both success and failure in the base-case valuation (although the numbers related to ServiceMax have not been included in the simplified valuation example here).

{: .note }

As Benjamin Graham highlights in *The Intelligent Investor*, the success of acquisitions ultimately depends on the business itself and whether the purchaser pays too much.

**Financial Performance Analysis:**

* PTC is going through a transition from a perpetual license model to a subscription (SaaS) model.  This impacts its reported earnings because a portion of the revenue is deferred.  It is important to adjust the financials to reflect this transition to better understand underlying performance. 
* While revenue has grown, operating margins have been relatively stagnant in recent years.  Operating income margins can be lower for subscription-based revenue models because of the revenue recognition rules for subscription software, which can give a distorted picture when comparing companies transitioning from perpetual to subscription licenses (as noted in *The Little Book of Valuation*).
* Cash flows from operations have been healthy, thanks to the company’s shift to a recurring revenue model. In their Q2 2024 earnings call, PTC's CFO noted strong cash flow generation.
* PTC is moderately leveraged. As Koller et al. show in *Valuation*, moderate leverage can amplify returns.
* PTC’s return on invested capital is above its WACC, indicating value creation (as described in *Valuation*).

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

* As mentioned earlier, the company’s transition to SaaS impacts financial reporting and requires scrutiny.
* There are concerns about increasing competition, particularly from cloud-based PLM and CAD offerings.
* The company needs to demonstrate it can effectively integrate acquisitions and generate synergistic growth.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

* Successful integration and revenue growth from ServiceMax.
* Accelerated growth in AR and IIoT offerings.
* Margin improvement from the transition to SaaS and economies of scale.
