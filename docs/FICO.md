{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

FICO's moat stems primarily from its **intangible assets**, specifically its brand name and the network effect surrounding the FICO score. Lenders and borrowers alike are familiar with and trust the FICO score, creating high **switching costs** for lenders.  While FICO's brand carries significant weight, it's not unassailable. The rise of alternative credit scoring models and data sources, like those incorporating banking transactions, represents a long-term threat. Hence, a rating of 3 out of 5 appears reasonable, reflecting a solid but not impenetrable moat. As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, brand recognition alone doesn't guarantee pricing power, as we see with consumer electronics brands.  FICO's moat is further strengthened by network effects, with increasing user numbers adding to the perceived value of the score, although this aspect is very much tied to their intangible asset, the brand name.

**Management (3/5):**

FICO's management receives a middling rating of 3 out of 5. Positives include a history of consistent profitability and strong free cash flow. They also demonstrate clear communication with investors during earnings calls, willingly answering questions and addressing concerns. In the Q4 2022 earnings call, for instance, management addressed concerns about score usage and growth in professional services and software segments.  However, FICO's capital allocation decisions have been mixed, with some questionable acquisitions and a less than impressive record on acquisitions and buybacks. The company's growth rate has also been relatively slow. Executive compensation, while not excessively high, is not tied directly to intrinsic value creation (as discussed in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*), and insider ownership is moderate. This raises concerns about alignment with shareholder interests. As highlighted in *Valuation*, management should be evaluated not just on reported earnings but also on their ability to translate earnings into sustainable cash flows that enhance intrinsic value. FICO's history in this regard has been decent, but nothing that would support a premium rating.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

FICO's catalyst rating is a moderate 2 out of 5. The company's expansion into new markets and product areas, such as cybersecurity and fraud solutions, holds some potential. The increasing adoption of digital channels for banking and lending could also drive future growth for FICO Scores. For example, in the Q4 2023 earnings call, management emphasized the role of FICO scores in digital account openings and buy-now-pay-later platforms. FICO is also well-positioned to benefit from ongoing industry consolidation. However, these catalysts are counterbalanced by competitive pressures and the company's relatively slow historical growth rate.

**Business and Financials:**

* **Revenues:** FICO operates in two main segments: Scores and Software. Scores segment revenues come from FICO Score usage, while the Software segment comprises pre-emptive decision-making solutions and solutions designed to improve revenues. Scores segment is a high-margin, stable business, whereas the Software segment is faster-growing but lower margin. Total revenue has exhibited slow and steady growth over the past several years with the exception of 2020 which saw a big drop in revenues, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various industries and its associated ripple effects.
* **Margins:** Operating margins in the Scores segment are very high, exceeding 60 percent, and significantly higher than other large companies such as Alphabet and Meta, but lower in the Software segment. This aligns with its high fixed costs business model. However, intense competition may squeeze these margins over time.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The credit scoring industry is dominated by a few large players, with FICO being the most dominant in the U.S. However, competition is intensifying, and FICO has been gradually losing market share. In the Q4 2023 earnings call, management acknowledged competition in areas like credit card originations. This necessitates continual innovation and expansion into adjacent markets, both of which pose challenges for a relatively large and bureaucratic organization. As discussed in *Competitive Strategy*, mature industries often see declining growth rates, forcing companies to focus on efficiency and innovation.
* **Financials:** FICO boasts a strong balance sheet, high returns on capital, and consistent free cash flow.

**Valuation ($11.9 billion):**

A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, the most reliable valuation tool as discussed in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Co, was employed to determine a fair value estimate for FICO. The following assumptions were used:
{: .highlight }

*A 2% revenue growth rate over the next 5 years (decreases to 1% by terminal year) reflecting limited overall market growth and competitive pressures.
*Operating margins rise gradually from 38% to 40% in the next 5 years given expected cost optimization and operating leverage with margins remaining at this normalized level in perpetuity.
*Reinvestment rate falls to 10% by year 10 and remains at that normalized level.
*Cost of capital of 9%  to reflect market risks and FICO's business characteristics.


> These assumptions were used given FICO’s mature business profile, the current macroeconomic environment, competitive pressures in the credit scoring industry, and FICO’s management history in this regard has been decent, but nothing that would support a premium rating.

> To estimate future free cash flow, a five-year explicit forecast was constructed, followed by a continuing value assuming stable growth in perpetuity using the key value driver formula, as recommended in *Valuation* and *The Little Book of Valuation*.  Conservative assumptions were favored throughout the analysis to account for the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance, as emphasized by both valuation books. This is especially important because earnings growth rates decline for most growth companies once they mature.

Using these inputs and discounting the projected cash flows back to their present value resulted in an equity valuation of approximately $11.9 billion.
{: .note }

This number represents a significant drop from the company's recent market capitalization, suggesting that the stock is overvalued relative to its fundamentals, further aligning with our pessimistic outlook.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

FICO has faced some criticism in recent years, primarily focused on the potential misuse of credit scores and questions about fairness and transparency.  There are also concerns about its legacy scoring models' effectiveness in the changing credit landscape.  Management has addressed some of these concerns in earnings calls, but some uncertainty remains. These factors were taken into consideration when selecting the inputs for the valuation.

**Potential Upcoming Catalysts:**

> Beyond the already mentioned catalysts, FICO is actively working on enhancing its decision management suite. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, FICO's President and CEO, William Lansing, stated that the company is committed to bringing the best platform capabilities together, which includes enhancing its strategy execution software, an area that we believe is very much within our sweet spot.
