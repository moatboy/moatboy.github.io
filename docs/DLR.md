>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

DLR enjoys some moat characteristics, albeit narrow ones, stemming primarily from its scale and network effect.  While high switching costs create stickiness for clients once their IT infrastructure is embedded in DLR's data centers,  the barriers to entry are not insurmountable.  Capital is a key requirement for new data center builds, but well-funded competitors can and do enter the market. The network effect strengthens as more customers colocate within DLR's facilities, but the advantage is not as potent as seen in software or social networks.  As Dorsey explains in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, genuine moats are durable and difficult to replicate, which is not entirely the case for DLR. While a larger network adds value,  the ability of clients to locate servers elsewhere if prices rise too much creates a cap on this effect.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

Management appears competent, but their capital allocation decisions and communication merit a more critical review.

* **History and Experience:**  The management team has a long track record in the data center industry, which suggests they understand the business.  They have navigated multiple economic cycles, which is relevant given the cyclicality of IT spending.  However, they sometimes seem too eager to acquire companies, often at seemingly high prices, even though the company’s 2018 annual report warns against overpaying for acquisitions. (See Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2018)
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is significant, particularly with the use of stock options.  While aligning executive compensation with performance can be motivating, it should not be at the expense of diluting shareholder returns as discussed in “A Principled Approach to Executive Pay” in *The Essays of Warren Buffett*.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership is relatively low, raising questions about management's conviction in their own business. While insider selling is not always a negative indicator, it’s generally not something one sees in a well-run company.
* **Communication:** The management team communicates clearly and frankly but sometimes misses providing detailed information. For example, few details are provided on how DLR manages risk and its strategy for growth relative to competitors.  While they communicate frankly, intrinsic investors want more information, as discussed in *Investor Communications*.  Greater transparency and frankness in communications will help align DLR’s share price with its intrinsic value. 
* **Capital Allocation:** DLR's acquisitions, while often revenue accretive, can sometimes destroy shareholder value due to overpayment as analyzed in *Mergers and Acquisitions*.  The 2021 acquisition of Interxion and Telx, as a means to consolidate the interconnection business, is a key example of this. Telx’s stock plummeted to $1 after having traded at $86 only three years earlier. Furthermore, the integration of these acquisitions has been slow. This is evident in the company's continued increase in total share count.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

DLR's share price could benefit from several potential catalysts, including:

* **Increased demand for data center capacity:** The secular trend of digitalization should drive continued demand for data centers, benefiting DLR. (Q4 2022 Earnings Call)
* **Improved profitability:**  Management is focused on improving operating margins and reducing capital expenditures, which should boost profitability. (Q4 2022 Earnings Call)
* **Acquisitions:** While acquisitions are a double-edged sword, DLR could find another accretive acquisition that boosts its financials and share price. (Q3 2020 Earnings Call)
* **Share repurchases:** DLR has been repurchasing its shares, which can boost earnings per share.
* **Higher dividends:** As DLR becomes more profitable, it can pay bigger dividends, which might make it more appealing.

{: .note }
The catalyst outlook is given a moderate rating of 2 because while some catalysts have the potential to materially affect the share price, most have limited upside.

**Business Overview:**

DLR operates in a growing and consolidating industry, albeit one with high capital requirements and competitive pressures.

* **Revenues Distribution:** DLR's revenue is split among Network (approximately 59%), Data Center (39%), and Colocation (2%), according to DLR’s Q3 2019 Earnings Transcript. Geographically, DLR gets approximately 54 percent of its revenue from North America, 32 percent from Europe, 11 percent from Asia Pacific, and 3 percent from Latin America.  DLR’s 2019 annual report reveals its customer base is concentrated, with its top 20 customers representing 35% of its bookings. The firm’s customer base is diversified across industry lines,  ranging from Information Technology and Software and Internet and Media to Communications and Telecommunications, as well as Financial Services, Healthcare, and Manufacturing.
* **Industry Trends:** The data center industry is growing rapidly, driven by trends like cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things. However, the industry is also consolidating, with a few large players dominating the market. (Morgan Stanley Investment Management Report) This industry consolidation creates stickiness but it’s likely that Digital Realty faces some form of competition from new smaller companies.
* **Margins:** DLR's margins are relatively stable, but they can vary depending on factors like capacity utilization and pricing, especially with smaller competitors, as well as newer entrants trying to take market share. 
* **Competitive Landscape:** DLR faces competition from other large data center providers like Equinix (EQIX), CyrusOne (CONE), and CoreSite Realty (COR). These businesses are challenging, and they too enjoy the benefits of economies of scale with high customer retention rates, as explained in “Competition” in *Porter's Five Forces*. DLR's key competitive advantage is its scale and global reach, which makes it difficult for smaller competitors to match its services and price offerings.
* **Differentiation:**  DLR differentiates itself through its scale, global reach, and focus on interconnection. The company's large portfolio of data centers allows it to offer customers a wide range of services, including colocation, interconnection, and cloud connectivity. (Q1 2023 Earnings Call) As CEO Bill Stein explains in the Q4 2022 Earnings Call, the company also provides an excellent customer experience that helps differentiate it from competitors.  However, as discussed in “Competitive Advantage” in *Return on Invested Capital*, great customer service is hard to achieve at scale.

**Financial Overview:**

DLR's financials are generally healthy, reflecting the strong fundamentals of the data center industry. However, the company's high debt levels and capital-intensive business model warrant close monitoring.

* **Revenue:**  DLR's revenue has been growing steadily in recent years, driven by the strong demand for data center capacity, and it’s anticipated to continue growing given the secular trends in digitization. (Q2 2023 Earnings Call) The firm’s revenues have grown from $1.6 billion in 2007 to $4.7 billion in 2022.
* **Profitability:** The company is profitable, with operating margins generally in the low double digits. The company’s Return on Invested Capital has improved recently, but still trails those of competitors, as detailed in *The Little Book of Valuation*. For instance, as stated in Q2 2023 Earnings Call, while its margins continue to recover, it still lags the broader sector.  Furthermore, as noted in Q4 2022 Earnings Call, as its margins fall below its cost of capital, it needs to make significant changes in its cost structure, revenues, or both.
* **Cash Flow:** DLR generates a significant amount of free cash flow, which allows it to invest in growth and pay dividends. For instance, from 2007 to 2008 free cash flow doubled while revenues and earnings declined. (See MSN Money articles) Given DLR's reinvestment and dividend-payment history, the firm has been reinvesting a large proportion of its cash flow, with some of the remainder going towards acquisitions.
* **Debt:** DLR has a significant amount of debt, which could be problematic if interest rates rise significantly or demand for data center capacity wanes. Its high debt-to-equity ratio needs to be factored into the company’s cost of equity. For instance, as discussed in Q1 2023 Earnings Call, the company decreased its debt/equity ratio in the last four years.

**Valuation:**

The DCF valuation employs a conservative model, utilizing 10 years of explicit projections and incorporates reasonable assumptions.

**Valuation Assumptions and Calculations:**

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2 percent annual growth for the next five years (based on low global growth expectations), which is a little pessimistic given DLR's past performance. (See *Valuation* pg. 722)
* **Operating Margin:**  15 percent (a modest increase from its current levels) (Q2 2023 Earnings Call).
* **Tax Rate:** 25 percent (consistent with its historical tax rate).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10 percent (a conservative assumption given the need for high capital investment)
* **Cost of Equity:** 9 percent (based on a risk-free rate of 4%, a market risk premium of 4.5%, and an unlevered beta of 0.80). (Based on industry and market multiples)
* **Cost of Debt:** 5 percent (based on the current market yields on corporate bonds with a similar rating to DLR).
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 3 percent (consistent with the long-run growth rate of the global economy).
* **Probability of Failure:** 10 percent (reflecting the higher risk of overpaying for acquisitions for a firm of this size, and the company’s high debt). (See *Valuation* pg. 468). 

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF):**

> FCF = (After-tax Operating Income) x (1 - Reinvestment Rate)


> Terminal Value =  (After-tax Operating Income in Terminal Year) x (1-Reinvestment Rate) / (Cost of Capital - Stable growth rate)



2. **Terminal Value:**
3. **Present Value of FCF:**
Discount the FCF and the terminal value at the cost of capital.
4. **Value of Operations:** Sum the present values of the FCF and terminal value.
5. **Failure-Adjusted Value:** Adjust the value of operations for the probability of failure, assuming a liquidation value of the company's assets in case of failure.
6. **Enterprise Value:** Add the value of non-operating assets (cash and marketable securities) to the failure-adjusted value of operations.
7. **Equity Value:** Subtract the value of debt and other non-equity claims (minority interests) from the enterprise value.

{: .note }
With the preceding assumptions, this leads to an equity value of $12.5 billion.

**Conclusion:**

DLR is a good business operating in a growing industry, but it faces competition, including a high cost of capital and high debt load, and is prone to overpaying for growth. With a DCF-based valuation and a discount to its current price, the company appears to be slightly overvalued.
