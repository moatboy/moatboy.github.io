**Business Overview:**
Snap Inc. operates primarily through its social media platform, Snapchat. While it is known for its messaging and camera features, the company's core business model revolves around its advertising segment. This segment leverages the unique ways in which people use Snapchat, especially its camera functionality, to generate revenue, primarily by inserting advertising to users and creators. Snapchat is primarily used by younger demographic, which is a significant target audience for many advertisers.
The company also operates other product lines, including Spotlight, a short-form video content platform, and AR glasses for creators (Snap Spectacles).

**Revenue Distribution & Industry Trends:**
Snap's revenue is predominantly derived from advertising sales, which is divided into direct-response (DR) and brand advertising. DR advertising focuses on quantifiable results, like app installs or website traffic, whereas brand advertising focuses on general awareness. There is a trend in the industry where companies are increasingly using DR as opposed to brand advertising due to effectiveness tracking. A majority of Snap's business is based in North America and Europe; international operations account for about 30% of the total revenues.
The mobile advertising market is fast-growing, with a growing trend towards personalized and immersive advertising formats (such as AR), as well as a general shift towards social commerce, where people buy products directly from social media platforms. The industry is highly competitive, requiring tech companies to constantly innovate and meet the demands of users and advertisers alike.

**Competitive Landscape:**
Snap competes intensely with larger technology companies such as Meta (Facebook, Instagram) and Google (YouTube) for both users and advertising dollars. TikTok, which focuses on short-form video content, is a fast-growing competitor that has made inroads with Snapchat's target demographic. While the core experience across these platforms is different, there is a very large overlapping user base. In addition, the company also competes with other platforms and companies for advertising revenue, including Twitter (X) and Pinterest.

**What Makes the Company Different?**
Snap's primary differentiator is its focus on mobile camera and augmented reality (AR). Snapchat's core feature, the camera, is used as the primary way for users to communicate, and as such there is a unique level of interaction from users with the platform. Snap is also focused on younger audiences. This is particularly beneficial for the advertising side of the business as this younger age group is often desired by advertisers. Furthermore, the company continues to innovate in AR and other technologies, even while facing high competition.
The use of the camera as the main feature and the usage of AR makes their app very unique from others and that brings an advantage that competitors have to make an effort to copy.

**Financials:**
Snap Inc.'s recent financials show that the business is still in growth phase.
The company’s most recent earnings report (Q3 2023) showed revenues of 1.19 billion USD which was a 5% growth from a year ago but a decline of 6% sequentially. Daily active users continue to grow, reaching 406 million by the end of Q3 2023, an increase of 10% YoY.
The company has a high cost of revenues (43% of revenues), due to costs associated with ad serving, bandwidth, and content creation. Operating costs, including R&D, Sales & Marketing, and General and Administrative expenses, all consume a large portion of their revenue, resulting in losses. Snap’s net loss in Q3 was 368 million dollars.
A large part of the expenses are tied to stock-based compensation. Operating cash flow has been negative for many recent years. Free cash flow, while positive recently, is very volatile and inconsistent. The balance sheet is not perfect but it is relatively strong. The company has around $3.6B in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which is a positive and also gives room to invest for future growth and deal with uncertainties.
Snap is a growth company that may not always be profitable and is also highly impacted by the advertising market.

**Moat Rating: 2/5**
Snap has certain competitive advantages, but they aren't very durable or difficult to copy. 
The network effect is in play as the more users the platform has, the more attractive it becomes, especially to younger audience. The ability to innovate and provide creative experiences in AR, also gives Snap a moat against competitors.
The switching costs on Snapchat are not particularly high which makes it easy for users to switch to competing apps if they provide better features or advertising experience. Also, there is no brand loyalty that makes it very hard for a user to use another app, that also poses a risk to Snap.
The company’s economic moat is quite weak but still present-it is not easy to replicate Snap and the camera usage that they have promoted. Overall, the moat is not very strong, it is a narrow moat.

**Legitimate Risks:**
1.  **Intense Competition:** The competition in social media and advertising market is high and constantly changing, which could impact the overall share and growth of Snap’s business. In particular, newer social apps, like TikTok, have an enormous pull in the younger demographic, leading to a big challenge for Snap.
2. **Advertising Revenue Fluctuations:** As Snap is primarily dependent on advertising revenue, it is heavily affected by any market turndown or advertising budget cuts. Economic downturns are particularly impactful.
3. **Reliance on Data:** Regulatory changes and increased concern for user data privacy may harm the advertising revenue of the company. This means that they will have to rely less on their targeted marketing and focus more on non-targeted brand marketing which can impact the effectiveness and profitability of their ad segment.
4. **Lack of Profitability:** While showing some top-line growth, Snap is still unprofitable. They have also faced heavy operating losses. If this continues to be the case, shareholders might feel frustrated and sell their stocks.
5. **Unproven AR and Spectacles Investments:** The company’s investments in AR and Spectacles are still in early stages and their success is unproven. These ventures may fail and harm the overall company’s profitability.
6. **Reliance on Snap Camera:** A large part of SNAP's business is based on use of their camera and the usage of Snapchat by the userbase. If the camera feature become outdated, the company will have to find new ways to make their app attractive and generate revenues.
7. **Dependence on Major Platforms:** Snap relies heavily on Google and Apple's platforms for distributing and promoting its services. Any changes to the rules of these platforms could significantly impact SNAP's reach and userbase.

**Business Resilience:**
Snap has a good base of daily active users that consistently use the platform and is relatively loyal. This base provides a foundation that can be used to develop new business lines. Snap has also shown willingness to experiment and innovate with AR and other new technologies. This has created a brand and a user base that is unique from its competitors. Finally, the company has a fairly good amount of cash that provides financial flexibility in the short term.
However, as the company is mainly dependent on their advertising segment they will always be susceptible to changes in advertising demand and a more volatile stock price.

**Understandability: 2/5**
Snap is not easy to understand due to its complex business with many different aspects. A main part of the revenue is through their advertising segment, but it is hard to understand it in details. The company’s business also has a strong technology element with their AI and AR, and that also brings complexity to the valuation of the company. Understanding the company’s complex accounting process and financials also makes this not very easy to understand. Overall, the understandability of the company and its business is a 2 out of 5.

{: .note }

**Balance Sheet Health: 3/5**
Snap’s balance sheet is not the strongest but it also is not too weak either. Snap is carrying $3.6B in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also is not carrying any significant amount of debt, indicating that the debt profile of the company is strong. Cash flows of the company are volatile, and they need to improve to consider the business as truly strong in financial terms. While there are no major red flags from the balance sheet, a rating of 3 out of 5 is appropriate.
