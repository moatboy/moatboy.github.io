Moat: 2/5

{: .label .label-yellow }

Pessimistic value: $276.4 B

Tesla's core business is the design, development, manufacturing, lease, and sale of electric vehicles, battery energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services.  While it's tempting to get caught up in the excitement surrounding Tesla and other "story" stocks,  a rigorous approach to valuation requires both qualitative and quantitative scrutiny.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.
**Business Overview:**

Tesla operates in several interconnected businesses, creating opportunities for potential synergies as well as exposing the firm to different risks. Its primary segments are:

* **Automotive:** This includes the design, development, manufacturing, and sale of electric vehicles (Model S, 3, X, Y, Cybertruck, Roadster), as well as associated products and services such as software, Supercharger network, merchandise and insurance.
* **Energy Generation and Storage:** Tesla designs, manufactures, installs, sells, and leases solar energy generation and energy storage products for use in residential, commercial, and industrial markets, including charging infrastructure. 

**Moat Analysis and Rating Justification:**

While Tesla benefits from brand recognition and a passionate user base, its sustainable competitive advantages remain uncertain. 

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Tesla has undoubtedly built a powerful brand image synonymous with electric vehicles and innovation.  However, as Pat Dorsey emphasizes in "The Little Book That Builds Wealth," a brand is only as good as the pricing power it provides.  While Tesla has enjoyed premium pricing in the past, increasing competition from legacy automakers and new entrants threatens to erode this advantage.  Moreover, luxury brands are especially vulnerable to shifting consumer preferences (as mentioned in "Mistaken Moats").  As such, the durability of Tesla's brand premium remains uncertain.

* **Switching Costs:** While the Supercharger network has provided some switching costs, the emergence of competing charging networks and adapters reduces its effectiveness. Further, the network effect of a charging network is limited by its accessibility to users, and it is likely other EV manufacturers will develop or partner with similar businesses to provide charging networks.

* **Network Effect:**  A network effect can benefit a company whose value or service increases with the number of users. This can be observed in American Express, eBay or Microsoft Word, Office, and Windows, as explored by Dorsey. However, the network effects for electric vehicles and charging networks are in their early stages of development. For example, Tesla's struggles in China illustrate how difficult it is for a firm to dominate a market when a major player already exists, or if a firm is relatively new to the industry.

* **Cost Advantages:**  Tesla has made strides in battery technology and manufacturing efficiency. However,  as Aswath Damodaran discusses in "The Little Book of Valuation", cost advantages are often short-lived and can be fleeting, especially in sectors like automobiles. As technological development in batteries progresses, the likelihood of Tesla sustaining these advantages is low.

* **Size Advantage:** Tesla is growing, but it is still much smaller than its established competitors, limiting the potential for cost advantages associated with economies of scale. For example, it has a far easier time creating cost advantages than older model car companies due to technological improvements.

Given the uncertainty surrounding brand durability, limited switching costs, nascent network effects,  and the potential for cost advantages to be replicated by competitors, a moat rating of 2/5 reflects a narrow, and potentially weakening, competitive advantage.

**Valuation:**

Estimating a fair value for Tesla requires significant caution given its high growth, volatility, and the uncertainties attached to its various businesses.  Applying a pessimistic lens to the process leads to a valuation of **$276.4 billion** based on the following assumptions and a discounted cash flow model:

**Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume declining revenue growth over the next ten years, beginning with a high growth period with a higher reinvestment rate, followed by lower growth and an eventual stability phase.
* **Operating Margin:**  We assume that Tesla's operating margin will eventually stabilize, but the path to profitability is uncertain given current market volatility.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We use a dynamic reinvestment rate, varying across the high-growth and stable phases to accommodate changes in capital requirements.

**Calculations:**

1. **Estimate free cash flow to the firm (FCFF):**

* **High Growth Period:** Revenue growth decreasing from 8.72% to 4% over ten years. Operating margins increasing from 7.33% to 14%. Reinvestment rate beginning at 115.68% and declining to 26.67%.
* **Stable Growth Period:** Revenue growth of 3%. Operating margin of 14%. Reinvestment rate of 26.67%.


2. **Estimate cost of capital:**  We use a risk-free rate of 4.09% (10-Year Treasury Bond rate in June 2021), a beta of 1.73, an equity risk premium of 4%, a tax rate of 25%, and a cost of debt of 4.5%, weighting the cost of equity and cost of debt at 75% and 25%, respectively. This results in a cost of capital of 9%.


3. **Compute the present value of the free cash flows:** Discounting the estimated cash flows back to the present value at a cost of capital of 9%.


4. **Compute the present value of the terminal value:** Assuming a stable growth rate of 3% and a cost of capital of 9% for the terminal year.


5. **Sum the present value of the free cash flows and the present value of the terminal value.**


6. **Adjust for other factors:** Add back cash, subtract debt, and account for outstanding equity options to arrive at the value of equity.


7. **Divide the value of equity by the number of shares outstanding to get the value per share.**


**Additional Considerations:**

* **Competition:** Tesla faces intense competition from both established automakers and new entrants, increasing pressure on margins and pricing.
* **Execution Risk:** Tesla's expansion plans are ambitious, and there is considerable uncertainty about the company's ability to achieve its targets.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Tesla operates in a highly regulated industry, and changes in government policies could negatively affect its operations.

**Caveats:**

* Valuation is inherently subjective and imprecise, and there are significant uncertainties associated with the assumptions used in this valuation.
* Past performance is not indicative of future results, and there is no guarantee that Tesla will achieve its growth and profitability targets.


This valuation represents a pessimistic view of Tesla's future prospects, particularly given the recent stock price action.  It is essential to maintain a margin of safety when investing in Tesla, recognizing the potential for downside risk if growth or profitability underperforms expectations.
