>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


1. **Risk & Insurance Services:** This segment, generating approximately 56% of MMC's 2022 revenue,  provides advice and solutions related to risk management through insurance and reinsurance broking. They offer expertise in placement, claims advocacy, and other risk and insurance advisory work. This segment primarily serves large multinational businesses, public and private institutions, and middle-market companies throughout the world. It operates through Marsh (insurance and reinsurance broking) and Guy Carpenter (reinsurance intermediary).

2. **Consulting:** This segment, representing approximately 44% of MMC's 2022 revenue, offers consulting services through Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group. Mercer's focus is on human resources and related financial advice and services, while Oliver Wyman specializes in management, economic, and brand consulting. They primarily serve large multinational corporations, governments, and private and not-for-profit organizations, offering them expertise in talent, health, retirement, and investments. This segment's revenues come primarily from fees for services.

**Industry Trends and Competitive Landscape:**

The insurance broking and consulting industry has faced increasing consolidation in recent years, with larger firms gaining market share. This trend creates economies of scale in marketing and administration. Marsh and Guy Carpenter benefit from these scale advantages and hold a strong market share and global presence. The consulting sector also benefits from the increasing demand for specialized human capital and strategic advice.

**Margins:**

Both segments generate relatively high operating profit margins, exceeding 20 percent on average over the past five years. These high margins, exceeding industry averages, reflect the specialized services offered and strong pricing power in the industry.

**Moat Analysis:**

MMC exhibits a narrow moat, primarily based on intangible assets and switching costs.

* **Intangible Assets:** The Marsh and Guy Carpenter brands are highly recognized and respected in the insurance broking industry, giving the company an advantage in attracting and retaining clients. This brand recognition reflects the company's long history, expertise, and global presence.

* **Switching Costs:** Clients, especially large multinational corporations, often develop long-term relationships with their insurance brokers and consultants. Switching providers can be disruptive and time-consuming, as it requires significant effort to establish new relationships, transfer data and systems, and learn new processes. 

> {: .note} The nature of MMC’s business creates stickiness, which translates into a competitive advantage.

MMC's moat is not impregnable. New competitors continue to enter the consulting market, and clients are cost-conscious. Therefore, MMC’s moat is given a rating of 3 out of 5. It is a good moat but not an exceptional one.

**Valuation:**

To value MMC, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used. This model estimates the intrinsic value of a business by discounting the expected future free cash flows (FCF) to their present value.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  We assume modest revenue growth in the first five years, with revenue growth of 2% a year.
* **Operating Margin:** We project stable operating margins of 25% into perpetuity (slightly lower than current margins, reflecting a cautious outlook). 
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate of 10%, based on historical levels. 
* **Cost of Capital:**  For Risk-Free Rate, we used 10-year US treasury bonds (4.09%). Beta is determined through regression against market returns (.82). ERP used is 5%, yielding a cost of equity of 8.19%. Cost of debt is 2.89% based on company credit rating.  The target capital structure is 25% debt / 75% equity, resulting in a WACC of 7.56%.
* **Marginal tax rate:**  34.4%
* **Failure Probability:** Given MMC’s strong financial position and history, we do not adjust the valuation for a probability of failure.


**Calculations:**

1. **Terminal Value:**
   We calculate the terminal value at year 10 using a perpetuity formula:
   ```
   Terminal Value = (FCF<sub>10</sub> * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
                   = ($4,072.54 * 1.02) / (0.0756 - 0.02)
                   = $73,000 million approximately
   ```

2. **Present Value of Operating Assets:**
   We discount the terminal value and yearly cash flows back to present value using WACC.
   ```
   PV of Operations= $29,507 million approximately
   ```

3. **Enterprise Value:**
   We arrive at the enterprise value by summing the present value of operations and nonoperating assets (excess cash). For Marsh & McLennan, non-operating assets primarily consist of excess cash and marketable securities.
   ```
   Enterprise Value = PV of Operations + Nonoperating Assets
                   = $29,507 + $1,750 
                   = $31,257 million approximately
   ```

4. **Equity Value:**

   Equity value is determined by subtracting debt and other non-equity claims from enterprise value.
   ```
   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Debt - Other Non-Equity Claims
               = $31,257 - $11,043 - $0 (employee stock options & unfunded retirement plan)
               = $20,214 million approximately
   ```

5. **Value per Share:**

   The final step is to divide equity value by shares outstanding (493).
   ```
   Value/share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding
               = $20,214 / 493
               = $41 per share approximately
   ```

{: .warning }

>  Due to the fact that the company has considerable investments in other companies, which are accounted for using the equity method, we did not include the financial statements of these companies. Doing so, would reduce shareholder's equity from $20.2 billion down to $11.7 billion, which has significant valuation implications.
Given the stable business model, strong market position, and history of value creation, the fair value of Marsh & McLennan is estimated to be approximately $41 per share, or $20.2 Billion in total equity, which is close to the market price at the time of the analysis.

Given the complexity of valuing professional services companies, this valuation is approximate, and sensitivity analysis is recommended to assess the impact of changes in key assumptions. We have slightly moderated margins and have assigned a lower growth rate than market growth,  which can be justified given increasing competition and global economic uncertainties.
