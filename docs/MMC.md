{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

MMC's moat stems primarily from **intangible assets** (brand name and reputation) and **high switching costs** in its insurance brokerage business.  Its brand, built over decades, carries significant weight in the insurance industry.  Switching brokers for a large company is complex and disruptive, creating inertia. Its consulting business, while less moaty, also benefits from the firm's established relationships and expertise.

However, this moat is narrow.  Competition exists, particularly from other large brokerage houses and smaller, more specialized firms. Technological disruption, though not imminent, remains a possibility, and could erode MMC's competitive position over the long term. As discussed in *Competitive Advantage* from *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, the true test of a brand is pricing power, and while MMC commands a premium, its ability to maintain that premium in the face of increasing competition remains to be seen.  Similar to the banking sector examples in *Valuation*, MMC's business is more opaque than a typical manufacturing company, making it more difficult to assess the strength and durability of its moat.

**Management (3/5):**

MMC's management team receives a moderate rating. Positives include consistent dividend increases over the past 40 years and a focus on share repurchases, indicating a shareholder-friendly approach, as discussed in *Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy* from *The Intelligent Investor*. Additionally, their compensation is largely tied to company performance, aligning their interests with shareholders, as noted by Michael Burry in his journal entries. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, CEO Dan Glaser mentioned a record $2.1 Billion in quarterly revenue as a confirmation of strategy focus. However, there are concerns.  The reliance on acquisitions for growth raises questions, as acquisitions statistically generate limited value, as shown in *Mergers and Acquisitions*. The company's organic growth rate is not particularly impressive. Like many financial services companies, MMC has become less transparent with the use of adjusted numbers, which obscures the true economic performance, as noted in  *Things to Consider about Per-Share Earnings*. Finally, insider ownership, while not negligible, is not exceptionally high.  As Michael Burry demonstrated in his analyses, high insider ownership often provides a stronger signal of management commitment.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

MMC’s catalyst rating is moderate. Continued growth in the insurance and consulting sectors and potential for margin improvement could drive earnings and share price appreciation. The company also benefits from being located in one of the most business friendly states, Delaware, providing a tax-advantaged business environment. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, Glaser discussed the potential for further industry consolidation, hinting at M&A opportunities that could drive growth, though the evidence suggests these do not always deliver the anticipated benefits, as highlighted in *Valuation*.  

**Valuation ($77.5 Billion):**

The valuation is based on a **discounted cash flow (DCF)** model, using a 10-year explicit forecast period, followed by a continuing value.  I am taking a conservative approach by choosing the lower end of estimates. As the McKinsey book emphasizes, intrinsic valuation is the best approach, especially for firms with potential high growth. This method aligns with the value investor's approach of being more concerned with the company's underlying performance than short-term price swings.

**Key Assumptions and Calculations:**

1. **Revenue Growth:**  Based on historical data and management guidance from the Q4 2022 earnings call, assuming a gradual slowing down from a current growth rate of 2% (for next five years), eventually converging to a terminal value growth rate of 3.5%, consistent with forecasts from experts and overall economic growth.  Growth comes primarily from acquisitions as organic revenue growth for the firm remains subdued.

2. **Operating Margin:**  Assuming a gradual improvement from a current operating margin of 25% to 30% (over 10 years), based on historical performance and management’s focus on margin improvement. It aligns with examples in *Valuation* that show margin increases with economies of scale.

3. **Reinvestment Rate:** Estimated using the growth-in-operating-income (growth = reinvestment rate \* return on invested capital) method.

4. **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Estimated at 7.56% based upon a target capital structure of 15% debt (average over the last decade) and 85% equity, reflecting the company’s historical capital structure, a risk-free rate of 3.8%, a market risk premium of 4%, and a beta of 0.92 for the equity. Given the firm's recent bond yields, and the interest rate spread between similarly rated companies and government bonds, estimated using the methodology in *Valuation*, the cost of debt is estimated at 4.27%.


5. **Terminal Value:** Computed using the perpetuity growth model.  The continuing value is a large portion of the total value, consistent with the examples given in the book *Valuation*.

6. **Probability of Failure/Distress:** Considered negligible for MMC given its size, financial strength, and stable business model. No adjustments are made to the base case valuation based on a pessimistic view of low likelihood of failure.
> Considering the company’s size, global reach, and financial strength, it is less likely for it to experience business difficulties than it is for a start-up or a small/medium-sized firm.  This is why MMC is in a better position to survive a downturn than most other firms.
> MMC has a significant competitive position in the insurance brokerage industry. In such industries, the stronger players are much more likely to be bought at attractive prices during economic downturns than at the peak of a business cycle. 

7. **Other Adjustments:** The model includes a small adjustment for nonoperating assets. It assumes that market value is approximately book value, and ignores employee stock options since MMC's options outstanding relative to total market capitalization of the company are negligible, as suggested by *Valuation*.  


**Year-by-Year Free Cash Flow and Discounting Calculations:**

| Year | FCF ($B) | Cum. Discount Factor | PV of FCF ($B) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $1.38 | 1/1.0756 | $1.29 |
| 2 | $1.50 | 1/1.0756^2 | $1.31 |
| 3 | $1.63 | 1/1.0756^3 | $1.33 |
| 4 | $1.77 | 1/1.0756^4 | $1.36 |
| 5 | $1.92 | 1/1.0756^5 | $1.39 |
| 6 | $2.09 | ... | $1.42 |
| 7 | $2.27 | ... | $1.46 |
| 8 | $2.47 | ... | $1.49 |
| 9 | $2.68 | ... | $1.53 |
| 10 | $2.91 | ... | $1.57 |
| TV | $49.316 | 1/1.0756^10 | $23.53 |


**Present Value of Operating Assets = $28.53B**


> The DCF valuation provides a useful comparison of a company's cash flow and links cash flow to growth and return on invested capital.


**Reconciling with Market Value and Per Share Value:**

By adding the present value of FCF ($28.53 billion) and the cash balance from the company's balance sheet (assumed to be $1 Billion), and subtracting the value of debt from the company's balance sheet (assumed to be $2 Billion) we can arrive at the estimated value of equity.

**Equity Value = $27.53 Billion**

Based on the average number of shares outstanding at the company’s previous four quarterly filings, the resulting equity value of $27.53 billion translated to an approximate value per share of **$115** (compared to the actual price of about $180).  
> The discount rate you use should be equal across the various markets you are examining. You may be interested in valuing a firm whose operations span the US and Asian markets, but the return an equity investor will demand should have nothing to do with the mix of the company's revenue sources, because markets in different countries are highly correlated.


**Concerns and Controversies:**

The company faces potential challenges from a decline in insurance pricing, a slowing economy, and pressure to maintain its organic growth, which has lagged relative to its peers, as noted in the Q4 2022 earnings call. Regulatory changes in the insurance sector could also pose challenges. MMC has faced increasing scrutiny over its ESG (environmental, social, and governance) practices as noted in MMC's 2023 10-K filing.

**Additional Comments:**

This valuation is a baseline, and should be updated with new information or different assumptions.  The wide range of potential outcomes, typical in DCF valuations, underscores the importance of constant monitoring and a margin of safety. 

>The valuation process relies on the market being imperfectly priced in some sense so that it is possible to buy something for less than what another person might think it worth, and to sell it at something more.
>There is no real safety or certainty in common-stock investing except for a truly unusually low price in relation to the value of its assets.  The lower the price, the less is the likelihood of a loss. The higher the price, the greater the possibility of loss.  
>It is difficult, if not impossible, to pick the one best stock or group of stocks unless the selection is based upon a wide investment program.   
>The investor should always remember that stocks are subject to wide fluctuations in their prices because of changes in the psychology of investors.

> A good investor has a solid philosophical foundation and an investment philosophy that are both aligned with his goals.

It's important to note that this valuation incorporates a more conservative and bearish view in line with Burry’s approach.
