## Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) | Moat: 3/5 | Understandability: 2/5 | Balance Sheet Health: N/A
A passively managed ETF that is a mirror of the Nasdaq 100 index.

{: .highlight } QQQ's returns are heavily dependent on the success of the top ten holdings, which have made up the majority of the fund's value since 2018. In fact, 10 holdings comprise about 50% of the entire ETF.

### Business Overview

QQQ is not a business in the traditional sense, but rather an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq-100 Index. The Nasdaq-100 includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and they are weighted by market capitalization. QQQ’s performance is therefore a direct reflection of the collective performance of these 100 companies. For that reason, analysis of QQQ involves understanding that the majority of its return is attributable to its top 10 holdings:
*   Apple
*   Microsoft
*   Amazon
*   Nvidia
*   Alphabet (Google) Class A
*   Alphabet (Google) Class C
*   Meta Platforms
*   Tesla
*   Broadcom
*   Costco

The Nasdaq-100's sector allocation is heavily skewed towards technology, with tech companies comprising the largest percentage of its holdings. These sectors can change a lot over time as different sectors gain and lose popularity.

#### Revenue Distribution

QQQ's performance is not measured on revenue but by the market value of its holdings. The revenue distribution of QQQ is basically the sum of the revenues of the various companies within it. Given its heavy weighting towards technology, revenues come from various tech businesses, which all have different business models:
-   Software and services (Microsoft, Adobe, etc.) 
-   E-commerce (Amazon, eBay)
-   Hardware and chip manufacturing (Apple, Nvidia, etc.) 
-   Advertising (Alphabet, Meta) 

The remainder of the ETF is made up of companies in other sectors, such as consumer discretionary, communication services, and healthcare. As a result, overall, the revenue streams of QQQ is very broad and comes from an array of different sectors.

#### Trends in the Industry

*   **Tech Dominance:**  The technology sector has shown consistent, long-term dominance in the market, with its revenue and influence growing year after year. A large majority of QQQ’s value rests on the performance of this sector.
*   **Innovation and Disruption:** Emerging technologies like AI, cloud computing, and electric vehicles are creating both opportunities and challenges for various industries. Some companies within QQQ are benefiting from these changes, while others struggle to adapt to a changed landscape.
*  **Market Volatility:** As has been observed in the past, markets have had a volatile ride from geopolitical and macroeconomic factors. QQQ's holdings tend to be volatile as well.

### Financials

As a passively managed ETF, QQQ does not have financials in the traditional sense, so we can't look at items like ROIC, earnings, revenue growth, etc. as we would with normal companies. Instead, we look at the overall performance of the ETF itself, which is derived from the stock price of all its underlying holdings. 

{: .note } A key distinction to keep in mind is that QQQ's return does not include dividends, and only reflects capital gains, which means that some popular dividend stocks within it are not a factor in the overall performance.

#### Moat Rating
{: .important } I give QQQ a moat rating of 3 out of 5.
While QQQ does not have a moat itself, it represents an investment in companies that may have a moat. The sustainability of this moat is dependent on the specific companies that make up the top 10 holdings of the Nasdaq 100 index and whether they can hold a competitive edge. I give it a '3' because although some stocks in QQQ may have durable competitive advantages, others don't. Due to the market cap weighting of QQQ, the companies with moats carry a much higher weightage and have a disproportionate effect on QQQ's success. The companies like Apple, Microsoft, and even Amex and Visa have proven their ability to maintain their moats. But others in QQQ, such as retailers, automakers, and hardware companies are likely to struggle to maintain them. While there are some truly impressive moats in some of QQQ's constituents, the ETF is far too diversified to be called anything more than a "3".

#### Risks to the Moat & Business Resilience

*   **Technological Disruption:** The rapid rate of technological change poses a risk to the companies within QQQ, especially those who rest on only one type of technology or brand, because they may face replacement by new inventions.
*   **Competition:** The competitive landscape is constantly changing and any company within QQQ that does not focus on continuous improvements and innovations is subject to losing its position, and its competitive edge.
*   **Macroeconomic Factors:** Market corrections, geopolitical uncertainties, and recessions pose threats to equity markets in general. Since QQQ is an index-following ETF, it would be affected by market trends and downturns like any other investment. However, its broad diversification may provide a degree of resilience against more targeted shocks.
*   **Cyclicality:** Some industries within QQQ, like chip manufacturing or oil, are sensitive to changes in the business cycle, which will make the stock prices less stable than more defensive industries.
*   **Oligopoly Risk:** The index has very high weightings towards certain tech stocks. If any of those stocks suffer a major downturn, QQQ could be negatively affected.

{: .warning }It is worth reiterating the fact that although stock prices may be influenced by earnings or valuations, the general market may at times become irrational and value stocks independent of their underlying business or fundamentals. This irrational behavior is very hard to predict or time.

#### Understandability Rating
 I give QQQ an understandability rating of 2 out of 5.
Because QQQ is a passively managed ETF, it is fairly simple in how it operates, and there's not much complexity in understanding it. It simply copies the Nasdaq 100 index. However, analyzing it is a lot more complex. QQQ’s value depends on companies spanning several industries each with their own business models, competition, and risks. Thus, to truly understand where QQQ’s returns come from and its future, requires a very detailed understanding of all the underlying companies which is incredibly complicated. Although QQQ is easy to understand, to evaluate the investment with a high degree of certainty requires a lot of effort, and therefore it gets a low "2".

#### Balance Sheet Health Rating

I cannot apply this rating to an ETF. The ETF is made up of other companies, which have their own balance sheet health and is not useful in evaluating QQQ. So rating here is not applicable and is rated as N/A.
