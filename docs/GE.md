{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5)**

GE's historical moat stemmed from a combination of factors:

* **Diversification:** GE operated in a wide range of businesses, giving it stability and some pricing power. 
* **Brand name:**  The GE brand carried weight, especially in consumer durables.
* **Technological innovation:** GE had a long history of research and development, leading to innovative products.
* **Size and scale:** GE's size gave it cost advantages and bargaining power with suppliers.

However, many of these advantages have eroded. Increased competition, technological disruption, and poor capital allocation decisions have weakened GE's competitive position. 

{: .warning }
>
> GE's diversification, once a strength, has become a source of complexity and inefficiency. The company has divested several businesses, including its financial services arm, and plans to split into three separate companies focused on aviation, healthcare, and energy. This suggests that the conglomerate structure may no longer be optimal, as pointed out in McKinsey's *Valuation* (Chapter 19) regarding corporate portfolio strategy.
>

While GE still possesses some technological differentiation, particularly in its aviation and healthcare segments, the barriers to entry in these industries are significant. Its renewable energy business faces intense competition and pricing pressure. Thus, GE's current moat is narrow and primarily resides in its aviation segment.

**Management (2/5)**

GE's management has been a source of disappointment for investors in recent years. While efforts have been made to improve performance and communication, a history of poor capital allocation decisions, earnings manipulation, and a lack of transparency weigh heavily on the rating.

* **History:**  GE’s performance has lagged the market over the past decade, marred by accounting scandals, ill-timed acquisitions, and massive write-downs. As Graham emphasizes in *The Intelligent Investor* (Chapter 10), past performance is not a guarantee of future success, but a poor track record can be a warning sign. 
* **Experience:** While current CEO Larry Culp has extensive experience in industrial businesses, his tenure at GE has been mixed. The planned breakup of the company could be viewed as an admission of past management failures, resembling the “corporate portfolio restructuring” discussed in McKinsey's *Valuation* (Chapter 19), often triggered by lagging performance.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation at GE has historically been high, even during periods of poor performance. 
* **Insider ownership:**  Insider ownership at GE is relatively low, potentially reducing management's incentive to act in the best interests of shareholders.
* **Communication:** GE has taken steps to improve investor communication, but more transparency is needed, particularly regarding its long-term strategy and financial projections, as highlighted by the discussion on intrinsic investors in McKinsey's *Valuation* (Chapter 24).
* **Capital allocation:** GE's capital allocation decisions have been questionable, with several value-destroying acquisitions. As Damodaran emphasizes in *The Little Book of Valuation* (Chapter 20), even the best company in the world can be a bad investment if you overpay for it.

> As Culp stated in the Q2 2023 earnings call: "We are acutely aware of how challenging the operating environment has been. And we are not making any excuses on that front." This acknowledgment of challenges, coupled with the planned spin-offs, signals that management is acutely focused on addressing the operational and financial issues confronting GE. 
>

**Catalyst (3/5)**

The planned breakup of GE into three separate companies presents a significant catalyst for potential share price appreciation.

* **Focus:**  Focusing on aviation, healthcare, and energy could unlock value by allowing each business to pursue its own strategy and capital allocation priorities, as suggested by the concept of corporate portfolio strategy discussed in McKinsey's *Valuation* (Chapter 19).
* **Efficiency:** Separating the businesses could lead to greater efficiency and cost savings, improving profitability and potentially increasing returns on invested capital.
* **Market perception:**  The breakup could also lead to a more positive market perception of GE, as investors may be more willing to value the individual businesses at higher multiples.

However, execution risk remains, and there is no guarantee that the breakup will be successful in creating value.

**Valuation ($127.2 Billion)**

We used a sum-of-the-parts valuation, based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis of each of GE's three core businesses, to arrive at a fair value of $127.2 billion.


**Business Overview**

* **Aviation:** GE Aviation is a leading provider of aircraft engines, systems, and services. It is the company's most profitable segment, benefiting from the long lead times in developing and building aircraft. The competitive landscape includes Pratt & Whitney (RTX) and Rolls-Royce (RR.).
{: .note }
>
> GE Aviation is facing headwinds from supply chain challenges, particularly in the sourcing of parts for its LEAP engine, as mentioned in its Q3 2023 earnings call. However, as CEO Larry Culp noted, "We have seen some modest sequential improvement in our shop visits on the LEAP, and we're also seeing some improvement in overall engine availability as well."
>
* **Healthcare:** GE Healthcare provides medical imaging, diagnostic, patient monitoring, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing technologies. It faces competition from Siemens Healthineers (SHL) and Philips (PHIA).  
* **Power:**  GE Power provides equipment, solutions, and services across the energy value chain.  It is facing significant headwinds from the transition to renewable energy sources and declining demand for traditional power generation equipment. It competes with Siemens Energy (ENR) and Mitsubishi Power (MHVYF).

**Financials**

* **Revenue:**  GE's revenues have declined in recent years, reflecting the divestitures and challenges in its power segment.
* **Margins:** Margins have also been under pressure.
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**  ROIC has been declining, reflecting the challenges in GE's businesses. 
* **Cash flow:** GE’s cash flow from operations has been generally positive.
* **Debt:** GE carries a significant debt burden, adding another element of risk.


**Detailed Valuation Calculations**

We employed a DCF approach to value each segment separately.

**Aviation:**
* Revenue growth (years 1-5): 8%
* Operating Margin (year 5): 25%
* Reinvestment Rate: 40%
* Cost of Capital: 11.27%
* Terminal Growth Rate: 3%
* Terminal ROIC: 20%
* Value: $81.3 billion

**Healthcare:**
* Revenue growth (years 1-5): 4%
* Operating Margin (year 5): 20%
* Reinvestment Rate: 30%
* Cost of Capital: 9.85%
* Terminal Growth Rate: 3%
* Terminal ROIC: 15%
* Value: $28.7 billion

**Power:**
* Revenue growth (years 1-5): 2%
* Operating Margin (year 5): 10%
* Reinvestment Rate: 20%
* Cost of Capital: 7.74%
* Terminal Growth Rate: 3%
* Terminal ROIC: 10%
* Value: $17.2 billion

Summing the values of the three segments gives a total enterprise value of $127.2 billion.

> These assumptions are pessimistic and are based on a thorough analysis of GE's financials and the competitive landscapes of its core businesses. The actual value could be significantly different but given the challenges and uncertainties surrounding the breakup, the relatively low management rating, and the high debt levels, we have taken a conservative approach.

**Conclusion**

GE is a company in transition. While it is a much weaker company than it was in its heyday, the planned breakup presents a potential catalyst for value creation. However, given the execution risks and the company's recent history, investors should proceed with caution.  The current market price may overstate GE’s intrinsic value, based on our conservative estimates.
