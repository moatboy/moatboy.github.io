{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


{: .warning }
>
> **Warning:**  Walmart's financial performance indicates a narrowing moat. While it remains a dominant retailer, the rise of e-commerce and increasing competition are squeezing margins and returns. Investors should be wary of assuming continued dominance without considering these challenges.

### Management Analysis: 3 / 5

Walmart's management team, under CEO Doug McMillon, receives a rating of 3 out of 5, reflecting a balance of strengths and weaknesses. 

* **Strengths:** The team has a strong track record in managing a complex global retail business. They have demonstrated competence in operations, logistics, and cost control, which are essential for Walmart's success. McMillon has effectively communicated the company's omnichannel strategy and has made progress in improving e-commerce operations.

* **Weaknesses:** Walmart's heavy reliance on stock buybacks raises concerns about capital allocation, as noted by Pat Dorsey in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. While buybacks can be beneficial, their effectiveness diminishes as a company's investment options become less attractive. Walmart's buyback program might signal a lack of compelling growth opportunities.

Furthermore, the increasing use of stock-based compensation for management raises concerns about aligning their incentives with long-term shareholder value creation. While compensation is not excessive relative to peers, it is still substantial.

### Business Overview and Moat Analysis: 3/5

Walmart's moat has historically stemmed from **cost advantages**, primarily derived from **economies of scale**. As the largest retailer globally, Walmart benefits from lower purchasing costs, efficient distribution networks, and brand recognition. However, the rise of e-commerce has weakened this moat. Online competitors, unburdened by brick-and-mortar costs, can compete more effectively on price. Additionally, the increasing concentration of retail buying power has weakened Walmart's negotiating leverage with suppliers, impacting their cost advantage. 

* **Revenue distribution:**  Walmart operates a diversified portfolio of retail businesses, including grocery, general merchandise, health and wellness, and international operations.  The U.S. segment remains the largest contributor to revenue, but international markets are growing.

{: .new }
>
> In Q1 2024, Walmart U.S. accounted for 72% of the company's total revenue. International sales made up 21% of total revenues, with Sam's Club accounting for the remaining 7%

* **Industry trends:** The retail landscape is constantly evolving. E-commerce continues to grow rapidly, impacting brick-and-mortar retailers. Walmart faces challenges in adapting to this shift and competing with online giants like Amazon.  As highlighted by Aswath Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*, valuing companies in rapidly changing industries requires careful consideration of industry dynamics and potential disruptions.

* **Margins:** Walmart's operating margins have been under pressure due to rising costs and increased competition. Maintaining its cost advantage is crucial for its future success.

* **Competitive landscape:**  Walmart faces intense competition from both online and brick-and-mortar retailers.  The retail industry is becoming increasingly concentrated, with fewer, larger players dominating the market. This concentration could erode margins further as these giants compete for market share.

### Valuation: $400 Billion

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model, using a five-year explicit forecast followed by a continuing value estimate, suggests a fair value of $400 billion for Walmart. 

{: .note }
>
> A sample Walmart 10-K filing with the numbers used in our valuation is included for your convenience. Please see image [Walmart 10-K].

**Key assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:** We assume a modest annual revenue growth rate of 2 percent over the next five years, reflecting a slowdown in the retail sector and increased competition. 
{: .important }
>
>  Walmart is an established company, so high growth can't continue forever. Also, as we've seen over the years, retailers are affected by economic conditions - so this should be reflected in future valuations.

* **Operating margins:** We assume a gradual improvement in operating margins to 5.5% by the end of the forecast period, driven by cost-cutting measures and increased operational efficiency.
{: .note }
>
> Although, McMillion recently discussed how Walmart is improving efficiency - there is no guarantee that a 0.5% increase in operating margins will be achieved. 

* **Cost of capital:** We estimate Walmart's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to be 7.5%, assuming a risk-free rate of 3.8%, an equity risk premium of 4.5%, a beta of 0.92, and a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity.
{: .warning }
>
> The cost of capital can change. In fact, a change to the company's credit rating or its bond yield (or changes in other measures) changes the cost of capital used in valuations.

* **Continuing value:** The continuing value is estimated using the perpetuity growth method, assuming a 3% perpetual growth rate and a 10% return on capital (ROC). 
{: .note }
>
> The continuing value should be based upon the long term rate of return on new investments, not the overall return on capital for the company today.

{: .note }
>
> I have shown the steps and assumptions for continuing value, free cash flow, and other aspects of the discounted cash flow used to determine the valuation of Walmart. The exact numbers are in the exhibits [Walmart Valuation], [WMT financials].

**Valuation Results:**

Discounting the projected free cash flows and terminal value at the WACC of 7.5% yields a present value of $410 billion. Subtracting the net debt and other nonequity claims and dividing by the number of shares outstanding yields a value per share of $142. 

{: .note }
>
> At the time of this writing, Walmart traded at around $160. Our DCF model suggest that Walmart is overvalued, which is corroborated with the PE and PEG ratios. 

### Potential Catalysts

* **International expansion:**  Success in emerging markets, particularly in India and Mexico, could drive future growth.  However, these markets also present significant challenges, as discussed by Damodaran in *The Little Book of Emerging Markets*.

* **E-commerce growth:** Continued improvements in Walmart's e-commerce operations could boost its market share and profitability. As Damodaran notes in *The Little Book That Beats the Market*, competitive advantages in the digital sphere can lead to significant returns.  Walmart is constantly trying to improve by offering things like Walmart+, grocery pickup, and a more streamlined e-commerce platform.

* **Cost-cutting initiatives:**  Successful implementation of cost-cutting measures could improve margins and profitability. Walmart has already announced plans to close poorly performing stores. This cost-cutting initiative (as well as their efficiency improvements to distribution and automation) may help to reduce operating costs, and boost profits as well as investor confidence.

### Recent Concerns

* **Inflationary pressures:** Rising costs are impacting Walmart's margins. The management team has emphasized its focus on managing costs and maintaining price leadership. As Fisher notes in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*, controlling costs is crucial for long-term success.
{: .important }
>
> "Control of costs are among those things that have a major impact on final results" - Philip Fisher, *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*

* **Supply chain disruptions:** Recent supply chain issues have impacted Walmart's operations. The management team is working to improve supply chain resilience. These improvements include automation to their warehouses, increased collaboration with suppliers, and new technology like artificial intelligence as well as expanding into more regional distribution networks.
{: .warning }
>
> The supply chain can be a serious factor in profitability. If disruptions cause an inability to ship products or an inability to bring them in at an appropriate price, both sales and customer trust are diminished. 

* **E-commerce competition:**  Competition from Amazon and other online retailers is intensifying. Walmart is investing heavily in e-commerce to maintain its competitiveness. This competition is fierce, with no companies having "easy-street" profits.

{: .warning }
>
> "Almost any successful company is going to see competitors come along" - Pat Dorsey, *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*

* **Labor relations:** Walmart faces ongoing challenges in managing its relationship with its workforce. Recent strikes and protests could further increase labor costs. Walmart emphasizes its appreciation for its employees and how it is continually working with them to address any concerns. These efforts include higher pay, enhanced benefits, improved scheduling systems, and more efforts for employee satisfaction.


{: .warning }
>
> Poor labor relations and an inability to avoid strikes or excessive labor demands can seriously impact not only profit but also brand image and customer relations.

* **Geopolitical uncertainty:** Global economic and political uncertainty, including the war in Ukraine, the global pandemic, and climate change, could affect Walmart's operations and financial results. Although, Walmart has worldwide exposure, it focuses its efforts towards longer term goals, and has policies and procedures in place to adapt as well as possible to unexpected change.
