Pessimistic value: $225 billion

Cigna, a global health service company, operates in a complex and competitive industry.  While it benefits from some scale advantages and brand recognition, its moat is relatively narrow, justifying a rating of 2 out of 5. The company's management, while seemingly competent, hasn't demonstrated exceptional capital allocation skills, leading to a rating of 3 out of 5.  The company has a moderate catalyst rating of 2 out of 5, based on potential growth in emerging markets and the expansion of its Evernorth segment.  Our pessimistic valuation, based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, suggests a fair value of approximately $225 billion.

>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5)**

Cigna's narrow moat stems primarily from two sources:

* **Scale Advantages:** As one of the largest health service providers globally, Cigna benefits from economies of scale in areas like claims processing, provider networks, and data analytics. These advantages, however, are not insurmountable.  Smaller competitors can and do exist, and the industry overall has seen substantial consolidation, which has increased bargaining power on the supply side (pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers) and on the customer side (large corporations and government entities), potentially squeezing margins over time.  As discussed in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, scale advantages are most powerful at a local or regional level, not at the national level, making it more challenging for Cigna to leverage its global presence into a sustainable cost advantage.
* **Brand Recognition:**  Cigna's brand is well-known and generally trusted, providing some customer captivity. However, as *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* points out, brand recognition alone doesn't guarantee pricing power. This is especially true in the health services industry, where purchasing decisions are heavily influenced by employers and healthcare providers, and brand loyalty plays a limited role relative to price and perceived quality.

{: .warning }

Cigna lacks the powerful network effects seen in industries like software or credit cards.  Its switching costs are also relatively low, as employers can change insurers, and individuals typically have few choices within their employer's plan.

**Management Analysis (3/5)**

Cigna's management appears competent, but not exceptional, earning a rating of 3 out of 5:

* **History/Experience:** The management team has a long history in the health services sector.  David Cordani, Cigna's CEO, has been with the company since 2008, providing steady leadership.  However, long tenure doesn't necessarily equate to excellence. 
* **Capital Allocation:** Cigna has not demonstrated outstanding capital allocation skills. While the acquisition of Express Scripts expanded its pharmacy benefit management business, it remains to be seen whether the value created will exceed the price paid. The company's share repurchases have been significant but haven't always been timed optimally.
* **Communication:**  Cigna's investor relations materials provide some segment-level data, but often lack the detail required for a thorough analysis. This makes it more difficult for investors to fully understand the business and assess its long-term prospects, a problem Aswath Damodaran highlights in *The Little Book of Valuation*. The management team also frequently uses adjusted earnings figures, which can obscure the company's underlying economic performance. 
* **Compensation/Insider Ownership:** Executive compensation appears to be largely in line with peers. Insider ownership is significant, aligning management's interests with those of shareholders to some extent, but not enough to justify a higher rating given the company's inconsistent capital allocation history.

{: .important }

A key concern is the company's debt level, which has risen since the Express Scripts acquisition. As discussed in *Valuation*, high debt levels can limit flexibility and increase financial risk, particularly in a cyclical industry.

**Business Analysis**

* **Revenues:**  Cigna's revenues are generated primarily from two segments: Evernorth (pharmacy benefit management, specialty pharmacy, and other health services) and Cigna Healthcare (health insurance for individuals, employers, government entities, etc.). Evernorth accounts for a larger share of revenue and is growing more quickly than the more mature Cigna Healthcare.
* **Industry Trends:** The health services industry is highly regulated and evolving rapidly. The rise of digital technologies, the shift to value-based care, and increasing consolidation are reshaping the competitive landscape.
* **Margins:**  Cigna’s margins have shown some volatility recently, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and consolidation of its businesses. As Michael Mauboussin notes in his commentary in *Measuring the Moat*, "The more money a company makes, the more likely it is to face new competition."
* **Competitive Landscape:** The healthcare industry is highly competitive, with large players like UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health, Anthem, and others. Cigna attempts to differentiate itself by focusing on integrated health services, combining medical, pharmacy, and behavioral health offerings. 

**Financial Analysis**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Cigna has seen strong revenue growth in recent years, largely driven by the Express Scripts acquisition. Organic growth, however, has been more modest. As Damodaran notes, fast-growing companies often fail to live up to expectations and warns against overly optimistic revenue growth projections.  
* **Profitability:** Cigna's ROIC has been gradually declining since 2008 as competition has intensified and the sector has consolidated. 

{: .note }

Cigna's high debt level following the Express Scripts acquisition is a concern. While interest coverage ratios remain within investment-grade parameters, the ability of the company to sustain growth while deleveraging is a key challenge.

**Valuation ($225 billion)**

A two-stage discounted cash flow analysis was performed using annual data from 2019 to 2022, assuming a constant growth rate of 2.0% in perpetuity. To calculate free cash flows, net income was adjusted for depreciation and amortization, working capital adjustments and other non-cash expenses.  A weighted-average cost of capital of 7.56% was estimated based on target debt and equity ratios.

**Key assumptions:**

* **Growth rate:** 2% terminal growth in line with real GDP growth.
* **Operating margin:** 15%
* **Reinvestment rate:** 10%

>**Calculation:**
>Year 1 free cash flow: $8.8 billion (estimated)
>Terminal value =  FCF<sub>n</sub> * (1+g) / (WACC-g)
>Terminal value (in year 10) = $63.8 billion


{: .new }

Discounting the free cash flows and the terminal value gives us a total enterprise value of approximately $250 billion.
Subtracting net debt (total debt including operating lease and pension liabilities less excess cash), which is estimated at about $25 billion (given in company filings) from this figure, yields an equity value of $225 billion.


**Catalysts (2/5)**

* **Emerging Markets:** Cigna is expanding into emerging markets, where it sees significant growth potential. Success in these markets could drive long-term revenue growth, although these markets are also likely to be more volatile and risky.  Cordani commented on this in the Q3 2020 earnings call, saying that “International is well positioned to capitalize on the fundamental growth trends that we see, and we're continuing to invest and expand in these markets.”
* **Evernorth:** Cigna's Evernorth segment is rapidly expanding and includes a broad range of health services businesses. Successful expansion and integration of these businesses could improve margins and create operating efficiencies, although competitive intensity is likely to increase. In the Q4 2022 earnings call, Cordani highlighted Evernorth's potential, saying, “We continue to see very strong performance in Evernorth, driven by the strength of our solutions, which are increasingly relevant in today's environment.”

{: .note }

While these catalysts offer some upside potential, Cigna faces headwinds from increasing competition, evolving regulations, and its substantial debt load. These risks make a higher catalyst rating difficult to justify.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies**

Cigna has faced several concerns recently, including lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny regarding its pharmacy benefit management practices.  These challenges were discussed in recent earnings calls but didn't seem to materially alter the company's long-term outlook, according to management.  However, these ongoing issues reinforce the importance of a close eye on the company's future performance and a degree of skepticism about management's projections.


This analysis is based on the provided resources and currently available information and represents a pessimistic view, given the inherent uncertainties of the stock market and the company’s industry. This valuation is an approximation and is highly sensitive to the assumptions used.  Further research and monitoring of the company's performance are necessary to validate the thesis and to maintain a margin of safety, a critical concept for value investors, as emphasized by Benjamin Graham in *The Intelligent Investor*.
