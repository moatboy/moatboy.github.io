{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Deckers benefits primarily from its brand name, specifically for the UGG brand.  This provides some pricing power, though less so than iconic brands like Coca-Cola. As highlighted by Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*, brand names are valuable to the extent that they confer pricing power. UGG has achieved strong brand recognition, but its fashion-driven nature makes it vulnerable to changing consumer tastes. This limits the strength and durability of its moat. HOKA is also gaining traction and building brand power, but it still needs to demonstrate long-term sustained performance to justify a strong moat rating.

{: .warning }

As competition in the footwear and apparel industry is intense, a brand-based moat is not as robust as other types of moats, like switching costs or network effects. The company's Sanuk and Teva brands do not appear to possess significant pricing power.

**Management (3/5):**

Management's focus on the HOKA brand and its growth has been successful, and the recent CEO transition could be viewed positively, given the new CEO's experience and long tenure at the company. Capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases, have been reasonable. However, prior acquisitions have not been consistently successful. Compensation appears in line with industry peers.

As emphasized in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth* by Pat Dorsey, management quality is secondary to business quality. While management's actions can affect a company's value,  it is the inherent strength and resilience of the business that matters most.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

The ongoing growth of HOKA provides a potential catalyst, as does continued international expansion.  However, dependence on fashion trends and competitive pressures in the athletic footwear industry limit the strength of these catalysts. The lack of diversification within the company's portfolio further dampens the catalyst rating.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** DECK derives revenue from wholesale (to retailers), direct-to-consumer (DTC, including retail stores and e-commerce), and distributor channels. While wholesale remains a significant portion of the business, DTC is growing rapidly, fueled by e-commerce expansion and new store openings. HOKA sales represent the largest share of total revenue for the company.
* **Industry Trends:** The athletic footwear industry is experiencing slow growth overall, with increased competition and a shift toward online sales.  Consolidation in the industry, driven by acquisitions and mergers, continues.  Fashion trends heavily influence consumer demand.
* **Margins:** DECK enjoys relatively high gross margins thanks to its brand name pricing power. Operating margins, however, are under pressure due to marketing and administrative expenses, including significant investments in HOKA's growth. 
* **Competitive Landscape:** The industry is highly competitive, with global giants like Nike and Adidas leading the way.  DECK differentiates itself through specialized brands targeting specific niches (e.g., HOKA for performance running).

**Financial Analysis:**

A detailed financial analysis reveals the following key takeaways:

* **Revenue Growth:**  DECK has delivered strong revenue growth, largely driven by HOKA, though this growth is expected to moderate.
* **Profitability:** While gross margins are healthy, operating margins are under pressure due to HOKA growth investments.  
* **Capital Structure:** The company has a modest amount of debt. 
* **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**  HOKA's ROIC exceeds the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) indicating value creation, though not as exceptionally high as some other companies in the consumer discretionary sector.


**Valuation ($11.5 billion):**


I performed an enterprise discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, using financials from DECK's 10-K reports.  I used a five-year explicit forecast period, assuming a gradual decrease in revenue growth from the present high levels to a stable long-term growth of 3%, and a stable operating margin of 15%. After year 5, I calculate continuing value assuming 3% terminal growth and a stable ROIC of 12% in perpetuity.  For discounting, I use a WACC of 8.5% based on its latest quarterly report data. To estimate the cost of equity, I use CAPM with a beta of 1.35, a risk free rate of 4.0% and a market risk premium of 4.5%. For calculating WACC, I assume a target capital structure of 25% debt. Key assumptions are consistent with DECK's reported targets, analyst estimates, and a conservative outlook.

1.  **NOPLAT:** Start with EBIT, add back restructuring charges and non-operating charges such as the amortization of acquired intangibles (goodwill is not included in this amortization). Then subtract taxes.
2.  **Invested Capital:** Start with total invested capital (TIC) from the balance sheet. Then, strip out non-operating assets: Add to TIC any investments in other companies and marketable securities. Subtract cash balances.
3.  **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** From NOPLAT subtract investments in working capital (the annual change) and net capital expenditures, which equals total capital expenditures minus depreciation.
4.  **Continuing Value:** Use the FCF formula in perpetuity.
5.  **Discount and Sum:** Discount the FCFs for years 1 to 5 plus the continuing value by 8.5% to get today's present value of the operations.
6.  **Value of Non-operating Assets:** Add back cash, minority interest, and other non-operating assets (from recent 10-K).
7.  **Value of Equity:** Subtract the value of debt from the value of the assets.
8.  **Value per Share:**  Divide equity value by the number of shares outstanding.

**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

The recent CEO transition caused some uncertainty, though the new CEO has a long history at the company.  Supply chain disruptions and the highly promotional retail environment have also been headwinds, putting pressure on margins. As noted in the Q1 2024 Earnings Call, management highlighted the promotional environment impacting retail.

**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Continued HOKA Growth:**  HOKA has consistently exceeded expectations. Further market share gains can drive the stock price higher.
* **Successful Integration of Acquired Brands:**  Prior acquisitions have not always delivered value. Successful integration of recent acquisitions and the realization of synergies can improve profitability.
* **Rebound in UGG brand:** although UGG sales are in decline, they represent a large portion of DECK's revenue. Any sign of a rebound could boost investor sentiment.
* **International Expansion:**  Continued penetration into international markets, particularly in Asia, represents a significant growth opportunity.
* **Improved E-commerce Performance:** Growing online sales can contribute to improved profitability, given higher margins in the DTC channel.

{: .highlight }

Based on the above analysis, a reasonable estimate of DECKâ€™s value is around $11.5 billion, with room for upside. However, a conservative outlook warrants caution given the high valuation multiples in the sector and the importance of fashion trends, particularly for the company's flagship UGG brand.
