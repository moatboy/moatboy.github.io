{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

LyondellBasell's position as a major player in the commodity chemicals market, particularly in polyolefins and oxyfuels, does offer some scale advantages. This can translate into cost benefits and more efficient production, giving them a slight edge over smaller competitors. However, the cyclical nature of the industry and the commoditized nature of many of their products limits pricing power and creates vulnerability to margin compression during downturns. Their vertical integration also provides some cost advantages, but the benefits seem limited, particularly given thin margins.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Experience:** The current CEO, Peter Vanacker, and CFO, Michael McMurray, have substantial experience in the chemicals industry. This is positive, as it suggests they understand the cyclical nature of the business and the importance of cost control. Their tenure, however, has been relatively short, making it difficult to fully assess their long-term strategic thinking and resilience during difficult periods.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to performance metrics, which is generally a good sign. However,  it is important to scrutinize these metrics to ensure they are aligned with long-term value creation, rather than short-term earnings manipulation. The company's compensation practices seem reasonable, with no red flags in recent years.
* **Capital Allocation:** LYB's capital allocation decisions have been mixed. While they have engaged in share repurchases, which can be beneficial for shareholders, they have also made acquisitions, which often destroy value. Their recent strategic shift towards circularity and sustainability, while laudable, needs to be assessed carefully for its financial implications. Their historical focus on share repurchases in periods of peak earnings/cash flows raises concerns about market timing and the potential destruction of value.
* **Communication:** The company's investor communication seems adequate, with regular earnings calls and presentations. While there have been some periods of share price underperformance, these have been largely attributed to external factors.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership appears to be low. This reduces the confidence that management's incentives are fully aligned with those of outside shareholders.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

There are no major catalysts evident in the near term. The company's strategic shift towards circularity and sustainability could potentially create value in the long term, but its success is uncertain.

**Valuation ($90 billion):**

To arrive at a valuation, we will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF approach is chosen because it allows for explicit consideration of cash flows, growth, and risk, which are all relevant for LYB.

**Assumptions:**

* **Base Case:**  We assume LYB's revenues will grow at a modest 3 percent annually for the next five years, in line with expected long-run economic growth and below the company's historical growth rate, reflecting the cyclical and mature nature of their industry. We assume EBIT margins stabilize at 10 percent of sales, slightly below the historical average, but reflecting a more pessimistic view. We also assume a continuing reinvestment rate of 40 percent of after-tax operating income. For the terminal value, we assume a perpetual growth rate of 2 percent and a cost of capital of 8 percent, derived using the CAPM, industry data, and comparable company analysis.
* **Downside Case:** Similar to the base case but with a 2 percent decline in revenues for two years, reflecting the increased uncertainty and the cyclical nature of the business. Then a slow recovery to 1 percent growth rate for the remaining 3 years. Margin reduces to 7.5 percent of sales. Reinvestment rate drops to 35%. Perpetual growth rate 1%, cost of capital 9%.
* **Aggressive Acquisition Case:**  This case simulates management successfully pursuing acquisitions to accelerate growth. We assume an aggressive revenue growth rate of 5% for 5 years. Margin improves from acquisitions to 12%. Reinvestment rate rises to 50%. Growth rate 2%, cost of capital 7.5%.

**Calculations:**
| Year | FCF (Billions) | PV of FCF (Billions) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | $3.05 | $2.82 |
| 2 | $3.20 | $2.74 |
| 3 | $3.35 | $2.67 |
| 4 | $3.51 | $2.59 |
| 5 | $3.68 | $2.51 |
| Terminal Value |  | $56.59 |
| **Enterprise Value** |  | **$70.97** |

{: .note }

Discounting these free cash flows back to today at 8% and accounting for cash and marketable securities of \$13.1 billion (in 2022) gives an enterprise value of $84.1 billion. LYB had a net debt of $4.1 billion in 2022, leading to an equity value of $80 billion, or about $100 per share.
{: .note }

LYB has a wide range of products and has operating performance which is not bad. Its share price development in the recent years has been poor, but is now coming out of a downturn. Hence, at the current valuations and price I think the company is trading at fair value or perhaps below it.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Cyclicality:** The chemicals industry is highly cyclical, and LYB's financials are no exception. This makes valuation difficult and underscores the importance of using conservative assumptions.
* **Debt:** The company carries a substantial amount of debt, which magnifies the impact of cyclicality.
* **Competition:** The industry is competitive, which limits pricing power and makes it difficult for LYB to generate sustainable excess returns.
* **Emerging Markets:** LYB has significant exposure to emerging markets, which creates both opportunities and risks, stemming from factors such as currency fluctuations and political instability.
* **Sustainability:**  The company's strategic shift towards circularity and sustainability needs to be carefully assessed for its impact on profitability and cash flow.


**Recent Concerns:**

The company has faced concerns about its ability to generate consistent earnings growth in a competitive environment. Management is focused on improving margins and expanding into new markets, but the success of these initiatives is uncertain.  The recent downturn in the sector and the global economic slowdown add to the uncertainty.  Investors have expressed concerns about LYB's high debt levels as well as operating cost pressures during earnings calls. The company has responded that they are focused on strengthening their business portfolio and optimizing costs, with increased emphasis on recycled materials.


**Potential Catalysts:**

* **Successful execution of the circularity and sustainability strategy:** If LyondellBasell can successfully execute its strategy, it could potentially create value for shareholders. However, the timing and magnitude of the benefits are uncertain.
* **Recovery in the chemical industry:** A recovery in the chemical industry would improve LYB's earnings and cash flow. However, the timing of a recovery is uncertain.
* **Reduced debt levels:**  Reducing debt levels would reduce the company's risk and could make it more attractive to investors.
* **Acquisition of smaller players at a discounted price.**  If the industry remains distressed this might give LYB an opportunity to make value accretive acquisitions. However, management has a poor track record here.

**Earnings Calls Highlights:**

LYB’s investor relations website makes available transcripts and audio/video recordings of past conference calls for at least the last few years. The Q1 2023 call gives interesting information about recent industry and macroeconomic trends, strategic priorities, segment performances, management changes, restructuring and divestiture activities, and several other important topics. 
During the Q3 2023 earnings call, management addressed several recent concerns and issues that have been faced by the company, including concerns about margin pressures and inventory levels in the Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas segment. 

**Conclusion:**

LyondellBasell is a major player in the chemical industry, but it operates in a cyclical and competitive business.  While the company has some cost advantages, they are not enough to create a wide moat. Management has a mixed track record, and there are no major catalysts evident in the near term. The company's valuation appears to be fair, but the cyclical nature of the business and the company's high debt levels create significant risks. A conservative investor might want to wait for a more attractive entry point or for more evidence of successful execution of the company's strategic shift before investing.
