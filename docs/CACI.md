## Moat Rating: 3/5

CACI has a moderate economic moat. Its consistent work with government agencies for long periods of time indicates the presence of some stickiness in its customer relations, but the competitive environment in federal contracting is fierce.

*   **Intangible Assets**: CACI's long standing relationships with Government agencies, it has over 60 years experience, along with its name recognition and reputation helps in generating business, but this moat is dependent on the company's ability to maintain its position.
*   **Switching Costs:** CACI benefits from moderate customer switching costs, as long term relationships with contracts generate high switching costs. However, the need for agencies to switch will depend heavily on price points which are always in competition.
*   **Network Effects:** There are no significant network effects for CACI.
*  **Cost advantages:** CACI does not have any inherent structural cost advantages other than through increased scale, which are limited.

## Understandability Rating: 3 / 5

While CACI's business model is fairly straightforward, some nuances make understanding complex.

*   CACI's business model consists of winning government contracts, and the performance of these contracts is often not very well documented or laid out, making it difficult for an investor to make a good estimation of their future performance.
*   The company's contracts and bidding strategies are pretty complicated, and can be confusing at first sight. The industry is very competitive, and it can be difficult to understand how CACI is better than other competitors.
*   CACI generates cash based on these contracts and other services provided, and for an investor to correctly value a business, one must correctly understand the underlying drivers.

## Balance Sheet Health: 4 / 5

CACI has a fairly healthy balance sheet, with a decent liquidity and manageable debt. However, one should be cautious of a rapid increase in debt.

*  CACI's cash flows have remained healthy over the past year and with a low level of short-term debt it will likely maintain this balance sheet position.
* The debt levels are within acceptable margins, however, increasing costs and expenses could lead to a worse liquidity.
* Although CACI has lots of intangible assets, it also has a significant amount of real assets.
