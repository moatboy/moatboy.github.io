{: .warning } 
>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.
* **Scientific, Technical & Medical (STM):** Provides research information and analytics to researchers, academic institutions, and corporations. This segment benefits from network effects and high switching costs.
* **Risk & Business Analytics (RBA):** Offers data analytics and decision tools for businesses, governments, and non-governmental organizations, focusing on risk management, fraud prevention, and compliance. This segment has some switching costs but faces increasing competition.
* **Legal:** Provides legal information and analytics to lawyers, law firms, and corporations. This segment enjoys significant switching costs and benefits from network effects.
* **Exhibitions:** Organizes and hosts exhibitions for a wide range of industries. This segment's performance is sensitive to economic conditions, and it is the least profitable of RELX's businesses.


### Business Analysis

**Revenues Distribution (2022):**

* STM: 34%
* Risk & Business Analytics: 38%
* Legal: 20%
* Exhibitions: 8%

**Industry Trends:**

* **STM:**  Shifting towards open access publishing, increasing competition.
* **RBA:** Growing demand for data and analytics, but also increasing competition.
* **Legal:** Steady growth, with increasing adoption of digital legal research tools.
* **Exhibitions:** Recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, but sensitive to economic conditions.

**Margins (2022):**

* Adjusted operating profit margin: 30.1%

**Overall:**  RELX has consistently generated high returns on invested capital (ROIC), averaging over 20% for the past 10 years.  The company has a modest level of debt and a substantial amount of cash.


### Moat Analysis

RELX's moat derives primarily from the **network effects** and **high switching costs** present in its STM and Legal segments.  

* **Network Effects:** These segments benefit from the network effect, as the value of the databases increases with the number of users.  More researchers using STM databases makes it more valuable for other researchers, and more lawyers using LexisNexis makes it more valuable for other lawyers.

* **Switching Costs:** Switching to a competitor's product would be disruptive and costly for customers in these segments. Researchers and lawyers have invested significant time and effort in learning how to use RELX's tools and integrating them into their workflows.

However, some factors weaken RELX's moat:

* **Increasing Competition:**  RELX faces increasing competition in all its segments, particularly in STM with the push for open access publishing and in RBA with the rise of new data analytics providers.

* **Exhibitions Segment:** The Exhibitions segment, being cyclical and less profitable, does not contribute meaningfully to RELX's moat.


<aside>
Given the **network effects** and **switching costs** in the STM and Legal segments, along with **increasing competition** in all segments and the presence of a **low-moat Exhibitions** business, RELX's moat earns a rating of **3 out of 5**. I am choosing to be conservative and rate it a 3 rather than a 4.

### Valuation

We will perform a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of RELX, using its free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).  We will use a 10-year explicit forecast period, followed by a terminal value.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% average annual growth over the next 10 years (pessimistic, given increasing competition and maturity of core markets).
* **Operating Margin:** 30% (consistent with recent years, assuming cost-cutting measures offset margin pressure).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 10% (lower than recent years, reflecting reduced growth expectations).
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 8% (based on a risk-free rate of 4%, an equity risk premium of 4%, a beta of 1, a cost of debt of 4%, and a target capital structure of 15% debt and 85% equity).


**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCFF) Forecast:**  Project revenue and operating margin to arrive at operating income. Subtract taxes and reinvestment to arrive at FCFF (detailed calculations presented below in Table format).

2. **Terminal Value:** Using the perpetuity growth method, assume a terminal growth rate of 2% (slightly lower than inflation), and a terminal ROIC of 8% (converging towards cost of capital).


* **Terminal value:** = (FCFF<sub>11</sub> \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)


3. **Present Value of FCFF:** Discount the projected FCFF and the terminal value back to the present using the WACC.

4. **Enterprise Value:** Sum the present values of FCFF and terminal value.

5. **Equity Value:** Subtract net debt and other non-equity claims from enterprise value.

6. **Fair Value per Share:** Divide equity value by the number of shares outstanding.


**Table: RELX Valuation (in $ Millions)**

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | Reinvestment | FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $27,343 | 30% | $8,203 | $820 | $7,383 |
| 2 | $27,890 | 30% | $8,367 | $837 | $7,530 |
| 3 | $28,445 | 30% | $8,534 | $854 | $7,679 |
| 4 | $29,008 | 30% | $8,702 | $870 | $7,832 |
| 5 | $29,580 | 30% | $8,874 | $887 | $7,987 |
| 6-10 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  | $175,814 |
| **Enterprise Value** | | | | | **$228,325** |
| Net Debt | | | | | -$19,000 |
| **Equity Value** | | | | | **$209,325** |
| Shares Outstanding | | | | | 280.6 |
| **Value per share** | | | | | **$746** |

**Fair Value Estimation:**

Based on these assumptions, RELX's fair value is approximately **$58.5 Billion**, or **$746 per share**.  This valuation suggests that the stock might be slightly overvalued at its current price, especially given our pessimistic assumptions. This translates to an enterprise value of **$228 billion.** 

<aside>
It's important to note that this is just one possible valuation, and a different set of assumptions would yield a different result.  Given the uncertainty surrounding RELX's future, a margin of safety is warranted.
