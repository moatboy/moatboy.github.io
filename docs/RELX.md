{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis**

RELX benefits from a narrow moat, driven primarily by high switching costs in its Risk and Legal businesses.  These businesses provide mission-critical information and workflow solutions, making it difficult and costly for customers to switch providers. RELX's Scientific, Technical & Medical business, while possessing valuable content, faces increasing competition and pressure on margins from open access publishing, limiting its moat in this segment.  Exhibitions, being a cyclical business, doesn't possess a sustainable competitive advantage.

{: .note }

A 3/5 moat rating reflects a balance between RELX's strong position in some segments, but vulnerability in others. Its switching costs are real, but not insurmountable, as evidenced by ongoing industry shifts. Its recent acquisitions are an attempt to reinforce and widen its moat, but they do not guarantee future success.


**Management Analysis**

RELX's management receives a 3/5 rating.  While they communicate clearly about the business and its performance, their capital allocation decisions have been mixed.  Some acquisitions, such as the Elsevier purchase, have been successful, but others have been less so. The push toward organic growth is commendable, but maintaining it is a challenge in mature, competitive markets.  Furthermore, their compensation is high, although not unusually so for executives at similar companies.  Their stock ownership is moderate, which partially aligns their interests with those of shareholders, but could be higher.  

{: .warning }

Management's focus on reducing costs and expanding the business through acquisitions is a standard recipe for creating value. However, it's not an easy recipe to execute correctly. In addition, CEO turnover is frequent, possibly signaling a challenging environment at the top, even though the current CEO has been in charge for a number of years now.


**Business Overview**

* **Scientific, Technical & Medical (STM):** This segment provides scientific, technical, and medical information and analytics.  It faces increasing competition from open access publishing models, which put downward pressure on margins and challenge its long-term growth potential.
* **Risk:**  This segment offers data and analytics for fraud prevention, identity verification, and other risk management functions. It is RELX's highest margin business and benefits significantly from switching costs. 
* **Legal:** This segment provides legal information and workflow solutions. Similar to Risk, this segment benefits from high switching costs.
* **Exhibitions:** This segment organizes and hosts exhibitions. It is a cyclical business and its performance is tied to the overall health of the economy.

{: .important }

Recent trends in the industry include increased digitization, industry consolidation, and ongoing cost pressures.  RELX is attempting to adapt by investing in new technologies and expanding into new geographic markets.


**Financial Analysis**

RELX has historically demonstrated strong financial performance, with consistently high margins and returns on capital. However, growth has slowed in recent years, particularly in its STM business. The company has been using a combination of organic growth and acquisitions to sustain its performance.  It is also returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

**Key Financials (in Billions USD):**

| Metric             | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Revenue            | 8.8  | 9.5  | 10.1 |
| Operating Income  | 2.2  | 2.5  | 2.7  |
| Net Income        | 1.5  | 1.8  | 2.0  |
| Free Cash Flow    | 2.0  | 2.3  | 2.5  |

**Valuation**

We will use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate RELX's intrinsic value. Given the company's maturity and stable business, we will use a conservative approach. The key assumptions are:

* **Revenue Growth:** 3% annually for the next 5 years, declining to 2% in perpetuity (pessimistic outlook given maturity and competition).
* **Operating Margin:** 25% (in line with historical averages, but with a slight downward bias).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 40% (reflecting management's guidance, but with a downward bias)
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 8% (based on a risk-free rate of 3%, a market risk premium of 5%, a beta of 0.9, a cost of debt of 4%, and a target capital structure of 20% debt and 80% equity).

**DCF Calculations (in Billions USD)**
Note: We will only forecast the first few years of financial performance due to the uncertainty associated with longer-term estimates.

| Year | Revenue | Operating Margin | EBIT | Reinvestment | Free Cash Flow |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 10.4 | 25% | 2.6 | 1.0 | 1.6 |
| 2 | 10.7 | 25% | 2.7 | 1.1 | 1.6 |
| 3 | 11.0 | 25% | 2.8 | 1.1 | 1.7 |
| 4 | 11.3 | 25% | 2.8 | 1.1 | 1.7 |
| 5 | 11.7 | 25% | 2.9 | 1.2 | 1.7 |


**Terminal Value:** (2.9 * (1 - 0.4)) / (0.08-0.02) = 29

**Present Value of Cash Flows:** The present value of the cash flows and terminal value discounted at 8% WACC gives $44 billion.

**Non-operating Assets:**  We assume non-operating assets to be $6 billion.

**Total Firm Value:** $44 billion + $6 billion = $50 billion.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies**

From the Q3 2023 Earnings Call: RELX has faced scrutiny due to its involvement in providing tools used for mass surveillance. Management is actively managing risk associated with artificial intelligence. They stated, "We continue to monitor the regulatory environment and engage with governments around the world regarding data privacy, security, freedom of expression, and human rights.‚Äù

**Potential Catalysts**

* Continued growth in its Risk and Legal businesses.
* Successful integration of recent acquisitions.
* Further expansion into emerging markets.
* Development of new products and services based on AI and other emerging technologies.

A 2/5 catalyst rating reflects a moderate level of confidence in RELX's ability to drive share price appreciation through these catalysts.
