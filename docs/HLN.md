{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Haleon's moat primarily stems from its **intangible assets**â€”namely, its brand portfolio (Sensodyne, Panadol, Advil, Voltaren, etc.).  While these brands are recognizable and consumers exhibit some purchasing habits, switching costs are low, particularly when cheaper alternatives exist.  This is supported by Pat Dorsey's *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, which emphasizes that a brand only constitutes an economic moat if it gives pricing power. While Haleon's well-established brands likely provide a degree of pricing power, they are not as defensible as, say, a patented pharmaceutical product. Additionally, the company's products face competition from both branded and generic offerings, limiting pricing power and profitability.  As Michael Porter notes in *Competitive Advantage*, brand loyalty, while nice to have, is not enough to create a long-term competitive advantage, especially in consumer staples.

{: .note }

Haleon's large size confers some cost advantages through economies of scale, particularly in distribution and manufacturing. However, as discussed in *Valuation*, even economies of scale are not necessarily sources of enduring moats, as global competitors can achieve similar efficiencies.


**Management (3/5):**

{: .important }
* **Experience and Execution:**  Haleon's management team is relatively new and is still establishing its track record as an independent entity.  The CEO, Brian McNamara, has experience in consumer health at GSK.  While he oversaw GSK Consumer Healthcare before the spin-off, his ability to navigate Haleon as a stand-alone company remains to be fully tested.  There is potential for a positive managerial surprise as the team is incentivized to prove its worth after the spin-off, similar to the cases of successful spin-offs described in *Creating Value Through Divestitures*.  However, maintaining margins and growth in an increasingly competitive environment will be crucial. This need for consistent execution reduces the management rating.

* **Communication:**  Management's communication, while generally transparent,  has at times focused on adjusted metrics and organic revenue growth, which, as Aswath Damodaran cautions in *The Little Book of Valuation*, can obscure the true economic reality and does not always translate into value creation. This focus on adjusted earnings and metrics, which can be easily manipulated, as described in *Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings*, reduces management's rating.  For instance, in the Q3 2022 earnings call, they discuss prioritizing organic growth with moderate operating margin. However, there was a lot of information provided on non-IFRS measures, which does not provide enough insight on the true financial performance.

* **Capital Allocation:** The company has engaged in some acquisitions, but their true success will be evaluated over a longer period. Moreover, recent increases in debt following the spin-off,  as noted in the Q2 2023 earnings call, may limit the company's ability to continue to invest for growth and raise future profitability.  There are concerns over how effectively that capital will be utilized to generate profits. More disciplined use of cash to increase ROIC would be preferable.

* **Insider Ownership:** Limited information is available on management's ownership stake, but it does not appear to be substantial.  While this alignment can be positive, stronger insider ownership would further align management's interests with those of outside shareholders.

* **Compensation:** Executive compensation, as detailed in the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Report, is tied to both financial and operational metrics, which is a start. However, a stricter focus on value creation and ROIC would better incentivize management to make value-maximizing decisions.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Improving Margins and Cost Control:** As mentioned in the Q3 2022 earnings call, management's stated strategic priority is organic growth with moderate operating margins. If management is able to demonstrate success in this area, investors may be persuaded to pay higher multiples for the stock, increasing the share price, as suggested in the *Little Book of Valuation*. However, this is a standard operating procedure for many managers, so it is not considered to be a very strong potential catalyst.

* **Successful Integration of Acquisitions:** Haleon has made several acquisitions, including the acquisition of a portfolio of over-the-counter brands from Sanofi in 2022, as mentioned in the company's annual report. Realizing synergistic savings or revenue improvements from these acquisitions could boost earnings and make the stock more attractive to intrinsic investors. However, realizing synergies is challenging, as highlighted in *Mergers and Acquisitions*, reducing the likelihood of this materializing. 

{: .warning }

There is a possibility that management might use some acquisitions as an excuse for reducing their current profitability and generating "growth", as explained in the "Acquisitions" chapter of *Valuation*.


**Valuation ($36.5 Billion):**

Given that Haleon is a new, separate company, historical financials only provide limited insight.  Therefore, this valuation is primarily based on the 2022 results adjusted for the spin-off and available segment information, with a discounted cash flow model being the primary technique.  A conservative and pessimistic set of assumptions has been used to arrive at the valuation.

**Key Inputs and Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 4% annually for the next 5 years, then 2% in perpetuity. (Consumer Healthcare market growth is expected to be moderate, and increased competition is expected. This assumption was made using the process for valuing young growth companies described in the book.)
* **Operating Margin:**  25% in year 5, converging to 23% by year 10, and then flat. (Margin expansion is possible through increased scale and efficiency, but competitive pressures could keep margins from expanding further. This assumption was based on the median ROICs provided in Exhibit 4.1.)
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (Effective tax rate. No specific information is available in company documents, but I have seen the company operating in many different countries. This assumption is based on the tax rate in the U.S. and the UK and tax accounting requirements.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  Determined based on the expected stable growth rate and return on capital.
* **Cost of Capital:** 10%. (The health care sector is generally assigned a lower cost of capital due to perceived stability, but uncertainty around future profitability increases Haleon's risk. The risk-free rate was assumed to be 3.25% for 10-year U.S. treasuries in August 2023. The risk premium was assumed to be 4.5%. The beta for the equity of Haleon was assumed to be 0.8. Its debt was assumed to have a rating of A, with an after-tax cost of debt of 4.2% at the time of writing this evaluation. Haleon's capital structure was assumed to have a debt to capital ratio of around 15%, although it is currently higher, as explained in the section on financial restructuring.)
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2% (long-run nominal growth rate for mature economies). (This assumption is consistent with the long-term fundamentals described in chapter 3.)
* **Probability of Failure:** 10%.  The probability is assigned to the consumer product company to maintain a 22.6% ROIC and also to account for the high debt/cap ratio in 2022. (This assumption was made with the information on financial distress rates in *Valuation* and the earnings power of consumer staples being typically near the WACC.)

**Calculations:**

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projections:**
Project FCF for the next 10 years using the assumptions above.
2. **Terminal Value:**  Calculate the terminal value at year 10 using the perpetuity growth model and the cost of capital.
3. **Present Value of FCF:** Discount the FCF projections and the terminal value back to today using the cost of capital.
4. **Value of Operating Assets:** Sum the present values of the FCF.
5. **Value of Nonoperating Assets:** Haleon has a relatively clean balance sheet.  Value any minority interest investments and excess cash.  Subtract out debt.
6. **Probability-Weighted Value:** Adjust for the probability of failure and liquidation value as explained in *Valuation* and *The Little Book that Builds Wealth*.

**Overall Assessment:**

Haleon is a company with some interesting brands but a challenging competitive landscape. Its position in the fast-moving consumer goods space makes it vulnerable to changing consumer preferences, competition, and economic downturns. Management's ability to execute on margin improvements and cost control will be critical to the company's success. Based on a conservative valuation, with a pessimistic and skeptical outlook, a fair value for Haleon is estimated to be approximately $36.5 billion, as of the end of its first fiscal year in 2022.  This valuation reflects both opportunities and risks.

**Recent Developments and Outlook**:

* **Inflationary Pressures:** Like many companies, Haleon has been affected by higher input costs, particularly in the first fiscal year. In their 2022 annual report, management mentions its strategy of adjusting for input cost volatility with pricing adjustments. The success of this strategy, and the ability to maintain margins, is a key risk going forward and the recent economic turmoil could reduce prices and margins even more.

* **Portfolio Optimization:** Haleon continues to evaluate its portfolio and explore opportunities for both acquisitions and divestitures. In the Q2 2023 earnings call, management discussed actively managing its portfolio.  Strategic acquisitions or divestitures could be value-enhancing.

* **Geographic Expansion:**  The company is focused on expanding into emerging markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America. As noted in their 2022 annual report, these geographic areas represent a growth opportunity, but with substantial political risk. Managing and mitigating this risk, and maintaining profitability in the face of local market competition and challenges, will be critical for this to be successful. This geographical diversification was noted by Mr. McNamara in the Q2 2023 earnings call.
