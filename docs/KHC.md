Pessimistic value: $44.45 billion

**Investment Thesis:** Kraft Heinz possesses a narrow moat, stemming primarily from its brand name and scale advantages in the packaged food industry. However, its moat has been eroding due to intense competition, changing consumer preferences (towards healthier and fresher options), and the company's struggles with innovation and brand management.  Management's recent strategic focus on streamlining operations and reinvesting in core brands offers some potential for improvement, but the company faces an uphill battle in a mature, low-growth industry. Recent financial results and management actions suggest a mixed picture. While cost-cutting initiatives have yielded some margin improvement, revenue growth remains a challenge. The company’s substantial debt load also adds to the risk profile.  Based on a DCF valuation, with a conservative outlook, the company appears to be modestly undervalued.

{: .warning }

**Concerns and Controversies:** Kraft Heinz has faced criticism for its substantial debt load and its accounting practices related to goodwill. The company has also struggled to find a consistent and successful growth strategy, resulting in several large write-downs and impairments in recent years. Management's cost-cutting measures, while improving margins, have raised concerns about their potential long-term negative impact on brand equity. Additionally, KHC faces significant exposure to inflation risk, as seen in recent earnings calls.

**Potential Catalysts:**
* **Reinvestment in core brands:**  Management's increased focus on reinvesting in core brands and marketing could yield positive results over the medium term. *(Refer to Q1 2023 Earnings Call)*  This includes modernization of some of their offerings to cater to changing consumer tastes as suggested by the CEO Miguel Patricio *(refer to the KHC 2022 10-K investor presentation)*. This focus on core brands could potentially enhance brand equity and drive revenue growth.
* **Emerging markets growth:**  Kraft Heinz has the potential to benefit from growth in emerging markets, where its brands still hold significant appeal. *(Refer to Q2 2023 Earnings Call)*
* **Improved execution:**  Improved execution on cost-cutting initiatives and better financial discipline could boost earnings and cash flow.
* **Cost cutting initiatives:** The company’s management has implemented cost cutting in procurement, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and administration, by making a commitment to maintain their overall margins, despite decreasing revenues. *(Refer to the KHC 2022 10-K)*.
* **Share Repurchase:** There has been substantial share repurchase activity totaling over $1 billion in 2019 and 2020. *(Refer to the KHC 2020 10-K)*.


**Catalyst Rating: 2/5.** While the catalysts listed above offer some potential for improvement,  the company faces significant challenges that could limit their impact. Competition remains intense, and the company's track record of execution has been inconsistent.  Therefore, a moderate rating is appropriate.

**Management Rating: 2/5.** While the current management team has articulated a sound long-term strategy, their execution has been inconsistent. Concerns remain about their ability to effectively allocate capital and manage the company’s large debt load. Also, management compensation appears to be heavily weighted towards stock options, which raises concerns about their long-term focus. While management owns a tiny amount of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 2008, there is no mention of insider holding in subsequent years in the financial documents. Executive turnover has also been a concern in recent years, with several key personnel changes.  *(Refer to various KHC Earnings Calls and 10-Ks)*

**Financial Performance History** (See KHC 10-K 2022 and previous years' filings for detailed financial information)

* **Revenue:**  Declining or stagnant in recent years. Management attributes this to challenging market conditions, competition, and currency headwinds.
* **Margins:**  Margins have shown some improvement due to cost-cutting measures. 
* **Debt:**  Substantial debt load remains a concern, increasing financial risk.
* **Capital Allocation:** A mixed record.  While management has repurchased shares and paid dividends, there have been large write-downs and impairments in the recent past. There seems to be no large share repurchases in recent years and the company is still under debt. 
* **Communication:** The company communicates fairly transparently and honestly about its business environment and results in the earnings calls but they don’t communicate about the amount of cash flow and its distribution, unlike its competitor Conagra.

**Business Overview:**

Kraft Heinz is a leading packaged food company with a global presence. Its portfolio includes many iconic brands, such as Kraft, Heinz, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, and Maxwell House. 

* **Revenue Distribution:**  The company generates revenue from a diversified portfolio of food products, primarily consisting of cheese and dairy, condiments and sauces, easy meals, nuts, salted snacks, infant/nutrition, fresh and other products. Geographic revenue concentration can vary significantly between years, with a substantial portion of revenues typically coming from North America, followed by Europe and Rest of World.
* **Industry Trends:**  The packaged food industry is a mature, low-growth industry, characterized by intense competition and changing consumer preferences. There is a strong tendency in this sector towards industry consolidation as larger players tend to swallow smaller players. KHC competes with the likes of Conagra and General Mills.
* **Competitive Landscape:**  The packaged food industry is highly competitive, with many large, well-established companies. Kraft Heinz's primary competitive advantages are its brand name and economies of scale. The company also competes on price, product quality, and innovation, which makes it very hard for investors to accurately estimate what is really driving ROIC.
* **What Makes Kraft Heinz Different:**  The company's portfolio of iconic brands is a key differentiator. However, the company has struggled to innovate and adapt to changing consumer preferences in recent years.


**Valuation (DCF):**

The valuation is performed using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model.  Given the uncertainty surrounding Kraft Heinz's future growth and profitability, a two-stage DCF model is used, with a 10-year explicit forecast period followed by a terminal value. A conservative approach is taken in making the assumptions, particularly with regard to growth and margins.

**Key Assumptions:**


| Item                            | Years 1-5   | Years 6-10 | Terminal |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Revenue growth                  | 1.00%      | 1.00%      | 1.00%    |
| Operating Margin                  | 14.50%     | 15.00%     | 15.00%   |
| Tax rate                          | 20.00%     | 20.00%     | 20.00%   |
| Reinvestment rate (Sales to IC) | 3.00       | 3.00       | -        |
| Cost of Equity                    | 9.00%      | 9.00%      | 9.00%    |
| Cost of Debt                      | 4.00%      | 4.00%      | 4.00%    |
| WACC                            | 7.56%      | 7.56%      | 7.56%    |

**Key Assumptions Justification**


* **Revenue Growth:**  A conservative growth rate of 1% is assumed, reflecting the mature and competitive nature of the packaged food industry and in-line with inflation.
* **Operating Margin:** A slight improvement in operating margins is assumed, reflecting management's cost-cutting initiatives. However, margins are expected to remain below historical levels due to increased competition.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  A reinvestment rate of 3.00 (sales to invested capital) is assumed, reflecting KHC’s recent reinvestment history.
* **Cost of Equity:** The cost of equity is estimated using CAPM, assuming a risk-free rate of 4% (10-year US Treasury bond rate), a market risk premium of 5.5%, and a beta of 0.92 for KHC, which is obtained from Bloomberg based on historical capital structure and adjusted for market beta movement. This beta is somewhat higher than KHC’s earlier values because of the debt taken on recently as explained by Warren Buffet in his Berkshire Hathway letters to shareholders. The equity risk premium is at its historical average of 5.5% as used in McKinsey's "Valuation". The resulting pretax cost of equity is 9% but it can increase or decrease in later years if the management changes their financing policies dramatically.
* **Cost of Debt:** The cost of debt is assumed to be 4.00%, reflecting the current yield on KHC's outstanding debt as of December 31, 2022 as provided by the company in their earnings call of Q4 2022.
* **WACC:** The WACC is calculated using the market value weights of debt and equity as of December 31, 2022, along with the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt. The market value of debt is estimated at $22,070 million, whereas the market value of equity is estimated at $44,476 million.
* **Capital structure:** It is assumed that KHC will hold this capital structure for a long time.

**Valuation Calculation Details:**

The following calculations are performed using the two-stage DCF model. The explicit forecast of earnings, cash flow, reinvestment, WACC, and the continuing value are for the years 2023 through 2032. All numbers are in US millions of USD.

1. **Free Cash Flow Projection:**  Free cash flow is projected for the explicit forecast period (10 years), based on the revenue growth and margin assumptions, as well as the reinvestment rate.

| Year | Revenue | EBIT  | Reinvestment (1-t) | FCFF    |
|------|---------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1    | 27,015  | 3,932 | 836             | -443    |
| 2    | 27,285  | 4,073 | 847             | -373    |
| 3    | 27,558  | 4,216 | 858             | -302    |
| 4    | 27,834  | 4,362 | 869             | -230    |
| 5    | 28,112  | 4,511 | 880             | -158    |
| 6    | 28,393  | 4,664 | 892             | -85     |
| 7    | 28,677  | 4,819 | 904             | -12     |
| 8    | 28,964  | 4,979 | 916             | 60      |
| 9    | 29,254  | 5,143 | 928             | 132     |
| 10   | 29,548  | 5,310 | 941             | 204     |


2. **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity growth method, assuming a perpetual growth rate of 1% (consistent with the long-term revenue growth assumption), a return on capital of 10%, and a WACC of 7.56% (calculated earlier).


```
Terminal Value = (FCFF in year 11)/(WACC-g) = $5366 million.
```

3. **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:**  The present value of the projected free cash flows and the terminal value are calculated using the WACC as the discount rate. This valuation assumes that cash flows will come in average in the middle of the year.

| Year | FCFF    | Terminal Value | Discount Factor | PV     |
|------|---------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1    | -443    |                | 0.9637          | -427   |
| 2    | -373    |                | 0.9286          | -346   |
| 3    | -302    |                | 0.8945          | -270   |
| 4    | -230    |                | 0.8615          | -198   |
| 5    | -158    |                | 0.8295          | -131   |
| 6    | -85     |                | 0.7985          | -68    |
| 7    | -12     |                | 0.7685          | -9     |
| 8    | 60      |                | 0.7394          | 44     |
| 9    | 132     |                | 0.7112          | 94     |
| 10   | 204     |                | 0.6840          | 139     |
| 11   |         | 5,366           | 0.6840          | 3,666   |
