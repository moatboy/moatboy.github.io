# Alphabet
{: .fs-9 }

Moat: 4/5

Pessimistic value: $950 B

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is a dominant force in the digital advertising and cloud computing markets. Its vast reach, coupled with network effects and intangible assets, creates a formidable moat, although a few cracks are appearing.

>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**The Business**

Alphabet's business model is anchored in two primary segments:

* **Google Services:** This includes Google Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and Android, among others. These services are largely free to users, generating revenue primarily through advertising. Network effects play a significant role in driving WTP for Google's services. The more users there are on these platforms, the more appealing they become to advertisers, and the more data Google can collect to refine ad targeting.
* **Google Cloud:** This segment offers cloud computing services, including infrastructure, platform services, and collaboration tools. While Google Cloud has been growing rapidly, it faces intense competition from established players like Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure).
Alphabet also has a portfolio of "Other Bets," which are early-stage ventures in a variety of sectors. While these ventures have the potential to become significant businesses in the future, they currently contribute little to Alphabet's overall financials.

**Moat: 4/5 â€“ Wide**

Alphabet's wide moat stems from the following sources:

* **Intangible Assets (Brand):** Google's brand name is synonymous with search, giving it immense pricing power in the advertising market. However, the company's dependence on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to both cyclical economic downturns (reducing advertiser budgets) and changes in consumer behavior (shifting away from traditional digital media consumption).
* **Network Effects:** Google Services, particularly Search and YouTube, benefit from powerful network effects. The more users there are on these platforms, the more appealing they become to both advertisers and content creators. A large user base also creates more data, enabling Google to improve ad targeting and personalization and increase the effectiveness of its services. However, the moat is not unbreachable. TikTok's emergence underscores that new formats and platforms can disrupt Google's dominance, especially with younger users.
* **Switching Costs:**  Switching costs for users of Google Services are low, but switching costs for advertisers can be substantial. Integrating with Google's advertising ecosystem requires investments in time and resources, and shifting to another platform can create disruptions and uncertainty. This "stickiness" gives Google pricing power in the advertising market. However, a continued perception that Google is abusing its market dominance, by prioritizing its own products and services over competitors, could lower switching costs, as advertisers seek alternative platforms to avoid potential discrimination.
* **Cost Advantages (Scale):**  Google's massive scale allows it to invest in and leverage data and infrastructure in ways that few competitors can match. This scale gives Google a cost advantage in both digital advertising and cloud computing. However, the benefits of scale are not unlimited. As the company grows, the incremental return on investment from new investments can decline and the management of a global firm becomes more complex, increasing costs.

**Valuation: $950 billion**

Determining a precise intrinsic value for Alphabet is challenging, given the uncertainty surrounding future growth rates, profit margins, and the long-term effects of changes in technology and user behavior.
In our base-case valuation of Alphabet, we focus on the following key assumptions and inputs:

* **Cash Flows:** We forecast revenues, operating margins, reinvestment, and free cash flows to the firm (FCFF) for the next 10 years, using the data from Alphabet's 2023 10K, as the starting point.
* **Growth:** We assume that revenue growth will slow to 8 percent over the next five years, before declining to a terminal growth rate of 3 percent, the risk-free rate.
* **Margins:** We assume that Alphabet will be able to maintain its existing operating margin of 27%, reflecting its continuing dominance of the digital advertising market.
* **Reinvestment:** We estimate reinvestment needs based on the global industry average for technology firms of sales-to-capital of approximately 3, reflecting the intangible assets-heavy nature of the business.
* **Cost of Capital:** Given Alphabet's strong credit rating, large cash balances and its size, we estimate a cost of capital of 9%, which we hold constant in perpetuity.
* **Terminal Value:** We use the terminal value equation to estimate the value of the operating assets after year 10.
Based on these assumptions, we estimate a present value of $768.2 billion for Alphabet's operating assets. Adding cash and marketable securities ($110.9 billion) and netting out debt ($14.7 billion) and adjusting for 5% probability of failure and discounted cash flow yields an equity value for Alphabet of roughly $950 billion and a value per share of $141.51, based on its 6.718 billion shares.

Given the inherent uncertainty in valuing a company like Alphabet, we also analyze a range of
scenarios and stories and use them in our estimates of valuation. If you are an intrinsic value
investor looking for bargains, or stocks that you can buy at a price lower than their value, the
discount to intrinsic value that you look for before buying should increase with how uncertain you
feel about your assessment. With Alphabet, even with this pessimistic and skeptical
assessment, there is not much of a discount to our estimated intrinsic value, and even that may
be too optimistic given the uncertainty embedded in that estimate.
