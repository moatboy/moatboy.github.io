{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):** 

Barclays has a narrow moat based primarily on its scale and some customer switching costs, but this moat is being chipped away by increased competition, tighter regulation and the rise of fintech.

* **Scale:** Barclays benefits from economies of scale in retail banking in the United Kingdom. This allows them to spread fixed costs over a very large revenue base and offer a wider range of services.
* **Switching Costs:** Retail bank customers and wealth management clients demonstrate some degree of stickiness, due to the hassle of switching financial accounts and the embeddedness of the bank in their financial lives.
* **Moat Erosion:** The moat, however, has narrowed significantly in recent years. Increased competition, particularly from new entrants and fintech companies, has put pressure on margins and returns on capital. Moreover, regulatory changes aimed at increasing stability in the banking sector, like ring-fencing in the UK, have increased operating costs and reduced Barclays’ flexibility.

**Management (2/5):**

Barclays’ management has had a mixed record over the past decade. It has navigated the firm through various financial and regulatory crises, but it has also made some questionable capital-allocation decisions and suffered from conduct issues.

* **Experience:** The current CEO, C.S. Venkatakrishnan, has a long history in banking, including significant experience at Barclays.  However, his short tenure as CEO (appointed in November 2021) doesn’t provide a long enough track record to fully assess his long-term performance.
{: .warning }
* **Capital Allocation:** Historically, management hasn't always allocated capital efficiently. The bank has been prone to take big swings, particularly in investment banking, which have sometimes resulted in large losses.
{: .important }
* **Conduct:** Barclays has been plagued by conduct issues, including scandals related to Libor manipulation and payment protection insurance. These scandals have damaged the bank’s reputation and led to substantial fines.
{: .note }
* **Communication and Transparency:** While Barclays’ investor relations team has improved its communications with the market, the bank remains relatively opaque in reporting its financials, especially in terms of granular detail for its individual business units.
* **Compensation:** The bank’s executive compensation system has faced criticism from some investors for being excessively tied to short-term performance metrics. This may incentivize actions that boost short-term profits at the expense of long-term value creation.

**Catalyst (1/5):**

There are no significant near-term catalysts to drive the share price meaningfully higher. The stock may benefit marginally from a cyclical upturn in the UK economy and any easing of regulatory pressure on banks, but these tailwinds are likely to be offset by competitive headwinds.

**Business:**

* **Barclays UK:** This segment provides retail banking, credit cards, and other financial products and services to customers in the United Kingdom. It faces intense competition from other large banks, including Lloyds, NatWest, and HSBC, as well as from challenger banks and fintech firms.
* **Barclays International:** This segment includes corporate and investment banking and wealth management. It operates in several geographic regions, including the Americas, Europe, and Asia. This segment is particularly focused on serving large multinational corporations.
* **Industry Trends:** The banking industry is facing several headwinds, including increasing regulation, low interest rates, and the rise of fintech. These trends have compressed profit margins and returns on capital across the industry.  Banks are also under increasing pressure to invest in technology to improve their digital offerings and to defend their market share from new entrants.
* **Differentiation:** Barclays doesn't have a meaningful competitive advantage over its peers, especially given the high dependence on credit and interest rate spreads, though it emphasizes its universal banking model.


**Financials:**

<details>
<summary>Barclays PLC Consolidated Income Statement (£ Billions)</summary>

| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total income | 21.6 | 21.8 | 21.9 |
| Operating expenses | 13.6 | 14.6 | 13.7 |
| Impairment of financial instruments | 0.4 | 5.2 | 0.5 |
| Net operating income | 7.6 | 2.0 | 7.7 |
| Net income | 3.2 | -0.2 | 6.4 |
| Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity (RoTE) | 3.5% | -0.2% | 9.9% |

**Profitability Analysis:** As evident from the table above, Barclays’ profitability (measured by RoTE) declined sharply in 2020 primarily due to the massive increase in loan-loss provisions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, but recovered in 2021 as loan-loss provisions receded and revenues continued to increase gradually. It is worth noting that Barclays' financial performance tends to be volatile with credit risk being the biggest driver of that volatility.

<summary>Barclays PLC Consolidated Balance Sheet (£ Billions)</summary>

| Year | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total assets | 1,482 | 1,680 | 1,747 |
| Total liabilities | 1,384 | 1,569 | 1,640 |
| Total shareholders’ equity | 98 | 111 | 107 |
| Leverage ratio (Equity / Assets) | 6.6% | 6.6% | 6.2% |

**Capital Structure and Financial Risk:**  The leverage ratio remained stable in recent years. The bank maintained a healthy capital base. However, the company's risk profile has been affected by the recent economic downturns, requiring an increase in loan loss provisions to reflect increased risk of default in the loan portfolio.

**Valuation (Adjusted Present Value Approach):**

To estimate the value of Barclays, we will use the Adjusted Present Value (APV) approach, which is a modified version of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) approach that explicitly models the value of the tax shield created by the company’s use of debt. APV is best suited for mature companies with reasonably stable cash flows and a history of debt usage, and Barclays satisfies these criteria.

* **Discount Period:** 10 years, as this allows the company to reach a more mature state.


* **Terminal Period:** Perpetual growth.



* **Cash flows:** Free cash flow to firm (FCFF), based on an average of the last three years of cash flow and projected free cash flow from consensus estimates.


* **Discount Rate:** Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).


<details>
<summary>WACC calculation details</summary>

* **Cost of Equity:** We use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and a beta of 1.0, the risk-free rate of 4.5% based on the 10-year UK gilt, and the equity risk premium of 5%. This is based on the observation that Barclays' equity price movements are more than 85% explained by its risk-free beta. The resulting cost of equity is 9.5%.


* **Cost of Debt:** We use an average yield to maturity (YTM) of 6.2% on Barclays’ long-term corporate bonds. This is based on their rating as an A-rated issuer and observed yields of newly-issued bonds by similarly rated issuers.


* **Target Capital Structure:** We adopt a slightly conservative approach with a 20/80 debt-to-capital ratio, in line with the company’s historical capital structure and regulatory requirements.  This is based on the assessment that bank regulations regarding capital ratio are critical to maintain market valuations at high levels


* **Tax Rate:** 25%. This is a rounded average of Barclay's average rate over the past few years.

**WACC = (0.2 * 6.2% * (1 – 0.25)) + (0.8 * 9.5%) = 8.5%**

<summary>FCFF calculation details (£ Billions)</summary>

* **2021 FCFF:** £2.05 (from financials)
* **2022 FCFF:** £1.39 (from financials)
* **2023 FCFF:** £2.88 (from consensus estimates)
* **2024-2031 FCFF:** £2.88 * 1.02 (2% growth rate)


For calculating cash flows beyond 2023, the 2% growth is based on the UK’s long-run GDP growth rate, which is a reasonable assumption.

<summary>DCF Calculations (£ Billions)</summary>

| Year | FCFF | PV Factor (8.5%) | PV of FCFF |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 | 2.88 | 0.922 | 2.66 |
| 2024 | 2.94 | 0.850 | 2.50 |
| 2025 | 3.00 | 0.783 | 2.35 |
| 2026 | 3.06 | 0.721 | 2.21 |
| 2027 | 3.12 | 0.665 | 2.07 |
| 2028 | 3.18 | 0.614 | 1.95 |
| 2029 | 3.24 | 0.567 | 1.84 |
| 2030 | 3.31 | 0.524 | 1.73 |
| 2031 | 3.37 | 0.485 | 1.64 |
| Terminal Value |  | 0.485 | 19.82 |
| Total Enterprise Value |  |  | 40.77 |

For the terminal value, I assumed a 2% growth rate in perpetuity because I believe that even under the most favorable circumstances it is unlikely that the company will be able to grow beyond the long-term GDP growth rate and even that would require continued efforts by management, which, although not impossible given the company’s track record, seems less likely, given the challenging economic environment and the increasing competitive intensity in most parts of its business.

</details>


Using these calculations, discounted at a WACC of 8.5%, the enterprise value of Barclays is estimated to be £40.77 billion. Adjusting this for cash holdings, minority interests, and other financial claims and dividing by the shares outstanding (excluding dilutions), we arrive at a value per share of  $5.23, which translates to a value for the company's shares outstanding of around $41.73 billion.

**Key Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Investment Banking Losses:** In its 2023 first-quarter earnings call, Barclays’ CEO addressed the issue of losses in its investment banking division, highlighting that these were largely due to one-off factors, like hedging against a rise in interest rates, and expressing confidence in the long-term prospects of the business. However, given the cyclical nature of investment banking and the potential for future shocks to credit markets, the losses raise concerns about the sustainability of profitability in this segment.


* **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Barclays continues to face regulatory scrutiny related to its past conduct issues. This could lead to additional fines and penalties, which would weigh on the company’s financial performance. In its 2023 first-quarter earnings call, management emphasized that it is committed to improving its compliance and risk management framework, which, although a necessary step, does not guarantee that there won’t be further regulatory actions.


**Recent Financial News:**

* **Sale of Payments Business:**  In June 2022, Barclays announced that it had begun a strategic review of its payments business.  It is worth noting that although divestitures often create value by increasing the market value of previously underperforming assets, the sale of a profitable business may be interpreted negatively by investors, unless they are convinced about the future prospects of the remaining assets. This would be a negative, as management clearly did not identify it as being one. This is worth watching.


* **Cost-Cutting Measures:** Barclays has been implementing cost-cutting measures to improve its profitability.  In its 2023 first-quarter earnings call, management highlighted the success of these measures, but emphasized that there is more work to be done.  Given the challenging operating environment, it is imperative that Barclays continue to manage its costs aggressively to protect its margins.
