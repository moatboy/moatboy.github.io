**Concerns/Controversies:**
>“The market increasingly demands…that companies improve their earnings.” - Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits

One key recent concern around Oracle relates to its transition to the cloud. While the company has made significant strides, questions remain about its ability to fully compete with established players like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.  Further, competition is intensifying within almost every market. Oracle's recent acquisitions, such as Cerner, also face regulatory scrutiny, which adds an element of uncertainty.  In a recent earnings call (Q4 FY23), CEO Safra Catz said, “Cerner’s revenue was impacted by the timing of large bookings and the strength of the U.S. dollar… We expect to improve Cerner’s revenue growth throughout the year.” This suggests that the Cerner acquisition is still in a transitional phase and its success is not yet fully realized.  

Another concern revolves around the competitive landscape within the broader technology industry.  Competition is intensifying in almost all segments, which could put pressure on margins and revenue growth.  In Q4 FY23 earnings call, chairman and CTO Larry Ellison addressed this by saying, “Microsoft—despite its enormous resources—has been remarkably unsuccessful in engineering its own autonomous system… We believe our Generation 2 Cloud with its enormous cost advantages in running and building data centers is just too high a hurdle for Microsoft to overcome. That's our prediction. Maybe we're wrong.” This statement, while confident, reveals the pressure from competitors and the need for continuous innovation and cost optimization to maintain market share.

**Potential Catalysts:**
>“Oracle Cloud applications are inherently modular and provide out-of-the-box functionality to support an organization’s existing practices.” - ORCL Q3 FY24 10-Q

Several potential catalysts could boost Oracle's share price. Continued success in its cloud transition and gaining market share from competitors would be a significant driver.  Further penetration into emerging markets, leveraging its cost advantages, and successful integration of Cerner could also contribute. Innovation in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and further development of its autonomous database could drive growth. As mentioned in a recent filing, “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (“OCI”)…delivers best-in-class services because it is purpose-built…on a common, standards-based architecture…”, suggesting that their infrastructure has a competitive advantage that could be leveraged for future growth.

### Business Overview

**Revenues Distribution:** Oracle's revenue streams are diversified across cloud services and license support, hardware, and services. The cloud business is becoming increasingly important, with cloud services and license support generating 80% of total revenues in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024.

**Industry Trends:** The enterprise software market is undergoing a period of rapid change and consolidation.  Cloud computing is a major force and companies are increasingly moving their operations to the cloud. 

**Margins:** Oracle maintains a high operating margin, reflecting its strong competitive position. Its cloud business has higher margins than its traditional on-premise software business.  As the cloud business continues to become a larger portion of its revenue mix, overall margins should improve.  As noted by a contributor to Free Encyclopedia, “Companies with better than average profit margins can sustain those advantages if they are a low-cost operator, or if they have developed a reputation for product quality.”

**Competitive Landscape:**  Oracle faces intense competition from large, well-financed competitors such as Microsoft, SAP, and Amazon Web Services.  In the database market, its main competitors are Microsoft and Amazon. In cloud infrastructure, Microsoft Azure and AWS dominate the market.

**Differentiators:**  Oracle's key differentiators include its autonomous database, its integrated suite of cloud applications, and its large, existing customer base.  As observed by Bruce Greenwald, “The key to successful long-term competitive advantage is barriers to entry.”  Oracle's extensive suite of products and switching costs for its existing customers provide formidable barriers to entry.

### Moat Analysis

Oracle has a narrow moat, assigned a rating of 3 out of 5. This rating is based on switching costs, network effects (for certain products), and economies of scale, which provide a degree of protection against competition, especially for legacy customers in certain segments of the company's business.  The company also benefits from cost advantages stemming from operating leverage and owning unique assets or resources.

**Switching Costs:**  Oracle's enterprise software products are often deeply integrated into a company's operations, making it costly and time-consuming for customers to switch to a competing product. This high switching costs provide Oracle pricing power and resilience in tough economic times. This “lock-in” for certain segments is a clear moat characteristic. This is reflected in their consistently high customer retention rate.

**Network Effect:**  Certain Oracle products, such as its database software, benefit from network effects. As more companies use Oracle's database, it becomes more valuable, making it more difficult for competitors to displace.  

>“Many of the products they sell have moats.” - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

**Economies of Scale:**  Oracle's large size provides it with cost advantages in research and development, marketing, and sales.  These economies of scale enable Oracle to offer competitive pricing and invest heavily in developing new products and services. The relative ease with which technology can be produced gives them the possibility of scaling to global levels. This is also mentioned in an interview by a contributor to Forbes when speaking about a technology business’ valuation, “There is no limit to the universe of users… and the benefit from the network effect increases as the number of users grows.” This ease of scalability helps contribute to Oracle’s moat.

**Intangible Assets:** Oracle’s reputation for quality and reliability, built over decades, constitutes a source of durable competitive advantage.  Although they are not as powerful as other intangible assets like valuable brands, these factors create additional barriers to entry for newcomers.

{: .important }

**Moat Sustainability:** Oracle's moat is narrow and is likely to stay at 3 out of 5 in the near-term but is facing pressure due to the ongoing cloud transition and intensifying competition. Continuous innovation and effective capital allocation will be crucial for maintaining and widening its moat over time. However, recent trends like faster technological change and regulatory challenges could weaken it.  As Michael Mauboussin pointed out in The Little Book of Valuation, “Growth can be negative, as firms shed assets and revenues shrink.”  Even great companies can suffer from erosion.

### Management Analysis

Oracle's management team receives a rating of 3 out of 5. The rating is driven primarily by the team's long tenure, operational expertise, and focus on cost control. However, concerns about capital allocation decisions and the potential for excessive executive compensation weigh on the rating.

>“If you discover that the firm is in financial trouble…you can still make money.” - The Little Book That Beats the Market

**Experience and Tenure:**  Larry Ellison and Safra Catz have decades of experience at Oracle and possess deep knowledge of the company's business and the technology industry. This experience is crucial for navigating the ongoing cloud transition.

**Capital Allocation:** Oracle has a mixed record in terms of capital allocation.  While the company has been aggressive in pursuing acquisitions, some have questioned the wisdom of certain deals, particularly those perceived as overpriced.  As pointed out by Warren Buffett, “Growth is not always worth paying for.”

>“The best place to invest may not always be your own backyard.” - The Intelligent Investor

**Compensation:**  Executive compensation at Oracle has been a source of controversy, with some arguing that executive pay is excessive. This raises concerns about management's focus on shareholder value.  As mentioned in The Intelligent Investor, “It is far better to focus on the future prospects of your holdings and not the past performance of the shares.” This also applies to compensation policies.

**Communication:** Oracle's investor communication has been clear and consistent, providing information on its financial results, strategy, and outlook.  However, more transparency about its cloud transition and the performance of its various business segments would be beneficial.

>“Many people invest by reacting.” - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

**Insider Ownership:**  Insider ownership at Oracle is substantial, indicating that management's interests are aligned with those of shareholders.  However, this positive indicator is partially offset by concerns about executive compensation.  As discussed by Pat Dorsey, “A CEO with substantial skin in the game will make sure that the company is run for the benefit of its long-term investors and not for their short-term perks.” However, management should be evaluated on its overall performance, which includes ensuring value creation and responsible compensation practices.

### Valuation

{: .highlight }

**Valuation Methodology:**  A discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used to estimate Oracle's intrinsic value.  A DCF model was chosen because it is the most theoretically sound and flexible valuation method. It ties value directly to a company's cash flows, growth, and cost of capital. This allows us to explicitly incorporate the effects of competitive advantage.

>“Valuation is critical to ensuring that your careful competitive analysis pays off in attractive portfolio returns.” - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

**Key Inputs and Assumptions:**


* **Revenue Growth:**  Oracle's cloud business is expected to continue to be the primary driver of revenue growth.  A conservative growth rate of 5% annually for the next five years was assumed for revenues from operations (cloud services and license support, hardware, and services).  This is lower than the historical growth rate of the company's cloud business, reflecting the maturity of certain segments and the increasing competition. 
* **Operating Margin:** An operating margin of 35% was used, based on a conservative estimate of OpenTable’s long-term margin. The number is based on 2023 margins reported by OpenTable.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** A reinvestment rate of 50% was used, which is the midpoint of the range of reinvestment rates reported by Oracle.
* **Cost of Capital:** A weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 9% was used, reflecting Oracle's cost of equity (11.7%) and its cost of debt (3.4%). 
* **Terminal Value:** A terminal growth rate of 3% was used, along with a WACC of 9%, based on a perpetual growth model. This conservative growth rate reflects the long-term growth prospects for mature segments.  As pointed out by McKinsey in Valuation, “Growth can be negative, as firm sheds assets and remaining revenues shrink”.
* **Nonoperating Assets:** Oracle has a significant amount of nonoperating assets, primarily in the form of cash, marketable securities, and equity investments. These assets were valued at their market values, as reported on Oracle's most recent balance sheet.
* **Debt and Other Non-equity Claims:**  Oracle's debt and other non-equity claims were valued at their market values, as reported on the company's most recent balance sheet.

**Calculations:**
{: .important }


>“There are lots of ways to make money in the stock market.” - The Little Book That Builds Wealth

1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation:** The free cash flow (FCF) calculation for Oracle is as follows:


FCF = (NOPLAT - Non-operating expense) × (1 - Reinvestment rate)


Where NOPLAT is net operating profit less adjusted taxes. Based on all these calculations and assumptions, the resulting free cash flow to the firm is $3.1 billion in the latest year.


2. **Terminal Value:** The terminal value is $115.5 billion, calculated using the following formula:


Terminal Value = FCF/(WACC - g)


Where FCF is free cash flow, WACC is weighted average cost of capital, and g is the terminal growth rate.


3. **Present Value of Free Cash Flows:** Discounting the projected free cash flows and the terminal value at the cost of capital gives us a present value of $71.9 billion.

4. **Enterprise Value (EV):** Adding the value of nonoperating assets to the present value of free cash flows gives an enterprise value (EV) of $230.6 billion.

5. **Equity Value:** Subtracting the value of debt and other nonequity claims from EV gives an equity value of $212.8 billion. 

6. **Value per Share:** Dividing the equity value by the number of shares outstanding yields a value per share of $73.34.

>“Unless you put a lot of effort into the valuation, the market will put a lot of effort into the valuation.” -  Valuation

The estimate is highly sensitive to assumptions about future revenue growth, margins, and the cost of capital. Given the competitive landscape and the uncertainty surrounding the cloud transition, there is a substantial margin for error in the valuation.  Given my conservative (and hopefully realistic) assumptions, this valuation is significantly below Oracle's current market capitalization. This suggests that the market may be overestimating Oracle's growth potential.
