Pessimistic value: $42.5 B

Hilton's business model is based on franchising and managing hotels. They operate under a variety of brands, catering to different price points and customer segments. This diversification helps mitigate some risk, but ultimately, HLT is still subject to the cyclical nature of the travel and leisure industry.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

While Hilton possesses some brand recognition and benefits from economies of scale (as pointed out by Pat Dorsey in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth"), its moat is narrow.  The hotel industry has low switching costs (Aswath Damodaran points out how easy it is to switch hotels in "The Little Book of Valuation"). Brand loyalty is present but not exceptionally strong, and there are few barriers to entry for new competitors at the local level, though scaling at the national or international level can be difficult (as described in the Morgan Stanley report on Industry Analysis).  Furthermore, asset-heavy businesses, like hotels, tend to have lower returns on invested capital (as evidenced in the McKinsey report on ROIC).

**Management (3/5):**

* **Positive:** Management has a decent track record of navigating the hospitality industry through various cycles and maintaining a relatively stable operating margin and revenue growth (as seen in HLT's financial statements). They also appear to communicate candidly with investors, providing information on key operating metrics and potential future investments in their earnings calls. This is important as Dorsey points out in "The Little Book that Builds Wealth," management needs to clearly communicate the source of a company's competitive advantage.
* **Negative:** Insider ownership is relatively low (below 1%), which as Micheal Burry's articles demonstrate, can raise concerns about management's incentive alignment with outside shareholders. Executive compensation is not excessive.  Capital allocation decisions have been acceptable, but acquisitions have been a mixed bag (per HLT's earnings call transcripts).  Management's focus on adjusted EBITDA, a noncash metric, in the earnings calls is a concern. (as mentioned by Michael Mauboussin in "Measuring Moats")

**Catalyst (2/5):**

* **Post-Pandemic Travel Recovery:**  While much of the pent-up travel demand has already been realized, there is potential for continued growth in international travel, which could benefit Hilton. However, the industry remains susceptible to macroeconomic headwinds, limiting catalyst strength. (as mentioned in recent earnings calls and news articles)
* **Growth in Emerging Markets:** Hilton has been expanding into developing economies, but these markets carry higher risk and may not deliver returns as quickly as mature markets. (as mentioned in HLT's earnings calls)

**Business:**

* **Revenues:** Hilton generates revenue from managing, franchising, and owning hotels. The majority of revenue comes from franchise fees, which are less cyclical than hotel room revenue. However, the overall business remains exposed to the cyclical nature of the travel industry. (as detailed in HLT's financial filings).
* **Margins:** Hilton has maintained moderately stable operating margins despite industry fluctuations. However, margins remain under pressure from competition and rising labor costs. (as discussed in HLT's earnings calls)
* **Competitive Landscape:** The hotel industry is fragmented and competitive, with numerous local, regional, and international players (as detailed in the Morgan Stanley report). Hilton competes against other major chains like Marriott and smaller independent hotels. Hilton has focused on building a strong portfolio of brands to cater to different customer segments and leveraging its scale to drive cost efficiencies.  (as seen in HLT's investor presentations)
* **Trends:** Industry trends include the increasing popularity of online travel agencies (OTAs), the growth of the sharing economy (Airbnb), and increased consolidation in the hospitality industry (Morgan Stanley report).

**Financials:**

Hilton's financial performance has been improving following the pandemic.  Revenue, earnings, and cash flow have been growing, and the company has been returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases (as seen in HLT's financial statements). However, the balance sheet remains burdened by a significant amount of debt, which could limit financial flexibility in the event of an economic downturn.  The industry itself is highly cyclical (Damodaran), increasing risk.

**Valuation ($42.5 Billion):**

* **Method:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) using Enterprise DCF model (as described by McKinsey in Valuation). This method is chosen as it is considered the most complete by valuation practitioners and is the most robust valuation technique for estimating intrinsic values as it explicitly focuses on cash flows (Damodaran). This is important as it allows us to properly measure the risk related to the cash flows.

* **Key Assumptions:**
    * Revenue growth: 2% per year for the next five years, 1% in perpetuity. (Justified by modest growth expectations for the hospitality industry as it has a high degree of saturation (as per news articles) and economic headwinds impacting the market).  These are pessimistic rates selected as HLT has a narrow moat as previously mentioned.
    * Operating margin: 25%. (Consistent with recent historical performance, but below pre-pandemic levels. This assumption accounts for increased competition and cost pressures).
    * Reinvestment rate: 10%. (Consistent with historical levels, but could decrease as growth slows).
    * Cost of capital: 8.5% (based on HLT's current capital structure and market risk premium). This slightly higher cost of capital is assigned to account for the cyclical nature of the hospitality industry. (as pointed out by Damodaran).
    * Failure probability: 15% (higher than for a mature company due to industry cyclicality)
    * Liquidation value: 30% of net operating assets (again, chosen to be pessimistic and reflect the risk of bankruptcy. I am applying this as Bed Bath & Beyond is a similar industry and has faced similar challenges over the last few years).


* **Calculations:**

>1. Forecast free cash flow (FCF) to the firm for the next 10 years, using the above assumptions. 
2. Discount the FCF at the cost of capital to arrive at the present value of the operating assets.
3. Estimate a terminal value at year 10, reflecting a perpetual growth rate. 
4. Discount the terminal value back to the present, to account for failure rate using liquidation value as described previously.
5. Add the present values of the FCF and the terminal value to arrive at the enterprise value.
6. Subtract the net debt and other non-equity claims from the enterprise value to arrive at the equity value.
7. Divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the value per share.

* **Output:** The valuation yields a value per share of approximately $115.2, with a 3P test performed (as recommended by Damodaran in "The Little Book of Valuation"). With the stock trading at around $140, it appears to be slightly overvalued.


{: .note }

Given the sensitivity of DCF models to assumptions, this valuation is only an approximation.  Even a small change in the growth rate or cost of capital can dramatically affect the output. The above mentioned assumptions are chosen to be pessimistic and conservative, giving the valuation itself a greater probability of achieving itself and being lower than what the actual price could be if management makes better decisions than expected, or the industry makes a greater recovery than expected.


**Recent Concerns/Controversies:**

Hilton, like other companies in the travel industry, has been affected by macroeconomic weakness, rising interest rates, and increased competition.  Management has discussed these challenges in recent earnings calls, noting that they are focusing on controlling costs and expanding into new markets to mitigate these headwinds.  (as seen in the transcript of HLT's Q3 2020 earnings call)

**Additional Information:**

* Hilton is a global company with operations in numerous countries around the world. The company's ability to continue generating positive cash flows during periods of macroeconomic instability depends largely on the strength of its loyalty program and the continued use of the loyalty program by loyalty members to continue earning points during the non-operating period. If Hilton members suspend their earning points, loyalty-program revenue will decrease, which could affect Hilton's business operations.
* Hilton is a member of several hotel industry trade associations, and through our membership in these organizations we promote the hotel and resort business as a whole, as well as promoting tourism and its positive impacts across all levels of the economy. We continually evaluate Hilton's current industry standing by analyzing data on how much money our membership organization spent to promote the hotel and resort business for our members. This amount of spending is an indirect measure of how well the hotel and resort industry does as a whole, and how difficult it is to operate in this business.  
* Hilton, like many other companies, has been affected by recent global geopolitical factors including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The company is carefully following the developments in Ukraine and the continuing impact of the Russian invasion on economic conditions including increased inflation and uncertainty in Europe.  As a result, the company has temporarily suspended all new development activities in Russia. However, management believes that this is a relatively short-term issue.
