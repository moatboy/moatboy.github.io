ALL operates in a highly competitive insurance industry, with its largest segments being Property-Liability insurance (including auto, homeowners, and other personal lines) and Protection Services (including Allstate Protection Plans, Allstate Identity Protection, Allstate Roadside Services and health and benefits). It also has other lines of business, such as corporate, run-off property-liability, and discontinued operations.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.



**Moat (2/5)**

While ALL possesses some brand recognition and scale advantages, these are not sufficient to grant it a wide moat. As Pat Dorsey explains in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, true economic moats protect high returns on capital from competition for extended periods. ALL's brand, while recognizable, does not command significant pricing power, as consumers are highly price-sensitive in the insurance market and easily switch providers for lower rates. Scale advantages, while present in auto insurance due to ALL's extensive agent network, are less pronounced in other segments, and face increasing pressure from online and direct-to-consumer insurers. ALL's efforts to build a moat through customer loyalty programs and telematics solutions have yet to demonstrably translate into durable competitive advantages.



**Management (3/5)**

ALL's management receives a middling rating primarily due to past capital allocation decisions and its communication style. While the firm has a history of decent returns on equity and dividend payouts, management's penchant for share repurchases, particularly during periods of high valuation, is questionable. While buybacks can enhance shareholder value if executed at prices significantly below intrinsic value, they can destroy value if done at inflated prices.  ALL's emphasis on "Transformative Growth," while intended to accelerate long-term growth, seems to imply acquisitions as a major piece of this plan, which as discussed by Aswath Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*, is a highly challenging way to create value.

While management's rhetoric on acquisitions sounds appealing, their track record does not fully support their claims. Management has yet to demonstrate a strong track record of successfully integrating acquisitions, achieving projected synergies, and returning cash to shareholders.



ALL's management team and directors own less than 1% of outstanding shares, which based on Ken Fisher's explanation in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*, raises a red flag. Low levels of insider ownership may weaken management's incentive to act in the long-term interest of shareholders. Management's communication is often focused on short-term earnings and investor relations narratives, rather than offering substantial insights into the underlying business economics, long-term strategy, and capital allocation decisions, following a pattern described by Michael Mauboussin in his Morgan Stanley research report *Measuring the Moat*.


**Catalyst (2/5)**

While the ongoing shift towards digital distribution, usage-based insurance, and telematics could potentially boost profitability and customer engagement in the long run, there are no significant near-term catalysts expected to dramatically increase share prices. The competitive landscape remains intense, and the increasing adoption of telematics by other major competitors could erode any potential first-mover advantage for ALL.

While initiatives like Milewise show promise, their long-term success is uncertain, and competition remains fierce. The industry is currently undergoing what Bruce Greenwald would call, in *Competition Demystified*, a shake-out, as companies are scrambling to adapt to the changing marketplace.


**Business**

ALL's Property-Liability segment, comprising approximately 75% of its revenue, faces increasing competition from new entrants and online insurers, putting pressure on pricing. Its growth has largely stagnated, and it has resorted to share repurchases to prop up its EPS. Its Protection Services segment, which accounts for roughly 20% of revenue, is growing, but with low profit margins.

> As revealed in the Q2 2024 earnings call, Allstate Protection Plans saw a 15% YoY revenue increase but only a 3% growth in operating profit, which, relative to its reinvestment rate, doesn't seem like much of a return.

**Financials**

ALL’s financials reveal a company with mediocre ROIC and a substantial amount of goodwill on the balance sheet.  



> ALL’s consolidated financial statements, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, show a loss from operations of ($1.4 billion) - and a net loss attributable to Allstate of ($1.8 billion).

{: .warning }

Although the company is repurchasing its own shares (reducing its number of outstanding shares and increasing EPS), it seems that the company is being penalized by the market for losing money.

**Valuation ($31.5 Billion)**

To estimate ALL's value, a two-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model was used, with an explicit forecast period of 10 years and a terminal value beyond. Key inputs for the valuation are based on the company's historical performance, current financials, industry averages, and a pessimistic, though not unrealistic, outlook. It is worth nothing that financial documents used for this valuation are the latest publicly available, from 2018-2023.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:** 2% annually in first 5 years, 1% thereafter (declining market share, increased competition)
* **Operating Margin:** 15% in stable growth (industry average, acknowledging management's cost-cutting initiatives)
* **Reinvestment Rate:** 25% (reflecting the ongoing need for investment in technology and distribution)
* **Cost of Equity:** 9% (based on CAPM with a beta of 0.8 and a market risk premium of 4.5%)
* **Cost of Debt:** 4.5% (based on the company’s current bond yields)
* **Tax Rate:** 25% (US statutory corporate tax rate)

**Calculations:**


1. **Forecast Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):** Revenue projections are multiplied by operating margins to arrive at operating income. Taxes, net investment, and other adjustments (as provided in the latest ALL financial statements) are then factored in to arrive at FCFF for each year. 


2. **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity growth method.


3. **Present Value:**  The present values of the FCFF and terminal value are discounted back to the present using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The calculation of the WACC itself requires estimation using current capital structure.


4. **Value of Equity:**  The present value of the projected cash flows is the enterprise value. From this, the value of debt is subtracted to arrive at the value of equity.


5. **Value per Share:** The value of equity is divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at the value per share.

Based on these assumptions and calculations, the estimated value of ALL is approximately **$31.5 billion**, compared to about $40.6 billion by Yahoo Finance at the time of this analysis.  This suggests that the stock may be overvalued at its current price.


{: .note }

This valuation is sensitive to the key assumptions used, particularly revenue growth and margin. A more optimistic scenario, with higher revenue growth and margin improvement, could yield a higher valuation. Conversely, a more pessimistic scenario, with lower growth and margin compression, could yield a much lower valuation.
