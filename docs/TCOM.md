>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Analysis (2/5):**

Trip.com benefits from the network effect, as described in Pat Dorsey's "The Little Book That Builds Wealth."  A larger network of users makes the platform more valuable for both consumers and service providers. This is particularly strong in China due to the company's early mover advantage. However, the network effect is not as powerful as in other industries like software, where switching costs are far higher (as Dorsey points out). Trip.com faces increasing competition, especially from domestic players, which limits the durability of its network advantage. Its brand is well-known in China, which could be considered a small intangible asset moat.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

{: .important }

Trip.com's management has generally executed well, successfully navigating the company through several crises, including the SARS epidemic, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. They have demonstrated prudence by focusing on domestic travel during challenging periods. This is evident in the Q4 2020 earnings call, where management emphasized the resilience of domestic travel.
{: .important }


However, some concerns remain:

* **Capital allocation:**  While management has delivered growth, the company's historical acquisitions have not always been accretive.  The company sometimes overpaid for acquisitions, as seen with the S&N acquisition, which did not generate expected returns (Q1 2009 earnings call).
* **Communication:** While management is communicating with shareholders, and doing so with an increasingly optimistic outlook, they don't always provide details on a business unit level. This makes it harder for investors to fully understand the company's financials and operations, a point emphasized in the "Investor Communications" chapter of McKinsey's "Valuation."
* **Compensation:** Trip.com uses employee stock options and restricted share units, but these are not always tied to strong performance measures, something discussed in Warren Buffett's essays.
* **Insider Ownership:** While insider ownership is above zero, it's not high enough to fully align management's interests with those of outside shareholders.

**Business Overview:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** Trip.com generates revenue from four main segments: accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged tours, and corporate travel management. The largest segment is accommodation reservation, which includes hotels and other lodgings. Transportation ticketing is a close second, followed by packaged tours and then corporate travel.
* **Industry Trends:** The online travel industry in China is growing, but it is becoming increasingly competitive. This is mentioned in several of the company's earnings calls, including the Q4 2020 call, where management noted the increasing consolidation in the sector.
* **Margins:** Trip.com's margins have historically been healthy, generally higher than those of global peers. The company's margins have improved over time. This is visible in the financials.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The competitive landscape is fierce, with major international players and domestic Chinese companies all vying for market share.
* **Differentiating Factors:** Trip.com's wide range of products and services, its early mover advantage in the Chinese market, and its strong brand name are key differentiating factors.

**Financial Analysis:**

{: .highlight }

Trip.com's financials reveal a company that has delivered strong historical growth. Its revenue and earnings have increased over the years.  The financial crisis of 2008 and the pandemic in 2020 caused drops, but the company rebounded effectively.
{: .highlight }


However, recent years have seen more modest growth, and profitability has declined. Also, capital expenditures have risen, driving down free cash flow.

**Valuation (DCF Model - $28.1 Billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model is used to estimate Trip.com's intrinsic value.  A five-year explicit forecast period is used, followed by a continuing value. Key assumptions are as follows:

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on management's projections and industry trends, revenue growth is assumed to be 2% over the next five years.  This pessimistic outlook reflects the increased competition and maturing market.
* **Operating Margin:** A gradual improvement to 15% is assumed by year 5, reflecting management's goal.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  A reinvestment rate of 10% of after-tax operating income is assumed.
* **Cost of Capital:**  A cost of capital of 10% is used. This reflects the risks associated with investing in the Chinese online travel market. These calculations are in USD to reflect a global perspective. 
* **Terminal Value:** A terminal growth rate of 3% and a return on capital of 12% are assumed for the continuing value.

{: .note }

Applying these assumptions and discounting the projected cash flows and the terminal value at the cost of capital results in an enterprise value of $31.25 billion.  Subtracting net debt yields an equity value of $28.1 billion.
{: .note }


**Catalysts (3/5):**

* **Domestic Travel Recovery:** The continued rebound of domestic travel in China is a key catalyst.  As seen in recent earnings calls (Q4 2020, Q1 2021), domestic travel has shown strong resilience. This catalyst has partially materialized, but further recovery could boost the stock.
* **International Travel Reopening:** While the company is prudently focusing on domestic travel, a reopening of international travel could be a powerful catalyst. (Q1 2021)
* **Expansion into New Markets:** Trip.com is looking to expand into new markets, such as Southeast Asia. Successful expansion could drive further growth. (Q3 2020)


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

{: .warning }

Recent geopolitical tensions related to China and the US introduce some risk into the valuation. A material deterioration in the relationship between the PRC and U.S. or other western governments would likely have a material and adverse effect on Trip.com.  
{: .warning }


{: .warning }

Also, competition from other Chinese travel companies is escalating. (Q4 2020, Q1 2021). This increased competitive intensity must be monitored and factored into future valuation updates.
{: .warning }


These are the key concerns and problems currently faced by the company. It is essential to address these factors in future valuation updates, which can materially affect business performance and outcomes.
