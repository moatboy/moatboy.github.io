{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

MPLX exhibits some characteristics of a narrow moat, stemming from its network of pipelines and other midstream assets. These create switching costs for its customers and some economies of scale. However, the midstream sector overall faces increasing competitive pressures and the long-term contracts that MPLX relies on can be renegotiated, which reduces the durability of this moat. Further, the concentration of MPC as the majority owner and customer introduces some dependency risk.

**Management (3/5):**

* **History and Experience:** The management team demonstrates extensive experience in the midstream sector. However, their strategic decision-making could be better, as evidenced by their significant impairment charges in the recent past and continued reliance on a related party (MPC). The concentration of MPC as the main customer creates challenges in diversifying the business, which could become a long-term strategic problem.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is largely tied to earnings growth targets. Such target-driven incentives can encourage short-term decision-making at the expense of long-term value creation, particularly given the cyclical nature of the commodity businesses on which they depend.
* **Communication:** MPLX’s management communication style in earnings calls is often rather opaque. They focus on hitting near-term targets rather than providing candid, long-term outlooks for the firm, which could raise concerns for investors seeking long-term value.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** The recent sale of retail assets was financially sound but does not address the strategic problem of relying too heavily on MPC. Acquisitions may offer some upside. However, the company has also made some questionable decisions in the past, leading to large write-offs, which raises concerns about capital allocation discipline. It is also not clear whether MPC benefits from these acquisitions as much as it should.
* **Insider Ownership:** The low level of insider ownership gives pause as it could limit the incentive to maximize long-term shareholder value.


**Catalyst (2/5):**

Potential catalysts include:

* **Improved Industry Conditions:** An improvement in energy prices and demand could improve MPLX's profitability.
* **Further Acquisitions:** Further accretive acquisitions, diversifying away from MPC, could unlock shareholder value. 
* **Increased Distributions to Unitholders:**  As earnings stabilize and cash flows improve, increased distributions could attract income-seeking investors.

{: .note }

These catalysts are subject to considerable uncertainty given the macroeconomic and commodity pricing environment.

**Business Overview:**

MPLX operates in a commodity business at the mercy of the economic and commodity cycles. Its revenues are largely dependent on volumes shipped and processed for MPC, its parent company.

* **Revenues:**  MPLX's revenues are generated from its logistics and storage (L&S) segment and its gathering and processing (G&P) segment. In 2022, approximately 60% of MPLX's revenues came from L&S, and 40% came from G&P. Its main customer is Marathon Petroleum (MPC), which accounts for a substantial portion of its total revenue.
* **Trends in the Industry:** The midstream energy industry is mature but highly competitive. It faces significant pressure from environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns.
* **Margins:** Operating margins tend to be cyclical, primarily driven by commodity prices and capacity utilization. 
* **Competitive Landscape:** The competitive landscape is intense, with large integrated players like Enterprise Products Partners and Energy Transfer.
* **Differentiating Factors:** MPLX's main differentiating factor is its close relationship with MPC, which provides a steady stream of business. However, as noted earlier, this relationship also introduces some business concentration risk.

Recent business concerns raised in earning calls include ongoing legal proceedings related to pipeline easement and right-of-way issues. (Q1 2023 earnings call)

**Financials:**

MPLX’s financial statements demonstrate healthy revenues but relatively low profitability compared with its peers due to its exposure to the commodity price cycle and its dependence on MPC.

* **Revenues:** Although revenue has grown over the last five years, there have been some dips due to commodity price cycles and the macroeconomic environment, including the pandemic-related economic slowdown. This creates a high degree of risk for shareholders and investors.
* **Profitability:**  Returns on invested capital are generally lower than industry peers. This indicates that MPLX has not consistently been able to create much value.
* **Growth:** Historical growth rates have been healthy overall, largely driven by acquisitions. However, recent acquisitions have been less accretive than those in the previous years. Maintaining this growth trajectory appears quite challenging.
* **Capital Expenditures:**  MPLX has been significantly increasing its capital expenditure over the last few years. These growth-related expenditures and investments must be monitored carefully.
* **Debt:**  MPLX’s leverage levels are high and appear risky especially in the current uncertain macroeconomic climate.


**Valuation:**

I have used a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to estimate MPLX's intrinsic value. Here are my assumptions for a base-case valuation:

* **Revenue Growth Rate:** 3% for the next five years, then 2% in perpetuity. This assumption takes into account the recent slowdown in growth and projects only modest growth given its dependence on MPC and the cyclical nature of the industry.
* **Operating Margin:**  10% over the next ten years (based on the 2020-2023 margin trajectory and adjusted for the recent retail sale). This is a moderately optimistic assumption given industry pressures and past performance.
* **Tax Rate:** 25%.
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  40% declining gradually over time to 10%. This represents a high-risk, high-return investment profile.
* **Cost of Equity:**  12% (based on 4.5% Risk Free Rate and 7.5% Equity Risk Premium as shown in Valuation chapter section 4.5).
* **Cost of Debt:** 5.5% (based on 10-year US treasury yields plus a premium, as demonstrated in Valuation Chapter)
* **WACC:** 9.1%.
* **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2%.

Using these assumptions, my **DCF model yields an intrinsic value of $37.5 billion** as of September 30, 2023. This is approximately equal to MPLX's current market value. The margin of safety is almost nil. Given my pessimistic and skeptical outlook, I would not view MPLX as a buy at its current price.

The key valuation variables affecting MPLX's value are revenue growth, margin improvement, and capital expenditure discipline. The biggest risk comes from its exposure to the commodity price cycle and its heavy dependence on MPC.
