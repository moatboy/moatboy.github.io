Pessimistic value: $170 B

HSBC, one of the world's largest banking and financial services organizations, operates in a highly competitive environment.  While it benefits from economies of scale and a globally diversified business, these advantages are not enough to create a wide moat. Its performance has been uneven, and its ability to maintain profitability going forward is uncertain, given significant headwinds in key markets.

{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

HSBC's moat stems primarily from two sources:

1. **Scale:** As a large, global bank, HSBC benefits from economies of scale. This translates into lower operating costs relative to smaller competitors, particularly in areas like technology and regulatory compliance.  This allows HSBC to compete on price and still maintain decent margins. However, the benefits of scale are not unlimited and can sometimes create bureaucratic inefficiencies, as noted by McKinsey in *Valuation*.
2. **Brand Name:** HSBC has built a strong brand name, particularly in Asia, giving it an edge in attracting and retaining customers. However, as Damodaran points out in *The Little Book of Valuation*, brand names in banking are more about stability and trust than pricing power. This limits their moat-building potential.

{: .warning }

HSBC's size and brand can make it difficult for new entrants, but they don't provide an insurmountable barrier to entry. Other established players, fintech disruptors, and even large tech companies are all vying for market share, making the competitive landscape increasingly challenging.  Additionally, regulations, economic downturns, and changing customer preferences pose an ongoing threat to its business.  As Dorsey notes in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, competitive advantages are not static, and moats can erode over time.
.

**Management (2/5):**

HSBC's management receives a rating of 2/5, reflecting a mixed record in performance, capital allocation, and shareholder communication.

* **History and Experience:**  HSBC has cycled through several CEOs in the last few years, suggesting instability at the top.  While the current CEO, Noel Quinn, has been with the company since 1987 (HSBC 2021 earnings call), his tenure as CEO has been marked by mixed results.
* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** HSBC has made significant investments in growth markets, particularly in Asia.  However, the returns on these investments have not been consistently high, and the recent economic slowdown in Asia has created significant headwinds.  As highlighted in *Valuation*, the more money a company makes, the more pressure it has to find new uses for its cash, and often management makes large, value-destroying investments or acquisitions.
* **Communication:**  While HSBC provides detailed financial data in its annual reports, its communication concerning its long-term strategy and competitive advantages could be clearer.  As noted in *Valuation*, communicating with financial markets requires transparency about results and future prospects.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is substantial, but its linkage to value creation for shareholders requires closer scrutiny. It is not clear whether HSBC's executive compensation is aligned with long-term value creation.  
* **Insider Ownership:**  Share ownership by management is limited. The absence of a large stake reduces the alignment between managers and shareholders.

{: .note }

Overall, HSBC's management is experienced but has not delivered exceptional results, and its capital allocation decisions have not always created substantial value for shareholders. The frequent turnover at the CEO position is also a concern.  These factors suggest that it is critical to review management closely.
.

**Business:**

* **Revenues Distribution:** HSBC is globally diversified, with its largest market being Asia. Its revenues come from four main segments: Wealth and Personal Banking, Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets, and Corporate Centre.  Within each segment, it provides a wide range of financial services, from retail banking and insurance to investment banking and wealth management. (HSBC 2023 Annual report)
* **Industry Trends:**  The banking industry is facing numerous challenges, including competition from fintech companies, increasing regulatory pressures, and a difficult macroeconomic environment.  Specifically, high inflation and interest rate increases create a risk of reduced revenue, increased loan losses, and reduced economic activity. (HSBC 2023 earnings call Q1)
* **Margins:** Margins in banking tend to be thin, and HSBC is no exception.  The company's profitability has been under pressure in recent years, and its ability to maintain decent margins in the future is uncertain.
* **Competitive Landscape:** The banking industry is highly competitive, with numerous global and regional players. HSBC's key competitors include JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and other large banks. (HSBC 2023 Annual report)
* **Differentiation:**  HSBC seeks to differentiate itself through its global reach and focus on emerging markets. However, these advantages are being challenged by competitors who are also expanding their global reach. (HSBC 2023 earnings call Q2)

**Financials (in-depth analysis):**

HSBC's financial performance has been mixed. Its return on equity and its return on tangible equity have been below the cost of capital for the last five years. Growth has been driven primarily by acquisitions, not organic growth.  As pointed out in *Valuation*, acquisitions are not always value-creating and can actually destroy value if not implemented correctly.

**Valuation ($170 billion):**

{: .important }

To value HSBC, a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is employed. The DCF model calculates intrinsic value as the present value of future cash flows to the firm, adjusted for failure probabilities and discounted at the company's cost of capital. Given the current macroeconomic and market environment, conservative assumptions are used.  

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Moderate revenue growth of 3 percent a year is assumed for the next 10 years, declining to 2 percent thereafter. This aligns with the company's long-term strategy as discussed by its group chief executive in the 2023 earnings call Q1.
* **Margins:**  Operating margins are assumed to be stable at their current levels (HSBC 2023 Q3 Earnings Call).
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  A reinvestment rate of 10 percent is assumed, reflecting its ongoing investments in technology and growth markets. The reinvestment rate is derived using the projected growth and return on capital assumptions and the reinvestment relationship from *Valuation*.
* **Cost of Capital:**  A cost of capital of 7 percent is assumed, reflecting the risk-free rate, equity risk premium, and beta of comparable companies, as discussed in the *Valuation* text.
* **Probability of Failure:** A 10 percent probability of failure is assumed for a 10 year period based on its bond rating and historical default rates from *Valuation*, with the assumption that the distressed sales price of assets will be 50% of their current value.

**Calculations:**

1. **Projected Cash Flows:**  Free cash flows are projected based on revenue growth, margin, and reinvestment assumptions using the methodology detailed in the *Valuation* text.
2. **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value is estimated using a perpetuity growth model, assuming a perpetual growth rate of 2% and a cost of capital of 7%.
3. **Present Value:**  The present values of projected free cash flows and the terminal value are calculated using the cost of capital.
4. **Distress Probability Adjustment:** Value of firm and Value per Share are adjusted for the distress probability, as highlighted in *Valuation*. 

{: .note }

The resulting DCF valuation is $170 billion.  This valuation assumes stable growth and margins and is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Furthermore, this valuation is based on accounting financial data, which should not be taken as an accurate representation of future economic performance.
.

**Catalysts (1/5):**

{: .note }

HSBC does not have strong upcoming catalysts. It's restructuring efforts are ongoing, and success is not guaranteed. A pickup in growth in Asia and stable margins would be positive developments, but these are not certain.
.

* **Restructuring:** HSBC is in the midst of a major restructuring program, shifting its focus to Asia and exiting less profitable markets.  The success of this restructuring could boost its profitability and unlock value, but as highlighted in *Valuation*, restructuring is often easier said than done.  Execution risk is high. (HSBC 2023 Earnings release Q4)
* **Asia Growth:**  A resurgence in economic growth in Asia, HSBC's largest market, could accelerate its revenue and earnings growth.  However, current economic headwinds in China pose challenges in the short-term.  (HSBC 2023 earnings call Q1)

**Recent Concerns/Controversies/Problems:**

* **Geopolitical Risks:** HSBC faces geopolitical risks from its operations in diverse regions, including rising tensions between China and the West, political instability, and regulatory pressures.  (HSBC 2023 Annual report)
* **Regulatory Scrutiny:**  HSBC has been under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years, facing fines and penalties for past compliance failures and business practices. (HSBC 2022 Annual report)  This has led to substantial costs and reputational damage.  
* **Activist Investors:**  HSBC has faced pressure from activist investors calling for a breakup of the company and increased shareholder returns. (Ping An's proposal to spin off Asian Business, Financial Times, March 13, 2023) Management has resisted these calls so far, but the pressure remains.

{: .note }

Overall, HSBC is a large, globally diversified bank with a modest moat, mixed management, and no strong upcoming catalysts. Given the uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and the ongoing challenges to its core businesses, a cautious, value-driven approach to its shares is warranted.  The valuation of $170 billion, while above the current market price, incorporates substantial margin of safety and accounts for the uncertainties around the company's future.
