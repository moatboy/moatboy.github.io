## HSBC Holdings plc (HSBC) | Moat: 2 / 5 | Valuation: $120 Billion

HSBC Holdings plc is a global banking and financial services company headquartered in London, U.K. The company operates through four main business segments:

* **Wealth and Personal Banking:** This segment provides retail banking, wealth management, insurance, and asset management services to individuals and small businesses.
* **Commercial Banking:** This segment provides banking services to small, medium, and large corporations, as well as financial institutions.
* **Global Banking and Markets:** This segment provides investment banking, sales, trading, and research services to large corporations, financial institutions, and governments.
* **Corporate Centre:** This segment includes the treasury function of the bank, as well as its capital planning and deployment activities.

**Moat Analysis**

HSBC's moat rating is 2 out of 5, indicating a narrow moat. While HSBC possesses some competitive advantages, there are significant weaknesses that constrain the width of its moat.

**Sources of Competitive Advantage:**

* **Brand Name:** HSBC is a globally recognized brand, which provides it with some pricing power in certain markets, specifically in Asia and some parts of Europe, where it has a strong legacy presence. However, this brand power is limited in other markets where other large banks have greater consumer affinity.
* **Switching Costs:** Although HSBC has some customer captivity, especially in some areas of Asia, the barriers to changing banks or financial advisors are not high enough to dig a significant moat. The switching costs are not so high that they would prevent customers from leaving if they perceived better offers from competitors. Moreover, the increasing digitalization of banking services has reduced switching costs for customers.
* **Economies of Scale:** HSBC benefits from economies of scale, particularly in its global banking and markets business, where large trading volumes and global reach are essential. This advantage is weakened by the trend of de-globalization and increased competition from smaller, agile financial institutions.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Intangible Assets:** The bank's brand value, although a source of some competitive advantage, is not durable enough to create a wide moat. Brand recognition alone doesn't necessarily translate into higher profits.
* **Eroding Moat:** HSBC's historical performance in terms of return on invested capital has been inconsistent. The bank has struggled to maintain high returns in a highly competitive environment. Moreover, the rise of fintech companies is increasing competitive pressure on traditional banking services.
* **Management:** While current management may be perceived as above average or even good, the impact of management is less significant than company economics or structural advantages, particularly for a very large business like HSBC.

**Moat Rating Justification:**

HSBC's narrow moat rating of 2 out of 5 reflects its somewhat recognized brand name and economies of scale. However, its moat is constrained by intense competition, its eroding returns, and rising fintech competition.

**Valuation**

Based on an analysis of HSBC's financials and business model, we estimate a fair value of $120 billion, using a conservative discounted cash flow (DCF) model. This valuation reflects a pessimistic perspective on the bank's future growth and profitability.

**Key Assumptions:**

* **Revenue growth:** Assuming 3% growth in revenues until 2028, subsequently declining gradually to 2% in perpetuity. This estimate reflects the mature stage of the industry and HSBC's challenges in finding new growth levers.
* **Margins:** We have assumed stable operating margins at 21% and net margin at 10% in perpetuity after the explicit forecast period. This estimate is below the pre-pandemic levels to reflect the increasingly competitive banking market and a slow macro environment.
* **Reinvestment rate:** Assuming 10% for the next 5 years and gradually tapering down to 5% over 30 years. Given mature businesses, HSBC will not need to reinvest as much of its earnings into growth.
* **Cost of equity:** The risk-free rate is taken from UK 10-year Govt bonds of 4%, a country equity risk premium for UK of 5.5%, and a beta for HSBC of 1, we estimate the cost of equity to be 9.5% during the next 5 years and 7.5% for the long term.
* **Tax rate:** HSBC's effective tax rate of 27% is incorporated.
* **Probability of failure:** A probability of failure of 1% is assumed, considering the bankâ€™s systemic importance and implicit government backing. 
* **Terminal growth:** Growth rate after year 10 of 2%.


**Discounted Cash Flow Valuation:**

The value of operating assets was estimated using the DCF method which involved:

1. Forecasting free cash flows over the next 10 years using the revenue and margin assumptions, applying a conservative reinvestment rate of 10% over the period.
2. Calculating the terminal value using the perpetuity growth method.
3. Discounting the explicit-period cash flows and the terminal value at the cost of capital.
4. Summing the present values to get the value of the business, and adding the cash balance, while subtracting out the book value of debt.
5. Dividing by the total number of shares to get a per-share value.


**Sensitivity Analysis and Scenario Planning:**

To assess the impact of uncertainties on valuation, we constructed two additional scenarios besides the business-as-usual case.

* **Negative scenario:** This scenario assumes lower revenue growth, margin compression, and a higher risk premium, reflecting the impacts of a more severe and long-lasting global recession.
* **Positive scenario:** This scenario assumes higher revenue growth, margin expansion, and a lower risk premium, reflecting a sustained economic recovery and HSBC's successful implementation of its strategic plans.

The range of valuations across these scenarios highlights the significant impact of macroeconomic and company-specific uncertainties on HSBC's value.

**Conclusion:**

HSBC Holdings is a global bank with a narrow moat. Given its size and complexity, along with the ongoing challenges in the banking sector, a conservative valuation approach is appropriate.  Our valuation of $120 billion is based upon a conservative set of assumptions and reflects the inherent uncertainty in predicting the future.  It is worth noting that our estimates should be reviewed regularly because the actual performance of the company could be dramatically different from our projected performance.  This is especially the case for certain line items.  Changes in management expectations and reactions from competitors should be monitored.
