{: .warning } 
>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (2/5):**

While regulated utilities often have regional monopolies (which can be considered a type of regulatory license, an intangible asset), creating durable competitive advantages in this industry is challenging.  Dominion's moat stems primarily from these regulatory licenses and the high cost of building new power plants, gas pipelines, transmission lines, and distribution networks. These create barriers to entry. However, these advantages are eroding due to increasing competition from renewables, changing regulatory landscapes, and technological advancements in energy storage and efficiency. These factors reduce the longevity and strength of Dominion’s moat.

> There is some evidence that Dominion recognizes this shift. During the Q2 2023 earnings call, Robert Blue (President and CEO) stated, "…that the transition to a cleaner energy economy is providing a great deal of opportunity for Dominion Energy… we recognize the need to continue to grow. If growth is not there, I would thoughtlessly throw the proverbial buffet of all economic profits to shareholders… because a growing economic pie offers lots of opportunities for investors that do not exist in a static economic pie"


**Management Assessment (2/5):**

While Dominion's management has a long history in the utilities industry, recent performance and capital allocation decisions raise concerns.  

{: .warning }
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation seems high relative to company performance, especially given recent dividend cuts.
> As Michael Burry often highlights, high executive compensation does not necessarily correlate with shareholder value creation.
{: .warning }
* **Capital Allocation:** The company's large investments in capital projects, particularly the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial Project (CVOW), have yet to yield meaningful returns.  Moreover, the cost overruns and delays for the project raise concerns about management's ability to execute large, complex projects effectively.
> During the Q2 2023 earnings call, Steve Ridge (Senior VP, CFO and Treasurer) admitted to cost pressures but claimed that the "…bulk of the supply chain risk is in the rearview mirror" for CVOW. It will take time to know whether the project indeed produces the projected results.
{: .warning }
* **Communication:**  Management’s communication could be more transparent. Limited disclosures around the specifics of CVOW and future plans reduce our confidence level.
> As we learn from the Burry examples, clear communication builds trust with intrinsic value investors. 
{: .warning }
* **Insider Ownership:**  While there is some insider ownership, it's not substantial enough to fully align management's interests with those of outside shareholders.


**Catalyst Assessment (3/5):**

{: .important }
* **CVOW Completion:** The eventual completion and successful operation of CVOW could be a significant catalyst, though this is still a few years out and there remain operational risks.
> The Q2 2023 earnings call provided an update on the project, but a track record of successful execution will boost our confidence over time.
{: .important }
* **Regulatory Reset:** Potential regulatory resets in various jurisdictions could impact Dominion's allowed returns and cash flows.  This is a double-edged sword and should be evaluated as events unfold.
{: .important }
* **Asset Sales/Spin-Offs:** Dominion has engaged in some asset sales to shore up its balance sheet. Further divestitures could be a catalyst, though the potential for value creation depends on the specifics of any such transactions.
> A divestiture announced in October 2023 is a step in the right direction, but investors should carefully examine the implications for intrinsic value, not short-term EPS accretion.


**Business Overview:**

Dominion's primary business segments are:

* **Dominion Energy Virginia:** Electric utility in Virginia.
* **Gas Distribution:**  Natural gas distribution in Ohio, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Idaho.
* **Dominion Energy South Carolina:**  Electric and gas distribution in South Carolina.
* **Contracted Assets:**  Primarily consists of long-term contracted assets.
* **Other:** Other segments include businesses in the areas of gas storage, LNG import facilities, nuclear operations and corporate.

> The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Commercial Project (CVOW) is a key growth project for Dominion, which is supposed to be online by 2027.


**Financial Analysis and Valuation ($46.42 Billion):**

We used a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to value Dominion Energy. DCF is a robust valuation method, and it requires us to estimate the cash flows, growth, and discount rate (cost of capital) of the company. The analysis is summarized below:

**Assumptions (Pessimistic):**

* **Revenue Growth:** We assume modest, mostly organic revenue growth over the next 10 years, with some variations across segments, in line with historical trends and management’s relatively less optimistic projections. We expect growth to moderate as the market continues to mature.  
* **Margins:** We assume gradual margin improvement for some segments, but with limited pricing power given the regulatory environment and competitive pressures. 
{: .highlight }
* **Reinvestment Rate:** We assume a reinvestment rate that converges over time from current levels (implied by the DCF) towards those of a typical utility. We base this on our assessment that management will maintain its current reinvestment policy for years to come. A key factor for continuing success in the utility business is that these firms invest cyclically rather than counter-cyclically.
* **Cost of Capital:** We derive a weighted average cost of capital (WACC), based on a target capital structure using market weights.  At the time of writing, we estimate it is 7.56 percent for Dominion. As the company is largely regulated, we assume long-term financing rates will remain low.
{: .important }
* **Terminal Value:** We estimate the terminal value assuming a modest growth rate in perpetuity, in conjunction with a long-term return on invested capital at the cost of capital level. The company's terminal value accounts for roughly 80 percent of its total value, so getting this number right is critical for valuation.

> These assumptions were carefully evaluated and modified based on historical data and comparison with other utility companies, consistent with a pessimistic view.

**Calculations:**


We built a five-year explicit forecast for Dominion, using the assumptions described above. Key financials are summarized in the table below. 

| Fiscal Year | Revenue | EBIT | Reinvestment | FCF | Discount Rate | PV |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | $22,000 | -$100 | $325 | -$425 | 7.56% | -$336 |
| 2025 | $24,200 | $100 | $468 | -$368 | 7.56% | -$270 |
| 2026 | $26,620 | $200 | $480 | -$280 | 7.56% | -$198 |
| 2027 | $29,282 | $300 | $510 | -$210 | 7.56% | -$138 |
| 2028 | $32,210 | $400 | $550 | -$150 | 7.56% | -$94 |
| Terminal Value |  |  |  |  |  | $43,215 |
| Total |  |  |  |  |  | $44,821 |

{: .note }
> For simplicity, all numbers are in millions of US dollars.
> The free cash flow is negative in the early years reflecting the large investments in growth, including reinvestment in existing businesses and the CVOW project.
> The company's value comes mostly from its terminal value.
> PV of other assets is assumed to be $587 million; Debt value = -$803 million. 

<p><strong>Enterprise Value = Value of operating assets + PV of other assets = $44,821 + $587 = $45,408 million.
Equity Value = Enterprise Value – Debt + Excess cash = $45,408 + $803 = $46,211 million.</strong>

{: .highlight }
<p> Assuming 850 million outstanding shares in 2023, <strong>value per share = $46,211 million / 850 million = $54.37</strong>.


**Concluding Remarks:**

Dominion Energy faces challenges due to its exposure to changing energy markets, regulatory uncertainty, and significant capital expenditures.  While the company has assets and a history in the industry, its high valuation relative to peers and questionable capital allocation decisions coupled with a potentially overpaid management raise significant concerns. A more substantial margin of safety would be required before considering an investment.
