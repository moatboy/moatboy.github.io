>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat Assessment (3/5):**

Northrop Grumman operates in a highly regulated industry with significant barriers to entry, primarily due to stringent government contracting requirements and the need for specialized expertise and security clearances. These factors contribute to a narrow moat.  However, competition from other large defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and General Dynamics limits the moat's width. Further, technological advancements can sometimes quickly erode competitive advantages in the defense sector, demanding constant innovation and adaptation.  As Dorsey mentions in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, relying on regulations and contracts is nice but the regulatory landscape can change, rendering previous protections moot. It can be a slippery slope to rely on intangible assets for a moat.

**Management Assessment (3/5):**

While Northrop Grumman's management team appears competent, they do not exhibit the exceptional capital allocation skills or shareholder-friendly philosophy seen in truly outstanding companies, as emphasized by Buffett in *The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America*. Return on invested capital (ROIC), a key metric for profitability, has been hovering around cost of capital. Its recent strategic acquisition of Orbital ATK appears promising but the ultimate outcome still needs to play out fully.  There are a few potential concerns: 

* **Capital Allocation:** While recent acquisitions have been made, it is too early to judge the success of these acquisitions and whether they will create lasting value. The company seems to primarily focus on acquisitions as growth drivers, which is a risky strategy and indicates that they may struggle to generate growth organically. Further, as pointed out by McKinsey & Company in *Valuation*, the acquiring company shareholders typically earn less when acquisitions are made with stock.
* **Compensation:**  Executive compensation is largely tied to company performance, but details are not readily available to ascertain whether incentives are appropriately structured to encourage long-term value creation and discourage short-term manipulations, as highlighted by Buffett.
* **Communication:** Investor relations materials, while comprehensive, could benefit from increased transparency and a greater emphasis on communicating the company's intrinsic value to shareholders, as emphasized by Dorsey.
* **Insider Ownership:**  Data on insider ownership was not readily available to determine the alignment between the managers' and owners' interests.
* **History:**  Northrop Grumman has faced controversies in the past. For instance, Northrop received criticism for supply chain delays related to the James Webb Space Telescope, according to SpaceNews.com and Space.com. While such events don't necessarily reflect mismanagement, they can increase project costs and timing risks.

**Catalyst Assessment (2/5):**

* **Acquisitions and Integration:**  Successful integration of recent acquisitions and realization of projected synergies could lead to improved profitability and growth, which may drive share price appreciation.
* **New Product and Service Offerings:**  The defense sector is characterized by continuous innovation. New product launches could provide a boost to revenue growth in the short term if they're successful.
* **Government Spending Increases:**  Increased government spending on defense, driven by geopolitical uncertainties, could be a significant tailwind for Northrop Grumman's revenues, creating a positive feedback loop.

**Business Overview:**

Northrop Grumman operates through four business segments: Aeronautics Systems (31% of 2022 revenue), Defense Systems (28%), Mission Systems (26%), and Space Systems (15%).  The company derives more than half its revenue from U.S. government contracts. 

* **Industry Trends:**  The defense industry is consolidating, with the largest players acquiring smaller competitors to gain scale and broader capabilities. Technological disruption is also a key factor, with increased focus on autonomous systems, cyber, and space. The industry is also heavily influenced by geopolitical developments.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Northrop Grumman faces intense competition from other major defense contractors, particularly for large government contracts.  Pricing pressure can be intense, and differentiation often comes down to technological innovation and program execution, as emphasized in *Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance* by Michael Porter.
* **Margins:** Margins in the defense industry are generally stable, but can vary depending on the size and type of contract, and the stage of the product life cycle. Profit margins can be higher for differentiated products and lower for commodity products, as mentioned in *Valuation* by McKinsey & Company. As we learned in Q1 2023 earning call, there is a decline in margins in the IT services due to cost overruns on fixed-price development contracts. However, as mentioned in Q1 2023 earning call, the management expects margin recovery in this business by mid-2024. 
* **Financials:** The company has a market capitalization of about $72 billion, annual revenue of around $36 billion and net income over $3 billion. ROIC is around cost of capital, while the long-term growth rate has been around 3 percent a year (trailing three-year average) but it was as high as 7 percent per year for several years during the mid-2000s.

**Valuation ($63 Billion):**

A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model was used to estimate Northrop Grumman's intrinsic value. The details of the financial analysis were extracted from the company's 10-K filings for the years 2019 through 2022, augmented with data on share price and quarterly reporting from Yahoo Finance, and adjusted for the S&P 500 Index. 


**Key Assumptions:**

{: .highlight }
* **Revenue Growth:**  A 3 percent annual growth rate for the next five years, decreasing to 2 percent over the next five years, and then equal to the nominal growth rate of the economy in perpetuity (estimated at 3.5 percent)  The current three year average organic growth rate is at 3.3 percent.
* **Margins:** Pre-tax operating margins at 10 percent in perpetuity.
* **Reinvestment:**  Reinvestment at 10 percent in perpetuity.
* **Cost of Capital:**  7.5 percent. This is based on a risk-free rate of 3.5% (10-year U.S. Treasury bond rate), a market risk premium of 4%, a beta of 0.8, and a marginal tax rate of 20%.
* **Probability of Financial Distress:**  Low.

**Calculations:**

{: .important }
I employed a 10-year explicit forecast period, with a terminal value computed at the end of year 10. This assumes a long-term growth rate of 3.5% a year (the approximate long-run nominal growth rate of the U.S. economy), and a return on capital of 11.5% in perpetuity (slightly lower than the company's historical ROIC) . Based on these estimates, I arrived at an equity value per share of around $520 as follows:
1. Project revenues, EBIT and free cash flow for the explicit forecast period. The financials are derived using 10Ks and filings found on Edgar.
2. Compute the continuing value based on the steady-state long-term growth rate of 3.5 percent and the return on capital.  
3. Discount the cash flows and terminal value to arrive at present value for the operating assets (i.e., the operating business).
4.  Add the value of nonoperating assets (e.g., cash and investments)
5.  Subtract the market value of financial obligations (e.g., debt)
6.  Divide by the number of fully diluted shares to get the value per share.
The resulting value is $520 per share, or an equity value of $63 Billion.


**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

* **Supply Chain Issues:**  As mentioned in Q2 2023 earnings call, the sector as a whole has faced supply chain challenges, but these pressures have eased somewhat.  A focus area for management and investors is ensuring the resilience and diversity of the supply chain to mitigate future disruptions. 
* **Inflation and Cost Overruns:** As discussed in Q3 2023 earning call, inflation and rising costs have added to program costs for both current and new contracts, impacting margins.

**Conclusion:**

Northrop Grumman is a stable company with a narrow moat operating in a cyclical industry whose primary customer is the U.S. government. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine, discussed in Q1 2024 call, along with rising geopolitical tensions, may lead to increased defense budgets among countries friendly with the U.S. - benefiting Northrop Grumman. While the current valuation appears somewhat expensive relative to peers, using more pessimistic valuation estimates leads to the company's intrinsic value being in line with current market value. Northrop Grumman's status as a primarily U.S. government contractor, however, makes it more susceptible to U.S. political and budgetary policy risk than its global peers. Given the nature of its business and products, it also faces regulatory uncertainty and the risk of program cancellations, which could significantly affect its long-term growth. These are the important issues that need to be included in a valuation. Overall, a conservative investor should carefully consider these risks before investing in Northrop Grumman.
