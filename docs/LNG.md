>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (2/5):**

Cheniere benefits from a narrow moat stemming from its first-mover advantage in U.S. LNG exports and the high costs associated with building LNG liquefaction facilities. These create a barrier to entry. However, the moat is not exceptionally wide given:

* **Increasing competition:**  As more LNG export terminals come online in the U.S., Cheniere faces greater competition, which could compress margins in the long term. As noted in the Morgan Stanley report *Industry Analysis - Lay of the Land*, more supply leads to lower profitability.  The company's terminals are also primarily contracted to one customer, as revealed in the 10-K, although that is set to change as the industry develops. This concentration increases risk.
* **Regulation:** The LNG industry is heavily regulated, limiting Cheniere's pricing power and flexibility. For instance, Cheniere’s Sabine Pass LNG terminal is subject to the Natural Gas Act and the company is subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requirements. This also serves as a barrier to entry, since the process of obtaining all the required permits and approvals can be lengthy and complex, which is noted in Cheniere's 10-K filings.

**Management (3/5):**

* **Capital Allocation Decisions:** Cheniere's management has generally allocated capital toward expanding capacity, as seen in the company's recent 10-Ks, which aligns with shareholder interests in a growing industry.  However, the large capital expenditures have led to high debt levels, which could become problematic if LNG prices decline. The significant debt levels are disclosed in 10-K.
* **Compensation:**  Management compensation, consisting of base salary, annual incentive awards, performance-based restricted stock units, and other long-term incentive awards, seems aligned with shareholders, as there is a mix of cash compensation and long-term incentives. A more detailed breakdown of executive compensation can be accessed in the company’s proxy statements. Further, Jack Fusco, CEO since 2016, does not seem to own much stock.
* **Communication:**  Management seems reasonably transparent in earnings calls. For instance, Anatol Feygin, EVP and CFO, acknowledged the impact of changing global macroeconomic conditions on Cheniere’s business during the Q2 2023 earnings call. However, investor relations could provide more information about individual operating segments.
* **Overall:** Management appears competent, but the company's high debt load and concentration of customers are potential weaknesses. There is also no obvious indicator of exceptional management, and executive shareholdings could be higher.

**Catalyst (3/5):**

* **Global LNG Demand Growth:** Increasing demand for LNG, especially in Europe and Asia as mentioned in Cheniere’s SEC filings, could drive increased utilization of Cheniere's facilities.  However, new supply coming online may limit price increases.
* **Corpus Christi Stage 3 Expansion:**  The Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion will increase Cheniere’s export capacity as mentioned in various filings, though as per Morgan Stanley’s *Valuation of Young Firms*, the growth could potentially destroy value if it isn’t done efficiently. Moreover, as per the Q2 2023 earnings call, Train 3 is approximately 90% complete, making it a near-term catalyst.
* **Long-Term Contracts:**  Cheniere’s long-term contracts provide revenue visibility, but these contracts' limited link to spot prices reduces potential upside from rising LNG prices.  
* **Overall:** While long-term catalysts exist, potential competition and current high capital expenditures raise concerns.

**Valuation ($20.6 billion):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using the enterprise DCF approach (recommended in McKinsey’s *Valuation*) was employed. This approach is preferred because it is theoretically sound and ties to economic reality as discussed by Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*.

* **Forecast Period:** 10 years, as recommended by Damodaran in *The Little Book of Valuation*.
{: .note }
* **Revenue Growth:** As per the Q2 2023 earnings call, despite ongoing growth in its core markets, LNG has recently experienced some slowdown due to the reopening of previously shuttered LNG capacity in Japan.  Based on Cheniere's previous revenue growth and analyst estimates, we assume revenues of $25 billion in 2024, followed by 5% annual growth for the remaining years of the forecast period. As revenue growth exceeds the economy, we assume growth will decline gradually in the terminal period.
    Given Cheniere's high debt load, a conservative estimate is warranted. The company itself acknowledges it faces cyclical risks as mentioned in its earnings calls and SEC filings. I am also skeptical of management’s forecast for long-term volume growth. Thus, this assumption takes a very conservative view of future business development.
{: .note }
* **Operating Margin:**  Given the increasing competition, we forecast pretax operating margins to remain stable at approximately 15.5 percent, which is lower than the current margin. This conservative assumption reflects potential pricing pressure.
    As noted in McKinsey's *Valuation*, there is an inverse relationship between ROIC and margins. Higher returns attract competition, eroding returns. 
{: .note }
* **Reinvestment Rate:**  As per its SEC filings, Cheniere expects to generate cash flow over the next few years. Thus, we assume a reinvestment rate of 10%, assuming earnings are reinvested profitably in line with the company's historical reinvestment pattern.
    This reinvestment rate is used to sustain growth over the explicit forecast period. However, as per *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*, growth in stable economies cannot exceed GDP growth. We assume long-run growth, therefore, of 2%.
* **Cost of Capital:** Based on current market values, Cheniere has a capital structure of 44 percent debt and 56 percent equity. An unlevered beta of 0.73 (reflecting the risk of a commodity-based business as per Burry’s Journal) was adjusted for the target capital structure (40 percent debt), giving a levered beta of 1.0. Combined with a risk-free rate of 4% and market risk premium of 5%, the cost of equity is estimated at 9% (4% + 1 * 5%). The cost of debt is estimated at 6.5%, given Cheniere’s bond rating and corresponding spread over the treasury yield. This yields a weighted average cost of capital of 7.5% (0.40 * 6.5% * (1 – 0.25) + 0.60 * 9%)
{: .note }
* **Terminal Value:**  Given the maturity of the LNG market in the United States, I use a terminal growth rate of 2% and stable return on capital of 10%, in line with estimates for other mature businesses. The resulting terminal value is $49.316 billion.
    There are other approaches to determine terminal value, but since the company has a long life ahead of it, a conservative perpetuity-based calculation of the terminal value is the most robust as discussed by Damodaran. 
* **Value of Operating Assets:** Discounting the terminal value and explicit free cash flows by the cost of capital yields a present value of operating assets of $22.376 billion.  
{: .note }
* **Nonoperating Assets:** Cheniere has excess cash on the balance sheet, which, as per McKinsey’s *Valuation*, adds to the operating asset value. Valuing cash at book value of $1.04 billion and subtracting the present value of existing debt and outstanding shares (both figures taken from its SEC filings) yields a value of $20.6 billion.
    This calculation assumes the conversion of management stock options and that shareholders will be diluted.

**Recent Concerns and Controversies:**

As per recent earnings calls and 10-K filings:

* **Sabine Pass Liquefaction Project Delays:** Project delays and cost overruns are a concern for investors, as they can impact profitability and tie up capital. The issue of project delays and cost overruns was discussed during the Q2 2023 earnings call. 
* **Competition:** The rise of new LNG export facilities increases competition. For instance, during the Q4 2022 earnings call, management noted the increased competition and how it will increase the importance of commercial operations as new supply hits the market.

**Upcoming Catalysts:**

* **Completion of Corpus Christi Stage 3:**  This expansion is expected to drive revenue and earnings growth. As mentioned in Cheniere's Q2 2023 10-Q filing, the expansion remains on schedule.
* **Long-Term Contract Renewals:** As long-term contracts expire, Cheniere has the opportunity to renew at potentially higher prices given current market conditions.  However, the possibility of spot prices exceeding contract prices also poses a risk.
* **Diversification of Customers and Revenue:**  Expanding beyond its core business and customer base would reduce concentration risk. For instance, the company recently announced that they would be expanding into new segments beyond LNG, as per the Q4 2022 earnings call.
* **Deleveraging:**  Reducing debt would improve the company’s financial position, making it less vulnerable to swings in LNG prices.  This is particularly important given the cyclical nature of commodity markets. As per its SEC filings, the company generated substantial operating cash flows in recent years, which could be used toward this end.
