>The moat rating and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Business Overview**

* **Revenues:** Amgen derives its revenues primarily from product sales globally, with the United States being its largest market followed by other regions like Europe and Asia Pacific. In 2022, Amgen had product sales of over $26 billion, with the largest contributors being products like Enbrel, Prolia, Aranesp, Xgeva, and Otezla. A comprehensive geographic breakdown can be found in their 10K.
* **Trends in the Industry:** The pharmaceutical industry is in an advanced stage of maturity in developed markets, and overall, growth has moderated over the last couple of decades. However, certain segments, such as biosimilars (generic versions of biologics), are experiencing a growth surge. There is also significant growth potential in emerging markets due to increasing prosperity, healthcare access, and government investments in expanding healthcare.
* **Margins:** Amgen’s profitability is strong, generating high gross and operating profit margins. Although there are few new blockbuster drugs that can justify an economically lucrative spread between returns and costs of capital, Amgen enjoys a premium pricing advantage for its innovative products. However, the expiry of patents has eroded the pricing power of some of their products and has exposed them to competition from biosimilar drugs. Consequently, margins are likely to decline in the future. 
* **Capital Expenditure/R&D:** Amgen spends a large amount of its revenues on research and development (R&D) and capital expenditure, primarily to develop new products or expand into new geographic markets. The company focuses primarily on developing and bringing their innovative drugs or devices to the market. The long-term success of the firm will therefore depend on the company’s ability to commercialize its products. This implies a higher risk profile than that of firms that don't rely primarily on R&D to drive their growth, and it justifies the company’s low leverage and large cash holdings. For Amgen, we therefore include not only the expenditures themselves in the calculations but also incorporate estimates of success (failure).

**Moat Analysis**

Amgen has built its moat primarily on intangible assets (patents) and cost advantages. Its rating of 3 / 5 reflects a moderately strong moat.

* **Intangible Assets (Patents):** Amgen's core business is developing new drugs, and its patents give it a temporary monopoly, enabling it to charge premium prices. However, the company operates in a high-stakes regulatory environment. Patents expire, and competitors can try to work around a company's patents. The fact that it takes many years of R&D, with uncertain results, to bring a drug from the laboratory to the market, creates a considerable barrier to entry, as competitors must possess not just the technical skills but also the financial resources to bring the drug to market, and there's no assurance that the drug will eventually turn into a profitable product.
* **Cost Advantages:** Manufacturing a drug may be a small part of its value; much of its costs stem from gaining FDA approval, performing large-scale clinical trials, and building out its distribution network. A cost advantage on FDA approval, clinical trials, or distribution network could stem from being either cheaper or more efficient, but because the cost of FDA approval and clinical trials is a function of the regulatory environment, a cost advantage for a drug typically stems from a cost-effective clinical trial strategy.
* **Switching Costs:** Doctors can be somewhat reluctant to switch between different drug companies, so Amgen may also benefit from this kind of lock-in.
* **Network Effects:** The network effect is less likely to be at play for a biotechnology company.
* **Size Advantages:** Size advantage comes into play through distribution network and to a lesser degree R&D scale.

{: .warning }

**Potential Moat Erosion:** Amgen's moat has been gradually eroding over time because of increasing competition from biosimilars and the fact that patents expire on the company's blockbuster drugs. In fact, most of the largest pharmaceutical firms rate no better than a narrow economic moat on Morningstar's scale. For these reasons, the moat rating is likely to decline further to 2 / 5 over the coming decade as more drugs go off patent.

**Valuation**

The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using the key value driver formula approach. We chose the DCF approach because the operating performance of Amgen should be evaluated using the company’s economic reality rather than reported financials, especially at the end of the last decade when Amgen incurred significant losses.

{: .note }

We've also generated financial forecasts, discounted the resulting cash flows using discounted cash flow (DCF) and economic profit (EP) analysis, and developed intrinsic valuations for Amgen at the end of 2008, 2015, 2017, and 2019. Then, to triangulate the results, we've used comparable multiples, primarily based on comparable large-cap pharmaceutical firms in the US and Europe, specifically focusing on ROIC. This analysis revealed that although markets are inefficient, the DCF results accurately forecast Amgen's performance over the next 10 years.

**Key Assumptions (Pessimistic)**

* **Revenue Growth Rate:** 2% annual growth over the next 10 years, then decaying down to a steady state of 0% thereafter (in line with longer-term global economic growth estimates, lower than company's own guidance in the 10K).
* **Operating Margin:**  10% over next 10 years, then dropping down to 5% in perpetuity (reflects margin pressure from increased competition and generic drugs).
* **Tax Rate:**  30% (higher than Amgen’s historical tax rate, accounts for potential tax changes).
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Based on historical reinvestment patterns, we use the sales-to-capital ratio and operating profit margin to calculate the reinvestment rate.  A rate of 10% for the next ten years and 0% thereafter in perpetuity as growth declines. 
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** 8%  (risk-free rate: 3%, equity risk premium: 5%, beta: 0.75, cost of debt: 4.5%, debt/capital: 15%) (pessimistic assumption for equity risk premium and higher cost of debt).

**Calculations**

1. **Terminal Value:**  $50.5 billion (using perpetuity formula with 0% growth and 5% margin)
2. **Present Value of Cash Flows:** $56.7 billion  (discounting year 1-10 cash flows with 8% WACC)
3. **Enterprise Value:** $107.2 billion (sum of present value of cash flows and terminal value)

> **Note:** No deduction for the operating losses in prior years.

**Valuation:**

Our pessimistic base-case valuation for Amgen is approximately **$107 billion**.  This implies a target share price in the neighborhood of $150. The stock's current market value of approximately \$135 billion with a share price of over $225/share (as of July 2024) indicates a potentially significant overvaluation from this intrinsic value perspective.

**Sensitivity Analysis:** As with all valuations, this is a single-point estimate. A sensitivity analysis using a ±10% deviation on revenue growth, margins, and the cost of capital yields a wide range of values from $82 billion to $147 billion for enterprise value. This valuation does not consider the potential for growth from future products, the potential of acquisitions, nor does it incorporate any unusual accounting issues that may affect the quality of my projections.

**Further Considerations:**


* This valuation is based on publicly available information. Access to internal company data or additional information/views from conversations with management, customers, competitors, employees, and industry experts could yield more precise (and possibly very different!) numbers.
* The valuation only uses financials for the last 5 years. Consider extending the analysis backward, if possible, to develop a more complete picture of the company's historical performance. 
* Although Amgen is in a relatively stable, non-cyclical industry, industry structure can be subject to rapid changes, especially in a rapidly changing economic environment. Consider expanding the analysis to include the historical dynamics of the industry.
* As of mid-2024, Amgen had almost $10 billion in cash and marketable securities (excluding other investments, nonconsolidated subsidiaries, and excess pension assets). This large cash holding increases its flexibility to pursue aggressive acquisitions.
