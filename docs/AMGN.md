>The moat rating, management rating, catalyst score, and valuation are meant to reflect a pessimistic outlook, signaling potential competitive pressures and limited growth. This ensures that some margin of safety is already baked in.


**Moat (3/5):**

Amgen's moat stems from a combination of factors, including patents (though their strength is diminishing), brand name recognition, regulatory hurdles for biosimilars, and manufacturing scale. However, the increasing prevalence of biosimilars and the expiration of key patents erode the moat over time. As such, the moat is considered Narrow, per Pat Dorsey's framework in *The Little Book That Builds Wealth*. Specifically, Amgen's R&D and product innovation should give it the edge to continue delivering potentially new, and profitable, products.  

**Management (3/5):**

Amgen’s management team, led by CEO Robert Bradway, receives a rating of 3. While the company has delivered solid financial performance over the last decade, concerns about capital allocation and pipeline productivity temper the rating. These points contribute to the overall management assessment:

* **Capital Allocation:** While management has engaged in share repurchases and acquisitions, the success of these initiatives in creating long-term shareholder value is questionable. As Warren Buffet argues in *The Essays of Warren Buffet*, share repurchases only create value when they are done at prices below intrinsic value. Amgen has also acquired several smaller companies but has not demonstrated consistent success from mergers and acquisitions.
* **Pipeline:** Although Amgen has a significant pipeline, its ability to translate R&D expenses into commercially successful drugs is uncertain. This aligns with Kenneth Fisher's skepticism towards dependence on R&D as discussed in *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits*.
* **Communication:** Amgen’s investor relations provide detailed financial information, but their communications often emphasize short-term earnings and metrics, rather than long-term value drivers, per McKinsey’s guidance in *Valuation*.
* **Compensation:** Executive compensation is tied to the company's financial performance and shareholder returns, which is positive. However, the significant use of stock options as a component of compensation raises concerns about potential short-term incentives.

**Catalyst (2/5):**

Amgen faces both opportunities and challenges:

* **Biosimilars:** The continued entry of biosimilars exerts pressure on pricing and market share for key products.
* **Pipeline:**  The success of pipeline drugs, particularly in oncology and inflammation, could be a catalyst.  However, as discussed in Aswath Damodaran’s *The Little Book of Valuation*, the success rate for drug development is low. Specifically, management provided an update in Amgen’s second-quarter earnings call that they are continuing to advance several programs, such as rocatinlimab, olpasiran, and bemarituzumab. Based on Amgen’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management highlighted the potential of several drugs for the prevention of migraine.
* **Cost Control:** Successful cost-cutting initiatives could improve profitability.  However, as Damodaran highlights, cost cutting is often easier said than done.
* **Acquisitions:**  Strategic acquisitions could boost growth but also carry integration and financial risks.

The catalyst rating of 2 reflects a moderate potential for positive catalysts, tempered by significant risks and uncertainties.

**Valuation ($74.33/share):**

A discounted cash flow (DCF) model, per McKinsey’s *Valuation*, was employed to estimate Amgen's intrinsic value, focusing on free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).  The following key assumptions were used:

* **Revenue Growth:** Based on the firm's recent cash flows, we assume continued slow growth of 2 percent annually for the first five years, dropping down to stable growth of 1 percent thereafter. This is a conservative estimate that incorporates the impact of competition from biosimilars and uncertainty about the success of Amgen's pipeline.
* **Operating Margin:** We forecast operating margins to rise from approximately 14.7 percent in the trailing twelve-month period to 15 percent in the long term, based on the industry averages. Specifically, we used comparable company operating margin data and management’s margin expansion plans. This margin estimate is lower than the company's historical levels, reflecting increased competition and cost pressures.
* **Reinvestment Rate:** Using the sales-to-capital relationship and assuming reinvestment in the business at approximately 25 percent, the reinvestment rate is set at 115.68%.
* **Cost of Capital (WACC):** Assuming a target capital structure of 15 percent debt and 85 percent equity, we arrived at a WACC of 8.3 percent.
* **Terminal Value:**  The terminal value is computed with a long-term growth rate of 1% in conjunction with a return on capital of 12%. This incorporates growth and the effects of acquisitions as revealed in Koller, Goedhart, and Wessels' *Valuation*, along with other resources.
* **R&D Capitalization:** In order to improve performance assessments of long-term investments we have capitalized R&D expense over the previous 10 years and adjusted NOPLAT accordingly. Per Fisher, R&D activities contribute towards eventual company growth and are not only for the benefit of short-term profits. We see the immediate effects in the form of growing revenues and losses, thus it makes more sense to recognize them over a longer period. This process is presented in more detail in Damodaran's *The Dark Side of Valuation*.

{: .highlight }

Based upon these assumptions, the DCF model produces a per share value of **$74.33**. This is significantly lower than the stock’s recent all time highs, but given the uncertainty and risk inherent in the biotech sector, we find this to be a more reasonable valuation.


**Detailed Valuation Calculation:**

1. **Project Cash Flows:** Project revenue growth, operating margins, and reinvestment needs for the next 10 years (see Table 3.8 for assumptions).

2. **Calculate Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):** FCFF = After-tax operating income * (1 - Reinvestment Rate).

3. **Compute Terminal Value:** Terminal Value = (FCFF in Terminal Year * (1+Long-term Growth Rate)) / (Cost of Capital - Long-term Growth Rate)

4. **Discount Cash Flows and Terminal Value:** Discount the projected FCFF and the terminal value back to present value using the WACC (see Table 3.9).

5. **Calculate Enterprise Value:** Sum the present values of the FCFF and terminal value.

6. **Calculate Equity Value:** Subtract market value of debt and other non-equity claims (e.g., minority interests) from enterprise value.

7. **Calculate Value per Share:** Divide equity value by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding.

| Terminal Year | | 35.00% | $49,316 | | $49,316 | 7.50% | $555,706 |

**Additional Notes:**

Amgen faces ongoing legal proceedings and regulatory risks. For instance, Amgen is appealing two decisions on patents expiring in 2029. Furthermore, management announced an exchange offer for some of the company’s outstanding 2.200% senior notes due in 2025 in the third-quarter 2023 earnings call.


**Overall, Amgen is a good but not great company in a competitive sector.**  While its current profitability is attractive, the patent cliff and the increasing prevalence of biosimilars pose significant threats to its future cash flows.  The valuation reflects these risks, and at the right price, Amgen could be a reasonable long-term investment.  However, the true test of any company lies not in its current performance but in its ability to adapt and grow and create economic value, something that remains to be seen for Amgen.
